<blockquote>
<p>If an employee is told upon reporting for work that there is no work available and is immediately sent home, he/she will not be considered to have spent any time working. If, however, the employee reports for work at the scheduled place at the prescribed time and is not immediately sent home but is suffered or permitted to wait for work after the regular shift was scheduled to begin, the time spent in waiting between the scheduled commencement of the shift and the time the employee starts work or is sent home is counted as working time. Some employment agreements provide for the payment of a minimum number of hours pay to an employee on those occasions when he/she reports for work and none is available. Pay arrangements of this kind are discussed in IB 778.220 - 778.222. (See FOH 32d04.)</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Rest periods of short duration, running from 5 minutes to about 20 minutes, are common in industry. They promote the efficiency of the employee and are customarily paid for as working time. They must be counted as hours worked.</p></li>
<li><p>Where a regular rest period of known duration is longer than 20 minutes, the waiting time rules apply. In other words, if the employees are free to go where they please, and the rest period is long enough to permit the employees to use it for their own purposes, and if bona fide and not an attempt to evade or circumvent the FLSA or PCA, such periods are not hours worked.</p></li>
<li><p>Unauthorized extensions of authorized breaks are not counted as hours worked for an employee when the employer had expressly and unambigously communicated to the employee that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The authorized break may only last for a specific length of time;</p></li>

<p>If the employer designates the exact time for reporting and the homeworker reports at that time and is compelled to wait, the time spent in waiting must be considered as hours worked. If the homeworker reports at a time which is not prearranged or at a time other than that specified by the employer and the employer is not prepared to accept the finished goods and charge out new material to the homeworker, the time spent in waiting will not be considered as hours worked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An employee who is required to be on duty for less than 24 hours is working even though permitted to sleep or engage in other personal activities when not busy. For example, a telephone operator who is required to be on duty for specified hours is working even though permitted to sleep when not answering calls, It makes no difference that facilities are furnished for sleeping. The employee’s time is given to the employer. The employee is required to be on duty and the time is work time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are certain instances in which clothes changing and washup activities by employees on the premises of the employer are integral parts of the principal activities of the employees because the nature of the work makes the clothes changing and washing indispensable to the performance of productive work by the employees, but the collective bargaining agreement in effect in the establishment is silent as to whether this time should be included in, or excluded from, hours worked. Where such clothes changing and washup activities are the only preshift and postshift activities performed by the employees on the premises of the employer, the time spent in these activities has never been paid for or counted as hours worked by the employer, and the employees have never opposed or resisted this policy in any manner although they have apparently been fully aware of it, there is a custom or practice under the collective bargaining agreement to exclude this time from the measured working time, and FLSA Sec. 3(o) applies to the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="b01a.-clothes-changing-and-washup-time-on-a-formula-basis."><strong>31b01a. Clothes changing and washup time on a formula basis.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>An employer may set up a formula by which employees are allowed given amounts of time to perform clothes changing and washup activities, provided the time set is reasonable in relation to the actual time required to perform such activities. The time allowed will be considered reasonable if a majority of the employees usually perform the activities within the given time.</p>

<h4 id="b02-employees-residing-temporarily-on-employers-premises."><strong>31b02 Employees residing temporarily on employer’s premises.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>There are certain circumstances (usually at locations such as hard-to-reach construction jobs, isolated dredging barges and offshore drilling sites) where practical considerations make it necessary for employees to remain temporarily on the employer’s premises and to eat and sleep there during their stay. In such situations, the employees shall not be considered as on “duty of 24 hours or more” if they have a regular schedule of hours and thereafter are relieved of duties except for extra work required by the exigencies of the job. Only the actual working time need be counted as hours worked.</p></li>
<li><p>The rules governing “duty of 24 hours or more” (IB 785.22) are applicable where, from all the conditions of employment, including the understanding of the parties, it is clear that the employee is employed to wait rather than waiting to be employed. Among the factors which would support such a conclusion are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>the employee has no regular schedule of hours, or a schedule in name only, and is required to perform work on a helter-skelter basis at any time during the day or night; or</p></li>
<li><p>the employee has a regular schedule of hours but the unscheduled periods are so cut through with frequent work calls that this time is not his/her own.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Some employers, such as offshore oil well drilling contractors, arrange transportation to remote locations in such a way that two crews having regular work schedules as in (a) above, arrive at the same time. One crew will ordinarily go to work immediately and the other must wait through an entire shift (or a substantial portion thereof) before starting work. At the end of the tour of duty at the worksite, one crew, after completing its last shift, must wait through the last shift (or a substantial portion thereof) of the other crew before crews are transported back from the worksite at the same time. Such waiting time on the initial and terminal days is as much an integral part of those particular 24-hour periods as the idle periods between the regular workshifts on the other workdays. Where the employees are not on call and are completely relieved of duty, such idle time on the initial and terminal days is not considered hours worked.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="b04.-radio-announcers-and-performers."><strong>31b04. Radio announcers and performers.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Time spent by performers, including radio announcers on out-of-stretch (see FOH 32d08a) radio and television programs for which talent fees (as defined in Reg 550) are paid, is not counted as hours worked provided the fee is sufficient to compensate for the straight time and OT compensation which would normally be due for such time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="b05.-participation-in-athletic-contests."><strong>31b05. Participation in athletic contests.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>As an enforcement policy, Wage-Hour will not consider as hours worked under the FLSA or PCA any time spent by an employee as a participant in, or as an umpire, referee, scorer, or similar official in an athletic contest sponsored by the employer, if the participation of the employee in these activities is completely voluntary and if his/her regular employment is not conditioned upon participating in these activities.</p>

<h4 id="b08.-emergency-government-employment-and-disaster-relief-work."><strong>31b08. Emergency Government employment and disaster relief work.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Since persons summoned or called upon by Government or other public officials, pursuant to statutory authority, to engage in firefighting, national defense, civil defense, flood control, or other activities, become in legal effect employees of the State or Federal Government, the employer whose employees have been so engaged is not required to consider time spent in such activities as hours worked for the company during the w/w. Any money paid for such activities need not be included in determining the regular rate.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, where contractors are specifically requested by Federal, State, or local authority under the general police powers of the Government concerned to furnish employees to render disaster relief services such as rescuing injured persons, restoring municipal services, clearing streets, and controlling damage, these contractors and their employees will be considered employees of the Government and the Act applied in the same manner as in (a) above. Thus, the time spent on such work need not be counted as hours worked, and any compensation paid for such emergency work need not be included in the regular rate. Such services are normally furnished without compensation to the contractor (or at cost) and the arrangement is terminated as soon as immediate needs are met.</p></li>
<li><p>If a contractor contracts with a Government agency for work following a disaster, to be performed as a commercial venture or as part of his/her regular business activity (as distinguished from (b) above), the Act shall be applied in the regular manner.</p></li>

<li><p>Time spent in sleeping berths in trucks.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Berths in trucks are regarded as adequate sleeping facilities for the purposes of IB 785.41 and 785.22. However, this rule applies to sleeping berth time of truck drivers or helpers only when they are on continuous tours of duty during trips away from home for a period of 24 hours or more. If the trip begins and ends at the home station and is performed within one working day (less than 24 hours), all time on duty on the truck is time worked (except, of course, for bona fide meal periods) even though some of that time is spent in the sleeping berth. (FOH 31b00.)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Tours of duty of 24 hours or more but less than 48 hours.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>FOH 31b12 and IB 785.22 describe excludable sleep time for hours of duty of 24 hours or more. On continuous tours of duty of more than 24 hours but less than 48 hours, one extra hour of sleep time in excess of the maximum 8 hours may be claimed for each hour beyond 40 that a continuous tour of duty extends, provided that the employee has actually slept such number of hours. For example, in a 42-hour continuous tour of duty, no more than 10 hours could be deducted for sleep time. Similarly, in a 45-hour continuous tour, a maximum of 13 hours could be deducted. However, in the absence of an express or implied agreement concerning the exclusion of sleep time, the time spent sleeping constitutes hours worked even though the tour of duty exceeds 24 hours. See also 31b12.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Continuous tours of duty.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>As indicated in IB 785.12 through 785.16, waiting or layover time will be considered off-duty time and not part of the employee’s hours of work if the employee is completely relieved of all duties and responsibilities, is permitted to leave the truck or temporary station to go anywhere, knows in advance that work will not resume until a specified time, and the period of layover is of sufficient length to be used effectively for the employee’s own purposes. Thus, no standard rule of thumb, such as “2-hour layover time” or “4-hour layover time” can be used to unequivocally state that a layover period of such length has automatically broken a continuous tour of duty. Whether or not a continuous tour of duty greater than 24 hours is interrupted by a waiting or layover time is a question of fact. For example, if a truck driver stops for a layover of 2 hours, but the stopping point happens to be in a remote location which has no available facilities (restaurants, etc.), the tour of duty has not been interrupted and the “off-duty” time is compensable hours worked.</p></li>
<li><p>With regard to team truck drivers, because of the special circumstances under which they work, we would not regard a bona fide layover period as breaking a continuous tour of duty if the employer paid wages for that period.</p></li>
<li><p>Time spent in noncompensable bona fide meal periods and bona fide regularly scheduled sleeping periods would not break a continuous tour of duty provided that such periods do not exceed the maximum limitations in 785.22 and the “40-hour rule” set forth in (b) above.

<blockquote>
<p>In some instances an employee of a newspaper or radio or television station will read a particular book with the view to a possible book review story for use in the newspaper or on the air. This presents no problem as to hours worked where the reading is done in the course of the employee’s regular duties at the establishment or elsewhere at any time at the employer’s specific request. However, the reading may be done away from the employer’s establishment and outside duty hours, such as at the employee’s home in the evening, and on a speculative basis - that is, with the thought that a book review might be prepared. In such cases there is a substantial question as to whether the reading was done for the benefit of the employer or for the pleasure or information of the employee. In such cases, WH will not assert that such reading is hours worked even though the book is subsequently reviewed in the newspaper or on the air.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>If an employee is required to be on duty 24 hours or more, the employer and employee may agree to exclude a bona fide regularly scheduled sleeping period, provided adequate sleeping facilities are furnished by the employer and the employee can usually enjoy an uninterrupted night’s sleep. (See IB 785.22.)</p></li>
<li><p>It is the position of WH that a reasonable night’s sleep means that an employee obtains at least five hours of sleep during the scheduled period. These five hours need not be five continuous uninterrupted hours of sleep. However, if interruptions are so frequent as to prevent reasonable periods of sleep totaling not less than five hours, the entire period would be considered hours worked.</p></li>

<p>Where an “on-call” employee performs services for his employer at home and yet has long periods of uninterrupted leisure during which he can engage in the normal activities of living, Wage-Hour will accept any reasonable agreement of the parties for determining the number of hours worked. As an example, this policy will apply to an “on-call” employee who is required by the employer to remain at home to receive telephone calls from customers when the company office is closed. The agreement should take into account not only the actual time spent in answering the calls but also some allowance for the restriction on the employee’s freedom to engage in personal activities resulting from the duty of answering the telephone.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Where there is a “reasonable agreement” between employer and employee pursuant to IB 785.23, such an agreement establishes the hours the employee is considered to work, but precise R/K regarding hours worked is not required. The employer may keep a time record showing the schedule adopted in the agreement and indicate that the employee’s work time generally coincided with the agreement or schedule. If it is found by the parties that there is significant deviation from the initial agreement, a new agreement should be reached reflecting the actual facts.</p></li>
<li><p>The “reasonable agreement” must be an employer-employee agreement and not a unilateral decision by the employer. Such an agreement should normally be in writing in order to preclude any possible misunderstanding of the terms and conditions of an individual’s employment. It must take into account not only the time spent working but also the time when the employee may engage in normal private pursuits, with sufficient time for eating, sleeping, entertaining, and other periods of complete freedom from all duties when he or she may leave the premises for personal reasons. The agreement must also consider such relevant factors as the degree to which the use of the employee’s personal time is limited or restricted by the conditions of employment and the extent of interruption to eating and sleeping periods.

<li><p>The “reasonable agreement” referred to in IB 785.23 may apply to an employee who resides on the employer’s premises five days a week, since such employee may be considered as residing on the employer’s premises “for extended periods of time”. (See Reg 552.102.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ordinarily, an employee residing on the employer’s premises for 120 hours or more in a week would meet the requirements of (a) above. Where less than 120 hours in a week are spent residing on the employer’s premises, five consecutive days or nights would also qualify as residing on the premises “for extended periods of time.” For example, employees who are on duty from 9 a.m. Monday until 5 p.m. Friday would also be considered to reside on the employer’s premises. Even though on duty for less than 120 hours, they are on duty for five consecutive days (Monday through Friday). The fact that they sleep over only four nights does not alter this conclusion. Similarly, employees who are on duty from 9 p.m. Monday until 9 a.m. Saturday would also be considered to reside on their employer’s premises since they are on duty for five consecutive nights (Monday night through Friday night).</p></li>

<p>Under Reg 553.222(c), where an employer and employee had agreed that time spent sleeping be compensable, the employer cannot make unilateral changes in the agreement in order to exclude sleep time from compensable hours of work and then consider the employee’s continued employment to be acceptance of such change. Some form of uncoerced mutual assent is necessary to consider the parties’ agreement validly changed.</p>
<p>Reg 553.222(c) does not address the converse, i.e., the procedure for making sleep time compensable where there was previously an expressed or implied agreement to exclude such time from compensable hours of work. Consequently, an employee could unilaterally withdraw his/her consent and the employer would then be required to compensate the employee for any future sleep time that may occur. However, the employer would not be required to agree to a continuation of the same terms and conditions of employment. The employer and employee would be free to establish new conditions of employment, such as rate of pay, hours of work, or reassignment. Where employees are represented for collective bargaining purposes, such changes in the terms or conditions of employment could be addressed within the collective bargaining process.

<blockquote>
<p>The typical temporary help firm (such as Peakload, Inc. and Manpower, Inc.) is engaged in supplying workers employed by the firm on an “as needed” basis to various establishments. A person who desires employment usually registers with the temporary help firm. For certain types of jobs the registrant usually voluntarily “shows up” at some central location where he awaits employment opportunity. If work is available or becomes available, he is sent or taken to the customer’s establishment. If accepted by the customer, he remains and performs the work of that employer. At the end of the day, the worker is free to go home and collect his pay later or to return to the central location to be paid for his work. The circumstances vary. If the employment understanding clearly is that the pay or the time of the employee begins and ends at the customer’s establishment, waiting for assignments at the central location or in travel from there to the customer’s establishment and return would not be compensable worktime. In other words, his working time is computed in the same manner as if he had gone directly from his home to the customer’s establishment and returned home from there at the end of the day. This would be true even though he may be assigned to work at the same customer’s establishment for more than one day.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Background:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In some industries employers utilize somewhat modified vans or trucks for use by employees who perform service work at a customer’s home or business establishment. The vehicle provides a necessary means for the employee to transport needed parts, tools, equipment, etc., to various work sites during the day. The employer may give employees the opportunity to drive the vehicle between home and work on a voluntary basis.</p></li>
<li><p>In some instances, the employee starts the work day by calling the employer’s dispatcher from home, receiving one or more work assignments to begin the work day, and traveling directly from home to the first work site rather than traveling first to the employer’s establishment and then to the work site. At the end of the day the employee may be required to call the employer’s dispatcher to advise that the last service call for the day has been completed and that the employee is leaving the last work site for home, where the employee parks and locks the vehicle. During this call to the dispatcher, the employee may or may not receive assignments for the next day.</p></li>
<li><p>WH policy on the compensability of travel time in such situations was set forth in an Administrator’s opinion letter dated August 5, 1994. In light of the concerns expressed by both employers and employees, and the possible effects of applying this interpretation in a wide variety of industries, the Secretary of Labor, on October 19, 1994, deferred any WH efforts to enforce the policy in that opinion letter while a review was undertaken.</p></li>

<p>An Administrator’s opinion letter was issued on April 3, 1995, which withdrew the August 5, 1994, opinion letter and set forth WH’s position in this matter.

<h4 id="d00.-ambulance-services."><strong>31d00. Ambulance services.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Numerous hours worked questions may arise with respect to employees engaged in ambulance services. The most common are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Less than 24 hours duty. Ambulance employees who are required to be on duty at their employer’s place of business for periods of less than 24 hours are working even though they are permitted to sleep or engage in other personal activities when not busy. (See IB 785.21.) However, the usual rules with respect to meal periods would apply when they are relieved of all duties for the purpose of eating meals.</p></li>
<li><p>Duty of 24 hours or more. (See IB 785.22.) Some ambulance employees may be required by the employer to be on duty on his premises for 24 hours or more. The parties may agree to exclude bona fide meal periods and a regularly scheduled sleeping period of not more than 8 hours, provided the employer furnishes adequate sleeping facilities and the employee can usually enjoy uninterrupted sleep during the period. If the sleeping period is more than 8 hours, only 8 hours may be excluded from hours worked. Any interruption of the sleeping period to respond to calls must be counted as hours worked. If the period is interrupted to such an extent that the employee cannot get a reasonable “night’s sleep”, the entire sleeping period must be counted as hours worked. For enforcement purposes, the “night’s sleep” will be considered reasonable if the employee can get at least 5 hours sleep during the period. Thus, where these tests are met, the actual sleeping time (i.e., not less than 5 hours and not more than 8 hours) may be excluded from hours worked. Off-duty periods during which the employee has complete freedom from duties and may leave the premises for his own purposes may also be excluded.</p></li>
<li><p>Employees who reside on the employer’s premises permanently or for extended periods of time. Some ambulance service employees reside on their employer’s premises. In such cases, the employee is not working all the time he is on the premises. In determining hours worked, bona fide off-duty time need not be counted and any reasonable agreement of the parties which takes into consideration all the pertinent facts will be accepted. (See IB 785.23.) In the absence of an agreement, the Inv should make a reasonable determination giving recognition to the facts in the particular case which indicate the amount of time that the employee does have to eat, sleep, and devote to his own pursuits.</p></li>
<li><p>On-call time. Except where the employee is on duty 24 hours or more or resides on the premises, time spent by an employee in an “on-call” status at his employer’s establishment is hours worked. On the other hand, where an employee is not required to remain on his employer’s premises but is free to engage in his own pursuits and merely required to leave word where he may be reached, the time so spent is not considered to be hours worked. See IB 785.17.) If the employee does in fact go out on a call, the time actually spent in making the call including travel time is hours worked. Also, there may be situations when calls are so frequent or the “on-call” conditions so restrictive that the employee is not really free to use the intervening periods for his own benefit. In such cases he may be considered as “engaged to wait” rather than “waiting to be engaged” and the waiting time would also be counted as hours worked.</p></li>
<li><p>Employee who takes ambulance to his home. In the ordinary case where an employer permits an employee to drive an ambulance to and from his home for the employee’s own convenience, the time so spent in driving is not hours worked (see FOH 31c01). If the employee is required to take the ambulance home in order to be able to respond to calls immediately, all the time spent in driving would be hours worked. The time the ambulance remains parked idly outside the employee’s residence, and the employee is free to engage in his own pursuits subject only to the understanding that he leave word at his home or with company officials where he may be reached, would not be regarded as hours worked under the Act. The waiting time would be counted as hours worked only in situations of the type referred to in the last two sentences of paragraph (4). If the ambulance is parked at the employee’s home, the employee would be considered working from the time he sets out on a call until the time he returns to his home.</p></li>

<li><p>Employees of these group homes may have regularly scheduled off-duty periods during the day (for which they are not paid) which might ordinarily break a continuous tour of duty of 24 hours or more. Therefore, a question arises as to whether their sleep time can be deducted from working time.</p></li>
<li><p>Full-time houseparents.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The facilities in question employ houseparents, as well as relief staff in many cases, to provide custodial care for individuals who reside at the facilities. The houseparents sleep overnight, sometimes as many as 5 or 6 days in a row, after which they get a day or 2 off. In addition, the houseparents may also have several hours off each afternoon, when they are free to do whatever they choose, including leaving the premises. They sleep in private quarters separate from the residents of the group home. Many of these houseparents maintain permanent residences elsewhere in the community, but others have as their only residence the facility for the mentally retarded. Where such full-time house parents meet the standards set forth in FOH 31b20, they are considered to be residing on the premises in accordance with IB 785.23. Therefore, the sleeptime rules in IB 785.22 and .23 will be applied.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Relief employees.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The relief staff may stay overnight at a facility for one or more nights a week. During a 24-hour period, these employees may also have regularly scheduled off-duty time during the day with complete freedom from all responsibilities. They, too, sleep in private quarters separate from the residents of the group home.</p></li>
<li><p>In situations where a community residence employs at least one employee who resides on the employer’s premises “for extended periods of time” (see FOH 31b20 and IB 785.23), the employer and a relief employee who performs essentially the same duties as such full-time employee may enter into a “reasonable agreement” (see FOH 31(b)(18)(b)) to hours worked. Such an agreement, entered into in advance of the performance of any work, may provide that sleeping time of up to 8 hours can be excluded from compensable hours of work, regardless of the length of the tour of duty involved. Also, a mutually agreed-upon amount of off-duty time, during which the employee is completely free from all responsibilities, can be excluded from compensable hours of work. Since the residents of such facilities are usually on the premises all day on weekends, the hours worked by weekend relief employees may be significantly longer than the hours worked by the employees who work weekdays. Agreements with weekend employees must reflect such differences.</p></li>
