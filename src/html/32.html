<h4 id="b00-computation-of-regular-rate-of-pay."><strong>32b00 Computation of regular rate of pay.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>An employee’s regular rate of pay is computed by dividing his total remuneration for his hours worked in the w/w, minus any true OT pay and any other specific statutory exclusions, by the number of hours of work for which the remuneration was paid.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="b00a-regular-rate-for-wws-in-which-employee-receives-no-pay-or-only-partial-payment."><strong>32b00a Regular rate for w/w’s in which employee receives no pay or only partial payment.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The regular rate for purposes of BW computations for OT weeks in which an employee subject to the OT provisions of the Acts receive no pay or only part of his pay shall be determined on the basis of the established practice, agreement, or understanding. In the case of an employee paid solely on the basis of an hourly rate, this hourly rate shall be the regular rate for purposes of computations during such weeks. Similarly, where it is determined that the practice or agreement by which an employee’ s wages are computed is, for example, an established weekly salary, piece rate or day rate, such salary, piece rate or day rate shall be used to compute the regular rate. The following examples illustrate the application of this principle:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>An employee works a total of 48 hours in a particular week and receives no pay for that w/w. He regularly receives a weekly salary of $96 as ST payment for all hours in a week. For the w/w in question the employee’s regular rate would be $2 an hour ($96 divided by 48 hours). He would be due $2 an hour for the first 40 hours and $3 an hour for each hour over 40 or a total of $104 for the week.</p></li>
<li><p>An employee is paid $1.90 per hour and has 38 recorded hours and has received $72.20 but has actually worked 44 hours. He would be due $1.90 for the 39th hour, $1.90 for the 40th hour, and $2.85 for each additional hour.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If the regular rate cannot be determined as in (a) above, or if the regular rate so determined is less than the legal minimum, the regular rate for OT purposes shall be the legal minimum (see FOH 32j01 and 32j02).</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="b01-hourly-rate-employees."><strong>32b01 Hourly rate employees.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Where an employee is employed solely on the basis of a single hourly rate that rate is his “regular rate”. If, in addition to his earnings at the hourly rate of pay, other payments are made, such as a production bonus, the amount of the bonus must be added to his total straight time earnings. The new “regular rate” is then determined by dividing the total straight time earnings by the number of hours worked.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="b01a-hourly-rate-employees-paid-semimonthly-or-monthly."><strong>32b01a Hourly rate employees paid semimonthly or monthly.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>It is permissible under the FLSA OT requirements for hourly rate employees to receive semimonthly or monthly payments which include OT premium if the requirements as described in FOH 32j11 are met.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="b02-pieceworkers."><strong>32b02 Pieceworkers.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>When an employee is employed on a piece rate basis, his regular hourly rate of pay is computed by adding together his total weekly earnings from piece rates and all other sources (such as production bonuses) and any sums paid for waiting time or other hours worked (except statutory exclusions). This sum is then divided by the number of hours worked in the week to yield the pieceworker’s “regular rate” for that week. In some cases, the pieceworker is hired on a piece rate basis with a minimum hourly guarantee. Where the total piece rate earnings for the week fall short of the amount that would be earned for the total hours at the guaranteed rate, the employee is paid the difference. In those weeks in which the “make-up” payment is made, the employee is in fact paid at an hourly rate and the minimum hourly guaranty which he was paid is his regular rate for that week.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="b03-day-rates-and-job-rates."><strong>32b03 Day rates and job rates.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>If the employee is paid a flat sum for a day’ s work or for doing a particular job without regard to the number of hours worked in the day or at the job, and if he receives no other form of compensation for his services, his regular rate is determined by totaling all the sums received in the workweek at the day or job rates and dividing by the total hours actually worked.</p>

<h4 id="b04-salaried-employees."><strong>32b04 Salaried employees.</strong></h4>
<h4 id="b04a-general-rule."><strong>32b04a General rule.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>If an employee is employed solely on a weekly salary basis his regular hourly rate of pay, on which premium pay for OT must be calculated, is computed by dividing the straight time salary by the number of hours for which the salary is intended to compensate. Where there was a written or oral agreement between the employer and the employee as to the number of hours which the salary was to compensate and it is determined that in actual practice the terms of the agreement have been modified, the practices of the parties will control. Where the salary covers a period longer than a w/w, such as a month, it must be reduced to its w/w equivalent. A monthly salary is converted to its equivalent weekly wage by multiplying by 12 (months) and dividing by 52 (weeks) or by multiplying by the coefficient 0.2308. A semimonthly salary is translated into its equivalent weekly wage by multiplying by 24 and dividing by 52 or by multiplying by the coefficient 0.4615.</p></li>
<li><p>For purposes of Sec 7(j) of the amended Act, a monthly salary is converted into its bi-weekly equivalent by multiplying by 12 (months) and dividing by 26 (bi-weekly periods) or by multiplying by the coefficient 0.4615. A semi-monthly salary is translated into its equivalent bi-weekly wage by multiplying by 24 and dividing by 26 or by multiplying by the coefficient 0.9230.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="b04b-irregular-hours-worked."><strong>32b04b Irregular hours worked.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>If an employee is given a stipulated salary with the understanding that it constitutes straight time pay for all hours he works, and if his hours of work fluctuate from week to week, his regular rate of pay ordinarily will vary from week to week in accordance with the number of hours worked each week. The regular rate, of course, cannot be less than the applicable MW. Since straight time compensation has already been paid, such an employee must receive additional OT compensation for each OT hour in a particular w/w computed at not less than one-half the regular rate obtained by dividing the weekly salary by the number of hours worked in that w/w. If the employer to avoid weekly computations chooses to pay extra half-time based on the salary divided by 40 hours, such a method is permissible.</p></li>
<li><p>The above rule will apply where an employee works a varying number of hours, and normally receives his full salary regardless of how few the scheduled hours may be in a particular week, even though occasional disciplinary deductions for willful absence or tardiness are made. Disciplinary deductions of course, may not cut into the MW or OT pay required by the Act.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, an employee employed on a fixed salary basis for irregular hours of work may be paid a pro rata share of his salary in the initial or terminal week of his employment, when he is not in payroll status for the entire week.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="b05-employees-employed-at-two-rates."><strong>32b05 Employees employed at two rates.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Where an employee in a single w/w works at two or more different types of work for which different hourly rates at not less than the legal minimum have been established, his regular rate for that week is the weighted average of the rates; that is his total earnings (except statutory exclusions) at the different rates are divided by the total number of hours he worked in the w/w.</p>

<h4 id="b06-payments-other-than-cash."><strong>32b06 Payments other than cash.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Where employees are paid goods or facilities which are regarded as part of their wages, the reasonable cost to the employer of the goods or the facilities must be included in the regular rate.</p>

<h4 id="b07-pms-push-money-and-other-wage-payments-made-by-suppliers."><strong>32b07 PM’s (push money) and other wage payments made by suppliers.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Certain retail establishment sales employees (for example, those who sell cosmetics and related items) may receive, in addition to the wages paid by their employer, payments from manufacturers or distributors for selling certain items or brands. Such payments may be made directly to the sales employees or to the employer for distribution to the employees. All such payments to employees for their work are “wages” and must be recorded by the employer and included in the regular rate of pay of the employees involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="b08-annual-salary-earned-in-shorter-period---regular-rate."><strong>32b08 Annual salary earned in shorter period - regular rate.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Certain employment such as that in schools does not normally constitute 12 months of work each year. For the convenience of the employee, the annual salary earned during the duty months is often paid in equal monthly installments throughout the entire year. For purposes of finding the regular rate of pay for OT purpose in such cases, the annual salary is considered in relation to the duty month rather than in relation to the entire year. Thus, for example, a school bus driver may receive an annual salary of $3000 for 10 months duty but be paid equal monthly installments of $250 each. In such a case, he is considered as being paid at the salary rate of $300 per month or $69.23 per week. The regular rate for OT purposes is found in the usual manner based on this weekly salary. (See FOH 22b11 and 30b18.)</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>FLSA Sec 7(e) requires the inclusion in the regular rate of all remuneration for employment except seven specified types of payments including certain bonuses. (For a discussion of remuneration, other than bonuses, excludable from the regular rate, see FOH 32d.) Bonuses which do not qualify for exclusion from the regular rate must be totaled with other earnings to determine the rate on which OT pay must be based. (See IB 778.208.)</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of bonuses which would normally be included in the regular rate are</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

</ol></li>
<li><p>Where a substantial group of employees receive uniform treatment in the actual payment of a bonus, the statements of a scattered few will not be conclusive in determining whether there is, or is not, a prior contract, agreement, or promise causing the employee to expect such payments regularly.

Statements such as “I was told about the quarterly bonus”, “When I was first employed I was told of this bonus”, “I believe that Mr.----------told me about this bonus when I was hired”, or “When I was first employed it was mentioned as a part of the pay I was to receive” are not in themselves conclusive statements.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>If a bonus covers only one weekly pay period, the amount of the bonus is merely added to the other earnings of the employee (except statutory exclusions) and the total divided by the total hours worked by the employee.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the calculation of a bonus is deferred over a period of time longer than one workweek, the employer may disregard the bonus in computing the regular hourly rate until the amount of the bonus can be ascertained. At the time the amount of the bonus is ascertained, it must be apportioned back over the workweeks of the period during which it may be said to have been earned, so that the employee will receive an additional amount of compensation for each week in which he worked OT during the period. This additional amount will be based on one-half the hourly rate of pay allocable to the bonus for that week multiplied by the number of OT hours worked during the week</p></li>
<li><p>If it is impractical to allocate the bonus among the workweeks of the period in proportion to the amount of the bonus actually earned each week, some other reasonable and equitable method of allocation should be adopted. For example, it may be assumed that the employee earned an equal amount of bonus each hour worked in the bonus period. The hourly increase is then determined by dividing the total bonus by the number of hours worked by the employee du ring the period for which it is paid.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Whether a bonus may be distributed as a percentage of total earnings of each participating employee or by the boosted hour method to achieve compliance with the OT provisions of the FLSA or PCA, depends on whether the additional money to be paid is a true bonus or whether it is a device to evade the payment of OT. If the so-called “regular rate” of the employee is so low as to be obviously fictitious, the “bonus” in all probability will be a part of the regular straight-time earnings upon which OT compensation must be computed. On the other hand, if the additional money to be paid is a true bonus, it may be distributed in proportion to the total earnings (exclusive of the bonus) of each participating employee properly computed to include time and one-half for the OT hours or in proportion to the boosted hours worked during the bonus period.</p></li>
<li><p>Extra payments not directly related to hours worked, production, or efficiency, such as profit-sharing type bonuses and year-end or Christmas bonuses which fail to meet the tests for exclusion from the regular rate of pay under FLSA Sec 7 will generally be found to be true bonuses. Production bonuses and labor saving bonuses present a more difficult problem. For investigation purposes, if the Inv finds that such additional payments periodically made are not merely devices for the postponement of the full payment to the employees of their ordinary wage or salary or devices for the perpetuation of an obsolete pay structure, he will be justified in concluding that the payments are true bonuses. In this event, such payments could be made as a percentage of total earnings or by the boosted hour method. Evidence that the payment is not being used for evasive purposes may be found in the fact that the wages otherwise paid to the employees are fair and not out of line with wages which might ordinarily be expected to be paid for the occupation in the locality. The determination should be based on the actual or potential operation of the bonus plan during a reasonably extended series for pay periods.</p></li>
<li><p>Many employers distribute bonuses on the basis of total straight time hours or earnings. If an investigation discloses that a bonus has been distributed in this manner and OT has been worked, the investigation will be handled as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If the bonus is of the type not directly related to hours worked, production or efficiency but which for some reason fails to qualify for exclusion from the regular rate under Sec 7(e), no request for back wages shall be made. In such cases the employer shall be informed of possible Sec 16(b) liability and of the steps necessary to effect compliance. The number of employees and the estimated amount of back wages shall not be shown on Form WH-51. The narrative shall contain a concise statement of the facts. Where an employee involved in such bonus payments is due back wages arising from other causes, the payment of such of other back wages will be requested and supervised.</p></li>
<li><p>If the bonus is a production bonus, a cost of living bonus or any other bonus directly related to hours worked, production or efficiency, OT violations will be recorded and the employer will be requested to pay the back wages.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of either (1) or (2) above, it must be kept in mind that the payments may be excludable under the provisions of FLSA Sec 7(g)(3) - Reg 548.</p></li>

<p>A total bonus may be distributed to each individual member sharing therein on a percentage basis by dividing the total payroll (both straight time and OT at time and one-half) of the participating employees into the total bonus.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Distribution of a total bonus may also take into account such factors as length of service, attendance lateness, production, efficiency, place of employment, job classifications, and the like. For example, the gross earnings of each participating employee may be weighted by multiplying them by a length of service factor such as 1.0 for one year, 1.1 for two years, 1.2 for three years, and so on. A total bonus can then be distributed on a percentage basis to each individual member sharing in the bonus by dividing the total weighted payroll of the participating employees into the total bonus. If each participating employee is then paid as his share this percentage of his total weighted earnings for the bonus period, the bonus mathematically will include both straight-time and OT and the payment will be in compliance with the FLSA and PCA. Such a bonus distribution may be based on more than one such factor by multiplying the gross earning of each employee by the additional factors and then determining each employee’s share as above.</p></li>
<li><p>The weighting of employees’ gross earnings to take into account length of service and similar factors is not invalid provided it is not designed to circumvent the OT requirements of the FLSA or PCA. It would, for example, be improper to apply a factor that decreases in inverse proportion to the OT worked by various groups of employees. A “group” to which a particular factor is to be applied may happen to include only one employee and still be valid. However, it should be clear that the dollar amount of the employee’s share of the total bonus has not been determined before establishment of the value of the length of service or other factor that is applied to his gross earnings. If the gross earnings of each of the participating employees is weighted by a factor of different value, there would be some evidence that the values of the factors had not been predetermined. In any instance where there is a question. the Inv shall discuss his findings with his FOS.</p></li>

<p>The fact that a collective bargaining or employment agreement does not specify the exact hours that are to constitute the workday does not preclude application of FLSA Sec 7(e)(7), nor is it necessary that the contract or agreement specifically provide for premium pay for hours “outside the workday”. If in practice the parties have arranged for payment of not less than time and one-half a bona fide rate for hours outside of a workday, the practice will be deemed to modify the terms of the original contract or agreement . For example, if a contract provides for payment of time and one-half for hours beyond 8 in a day or 40 in a week, but in practice the employees normally work from 8 a. m. to 5 p.m. with 1 hour for lunch, the payment of time and one-half for the hours before 8 a.m. and after 5 p.m. will be accepted as compliance with FLSA Sec 7(e)(7). Furthermore, where the scheduled hours of the workday vary from time to time because of unforeseen contingencies, this fact does not preclude the acceptance of such a workday as an established workday under Sec 7(e)(7). Where the above conditions are met, the OT premiums are valid under Sec 7(e)(7) regardless of the number of hours during the basic, normal workday or workweek.</p>

Whether or not the duties of employees necessitate irregular hours of work must be decided on the facts of employment as to such employees.</p></li>
<li><p>The following situations do not permit a finding that the employee’s hours are in fact irregular:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The fluctuation results entirely from absences of the employee for reasons other than the nature of his duties, such as absences due to illness, vacation, holidays, and the like.</p></li>

<li><p>The only fluctuation is minor or insignificant. The terms minor and insignificant shall be understood to mean fluctuations of 4 or less hours between the lowest number of hours worked and the highest number of hours worked in any year or where the fluctuations, even though beyond this range are only occasional.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>As a result of judicial decisions, the failure of the pay arrangement to meet the “excessivity” standard referred to in IB 778.408 and 778.410-.414 is no longer considered sufficient in itself to be a controlling criterion in testing the validity of a Sec 7(f) contract. In substance, the “excessivity” standard contemplated that the relationship between the hourly rate specified in the contract and the amount of the guaranty must be such that the employee would have worked or could reasonably have been expected to work sufficient hours to earn in excess of the guaranty in a significant number of weeks and thus demonstrate that the regular rate was designed to be operative in controlling the compensation. The weight to be given to a failure to meet this standard will depend on all the facts and the total situation. While the courts have declined to accept the view that validity of a pay arrangement under Sec 7(f) may be tested by this standard alone, the factors involved still may have evidential bearing, at least in conjunction with other pertinent considerations, on the bona fides of the contract. In situations where the fluctuations in weekly hours seem plainly unrelated to the guaranteed contract hours (for example, the employee’s hours ordinarily fluctuate between 35 and 45 or 50 but the contract guaranty covers 60 hours), the bona fides of the contract are subject to doubt . It is unlikely that under a bona fide contract an employer will pay week after week for more hours than actually worked.</p>

<li><p>In a week in which the employee worked 50 hours, the number of hours for which pay was guaranteed, his regular rate would be $220.00 divided by 50 hours, or $4.40. He would be entitled to receive an additional $22.00 for the 10 OT hours.</p></li>

His regular rate for that week would thus again be $4.40 and total compensation due would be ($220.00 + $22.00) + (5 X 1-1/2 X $4.40) or $275.00. BW due would be $275.00 - $250.00 or $25.00.</p></li>

<p>IB 778.418(a)(4) and 778.419(a) (3) provide that a piece rate or hourly rate will be regarded as a ‘bona fide” rate for OT purposes if it meets the MW requirements and is the rate “actually paid” for the particular kind of work during nonovertime hours. However, situations may arise where the particular kind of work for which the rate has been established is performed only during OT hours. In such cases, and if the MW requirement is met, the rate established for this work will be considered bona fide for OT purposes provided it is the rate which would be paid for the particular kind of work should it be performed during nonovertime hours. For example, a rate of $2 an hour (which is equal to or in excess of the rate normally paid) may be established for janitorial work in a welding shop under an arrangement whereby the work will be done by certain of the shop welders, whose welding rate is $3 an hour. (The prior understanding of the parties is that this different kind of work will be performed by the welders at the $2 rate and OT paid at 1½ the rate which is applicable to the work performed during OT hours.) If the circumstances are such that the welders perform the janitorial work only in their OT hour., the $2 rate shall be considered a bona fide rate for OT purposes provided it is the rate which would have been paid to the welders had they performed the janitorial work in nonovertime hours. The fact that the janitorial rate in this instance is 2/3 of the welding rate (thus making the time and one-half OT rate for janitorial work equal to the straight time rate for welding work) is not material so long as the janitorial rate is a bona fide rate.</p>

For example, during a limited period each year hourly-rated employees worked after regular hours on a special job for their employer. Under a clearly understood agreement with his/her employees, the employer, based on experience paid for this special job in a lump sum arrived at by computing time and one-half the regular rate for the estimated special job hours, and then adding an additional bonus amount.

<h4 id="j08-deductions-in-overtime-weeks."><strong>32j08 Deductions in overtime weeks.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>(FLSA Sec 7 (a) requires that an employee receive compensation for OT hours at “a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he/she is employed”. Where board, lodging, and facilities are charged to the employee and the employer recovers the amount by deductions from the employee’s cash wages, the regular rate is determined before the deductions are made. There is no limit to the amount which may be deducted for these items, provided that the deductions are confined to the reasonable cost of the board and lodging furnished. Where such deductions are in amounts which exceed the “reasonable cost”, the excess amount shall be handled the same as deductions for items other than “board, lodging, or other facilities”. The term “other facilities” means such items as meals furnished at company restaurants, housing furnished, general merchandise bought at company stores (including food, clothing, and household effects), and fuel, electricity, water, and gas furnished for the personal use of the employee.</p></li>
<li><p>Employers must pay statutorily-required MW and OT premium pay finally and unconditionally, or “free and clear.” The cost of furnishing items that are primarily for the benefit or convenience of the employer do not qualify as “facilities” under FLSA section 3(m); thus they may not be included as part of wages due. Further, deductions for articles that do not qualify as “board, lodging, or other facilities” under FLSA section 3(m), such as tools, equipment, cash register shortages, and other similar items, may not be made if they cut into required MW or OT premium pay. Deductions that reduce an employee’s average hourly earnings for the workweek after the deductions to less than the highest applicable MW rate are illegal in an OT week unless the law establishing that MW (e.g., State law, DBRA, SCA, H-2A, H-1B, H-2B, or a MSPA contracted “promised wage”) allows the particular deduction. (NOTE: If a MSPA contract specifically discloses that the employer will make certain particularized deductions not other prohibited by other law, those deductions would be permitted. For example, if a MSPA-covered employer disclosed a wage rate of $8.00/hour and fully disclosed in writing at the time of recruitment that $1.50/hour would be deducted for non-3(m) items, and the deductions are otherwise legal and not prohibited by other applicable laws, then those fully-disclosed deductions are permitted to reduce the hourly wage to below the $8.00/hour contracted “promised wage” (i.e. to $6.50/hour). Deductions for non-3(m) items may be made in an OT workweek to the same extent as permitted in a non-OT workweek if their purpose and effect are not to evade the OT requirements of the FLSA or other law, and if they are bona fide deductions made for particular items according to a prior agreement or understanding between the employer and the employee before the work is performed (Regs 531.37(a) and 778.315).</p></li>
<li><p>If an employer and an employee have an express or implied agreement about a deduction policy for particular items, then bona fide deductions pursuant to the policy will be allowed during an OT workweek to the extent that they would be allowed in a non-OT workweek, provided that the deductions do not violate other applicable laws (e.g., State law), the employee receives “free and clear” the highest applicable MW (including prevailing wages) required by any Federal, State or local law for the non-OT hours, and the employee receives time and one-half the regular rate of pay based on the stipulated wage, before any deductions are made, for all the OT hours. For example, if a forestry worker subject to a $9.00 per hour SCA prevailing WD is paid $10.00 per hour ($1.00 above the legally-required SCA WD rate of $9.00) and works 50 hours in a particular workweek, the most that may be deducted from this worker’s wages for that week pursuant to a prior agreement covering specific deductions (e.g. purchase of a saw) is 40 times $1.00 ($40.00). (Statutory wages due net after deductions = [40x$9.00 ($360.00 MW]+[(10 x 1.50 x $10.00 ($150.00 OT)] or $510.00 total MW &amp; OT.)</p></li>
<li><p>Unless there is an agreement as to deductions for particular items, or if the employer reduces an employee’s wages for a reason not addressed in the contractual arrangement or for no legitimate reason, the deductions will be considered illegal and will not be allowed during OT workweeks. To determine if these criteria are met, apply the following standards:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Deductions must be made for particular items according to an agreement or understanding between the parties: The agreement must be reached before the employee performs the work that becomes subject to the deductions. The agreement must be specific concerning the particular items for which the deductions will be made, and the employee must know how the amount of the deductions will be determined that are included in the agreement (e.g., cash register shortages). The employee must affirmatively agree or assent to the employer’s deduction policy. While the employee’s assent to the policy may be written or unwritten, the employer bears the burden of proof that an employee has agreed to the deduction policy.</p></li>
<li><p>Only bona fide deductions, made for particular items, are permitted: Deductions that are otherwise prohibited by other laws or authority (Federal, State or local) are not bona fide (e.g., if a State law prohibits any deductions from employees’ wages for tools and similar items or equipment that are business expenses of the employer, WH would not allow any deductions in that State in an OT workweek, regardless of whether the highest WH-enforced MW was paid (net) after the deductions). Deductions for amounts above the reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing a particular item to an employee are also not bona fide (e.g., furnishing items to employees “at a profit”; deductions for substandard housing). Deductions from wages where no prior agreement exists as to particular items are never permitted in an OT workweek.</p></li>
<li><p>The regular rate of pay is based on the stipulated wage before any deductions are made: Deductions for non-3(m) items that reduce an employee’s rate of pay to below the highest applicable legally-required MW are illegal unless the law establishing that MW allows the particular deductions. In OT workweeks (where OT requirements apply), deductions may be made according to an agreement that reduce the effective hourly rate down to the highest required MW, but only from the non-OT hours (first 40 hours in the week). Proper time and one-half the full regular rate (pre-deductions) must be paid for all statutory OT hours.</p></li>
<li><p>The purpose and effect of the deductions are not to evade the OT requirements or other laws: Deductions made only in OT workweeks, or increases in prices charged during OT workweeks compared to non-OT workweeks, will be considered manipulations to evade statutory OT requirements which are prohibited. Deductions that violate other applicable laws are prohibited in an OT workweek. (See Regs 531.37(a) and 778.315.)</p></li>

It is explained in this section of the IB that the parties may agree to exclude from hours worked those activities, such as eating meals between working hours, which would not be hours worked even if they were paid for pursuant to a contract, custom, or practice. Sec 778.320(b) states further that where “the parties have agreed to exclude such activities from hours worked, payments for such time will be regarded as qualifying for exclusion from the regular rate under the provisions of section 7(e)(2)” of the FLSA.</p></li>

However, if the correct OT compensation cannot be determined until sometime after the regular pay period, the requirements of the FLSA or the PCA will be satisfied if the employee is paid the excess OT compensation as soon after the regular payday as is practicable, but not later than the next payday after the computation can be made.

<p>A predetermined amount of work is regarded as a day’s work. Upon completion of this stint the employee is credited with 8 hours of work. The stint system is a piecework system. Instead of setting a price per number of units of work produced, as is done in most piecework systems, the number of hours allowed to complete a quantity of work is predetermined and paid for at the agreed hourly rate. Payment of one and one-half times the agreed hourly rate for stint work is equivalent to paying one and one-half times an established piecework rate. Payment of one and one-half times the agreed hourly rate for stint work or hourly rated work in excess of eight credited hours per day will comply with the FLSA overtime requirement and be in accordance with FLSA Section 7(g)(1) or (2), if the hours for which the overtime rate is paid qualify as overtime hours under FLSA Section 7(e)(5), (6), or (7).</p>

They pay one and one-half the agreed hourly rate for stint work or hourly rated work in excess of 40 credited hours. In this case there is no daily “stint” and no need to determine the employees’ “normal working hours” on a daily basis The sole question is whether the number of hours necessary to complete the weekly “stint” beyond which time and one-half is paid, is the employees’ “normal working hours” weekly (See FOH 32e01).

<h4 id="j16a-basic-requirements-to-be-considered."><strong>32j16a Basic requirements to be considered.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Two ways have been proposed by employers by which they may continue to pay their employees a constant wage or salary from pay period to pay period even though overtime is worked in some weeks. The first has been termed the time off plan and the second the prepayment plan. The time off plan, however, is inappropriate for employees who are compensated for overtime pursuant to FLSA Section 7(e)(7) or any of the subsections of FLSA section 7 (g).</p></li>
<li><p>Before explaining the operation of the time off and prepayment plans, certain basic requirements of the FLSA will be outlined which are material in determining the legality of any proposed plan. It must be remembered that the FLSA takes a single w/w as its standard and permits no averaging of hours over two or more weeks. Each week stands alone. Time and one-half OT compensation must be paid the employee for all hours which he works in a single w/w in excess of the applicable statutory maximum w/w. The pay period need not, however, coincide with the w/w. Thus, there is no objection if the pay period is biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly, but the amount of compensation due the employee at each pay period must be computed on the basis of a single w/w. It must also be remembered that OT compensation due an employee must be paid in cash and normally at the time of the regular pay period, that is, when the employee customarily receives his straight time compensation. It may not be accumulated to be paid at any time subsequent thereto.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="j16b-the-time-off-plan."><strong>32j16b The time off plan.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>To comply with the FLSA and to continue to pay a fixed wage or salary each pay period even though the employee works OT in some week or weeks within the pay period, the employer lays off the employee a sufficient number of hours during some other week or weeks of the pay period to offset the amount of OT worked so that the desired wage or salary for the pay period covers the total amount of compensation, including OT compensation, due the employee under the FLSA for each w/w taken separately. The plan may use a standard number of hours more or less than the applicable statutory maximum w/w. The employer does not pay for OT work in time off, nor does he average hours over a period longer than a week. Control of earnings by control of the number of hours an employee is permitted to work, not payment for OT in time off, is the essential principle of the time off plan. For this reason, a time off plan cannot be applied to a salaried employee who is paid a fixed salary to cover all hours he may work in any particular w/w or pay period.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="j16c-prepayment-plans."><strong>32j16c Prepayment plans.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Though OT compensation due an employee must normally be paid at the time of the employee’s regular pay period, there is no objection if the employer pays in advance OT compensation to become due to an employee. This is the basic principle of the prepayment plan. Thus some employers, in an attempt to keep the wage or salary constant from pay period to pay period, have resorted to paying their employees a sum in excess of what they earn or are entitled to in a particular week or weeks, which sum is considered to be a prepayment or advance payment of compensation for OT to be subsequently worked. In other words, the employer and the employee agree that in any week in which the employee works less than the applicable statutory maximum w/w the employer will advance to the employee the difference between the amount equal to his regular rate of pay for the applicable statutory maximum w/w and the amount he would have received if he had been paid only for the number of hours he worked. Bona fide plans of this type require the use of a record system whereby the employer can maintain a running account.</p></li>
<li><p>The question sometimes arises as to whether the loan or advance is really a loan or advance and not a salary arrangement. The determination of this question may depend upon what the parties understand will happen when an employee severs his/her relationship with the employer. If the employer still has some accumulated credits at that time, will some attempt be made to get back the amount of the loan or advance from the employee since there is no further possibility that it will be worked out by subsequent OT? The fact that no attempt will be made by the employer to collect the amount due him either by deducting such amount from the employee’s last check or by some other way is one indication that the loan or advance may simply be a fictitious bookkeeping device.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, the fact that at the end of the year, or at the end of some shorter period, credits accumulated by the employer are simply wiped out and a new start is made, is one indication that there may be no loan or advance in fact but simply a bookkeeping device. If there is no prepayment in fact and the plan is nothing but a bookkeeping device, the FLSA will have been violated.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an additional consideration with respect to the salaried employee who works a regular number of hours. If the employer, who contemplates adopting a prepayment plan, is required by an express or implied contract or agreement with the employee to pay him/her the fixed wage or salary, even when the employee works less than the regular number of hours in some week or weeks, it cannot be said that the employee is paid in excess of what he/she earns, or to which he/she is entitled, when he/she receives the fixed wage or salary in those weeks. He/she has received no loan or advance, and no amount therefore may be credited to the employer as a prepayment of compensation for OT to be subsequently worked.</p></li>
<li><p>For the same reason, a prepayment plan cannot be applied to a salaried employee who works a fluctuating number of hours. Since the nature of such an employee’s employment is that he will receive the fixed basic salary regardless of the number of hours worked, it cannot be said that such an employee is paid in excess of what he/she earns, or to which he/she is entitled, in any week in which he/she receives his/her fixed salary, even though such weeks may have been short weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>Only credits to the employer may be carried over beyond the pay period. Credits to the employee, that is, OT compensation due the employee, may not be carried over beyond the pay period to be consumed by subsequent employer advances, but must be paid in cash at the pay period. In this way the employer will never owe the employee OT compensation</p></li>
<li><p>Amounts paid to an employee while absent from work for a vacation, for holiday or sick leave, or for other miscellaneous periods of leave, may not be considered by the employer as prepaid OT compensation, just as the time off during such periods may not be used to balance OT worked within the pay period. Payment for idle holidays, vacations, etc., is not payment for OT and may not be considered by the employer as compensation for the employee’s OT work under the FLSA.</p></li>

<h4 id="j16d-comparison-of-the-time-off-and-prepayment-plans."><strong>32j16d Comparison of the time off and prepayment plans.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>In two respects a prepayment plan, if it may be properly applied to salaried employees, is not subject to the same restrictions as a time off plan. It is not confined, in its operations, to the pay period. Credits to the employer, that is, amounts paid by him/her in excess of the amounts earned by the employee or to which the employee is entitled, may be carried over beyond the pay period until they are consumed by the OT work of the employee. Secondly a prepayment plan may be applied to employees who are paid weekly.</p></li>
<li><p>Where applicable, a time off and prepayment plan may be applied together</p></li>
<li><p>These two plans are rarely used. When an Inv finds one in operation, he should communicate with his/her DD and obtain instructions as to how he/she should proceed.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Determining the Regular Rate for Tipped Employees </strong></p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The regular rate for a tipped employee is determined by dividing the total remuneration in any workweek, minus statutory exclusions, by the total hours worked. 29 CFR 531.60. The regular rate can never be less than the highest applicable minimum wage. 29 CFR 778.5.</p>
<p>An employer may claim a tip credit and also provide board, lodging, or other facilities. See 29 CFR part 531; FOH30c. The tip credit equals the difference between the minimum wage and the direct wage paid, which may be comprised of cash, board, lodging, and/or facilities, and must be at least $2.13 per hour. FOH30d06(b). In determining the regular rate for a tipped employee, all components of the employee’s wages must be considered (cash, board, lodging, facilities, tip credit). Tips in excess of the FLSA tip credit are not considered wages under Sec. 3(m) and are not considered in determining the regular rate. 29 CFR 531.60.</p>
<p>In determining the regular rate for a tipped employee, both the direct wage and the tip credit must be included. For example, if the employee is paid a direct wage of $2.13 and the employer claims a tip credit of $5.12, the regular rate will be $7.25 and the overtime rate will be $10.88 ($7.25 x 1.5). The direct wage payment in overtime hours would be $5.76 ($10.88 - $5.12); the overtime direct wage payment is not 1.5 x the non-overtime direct wage payment.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>An employee works 50 hours in a tipped occupation. The employer pays a cash wage of $2.13 per hour and claims a tip credit of $5.12. The employer complies with the requirements in 29 CFR 531.59(b) to inform its employees about the tip credit and the employee receives at least $5.12 per hour in tips.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>$7.25 regular rate ($2.13 cash wage + $5.12 tip credit)</p>
<p>50 x 7.25 = 362.50 (straight time)</p>
<p>10 x .5 x 7.25 = 36.25 (overtime premium)</p>
<p>$398.75 total wages due</p>
<p>50 x 5.12 = 256 tip credit</p>
<p>398.75 – 256 = 142.75 direct wage</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>An employee works 45 hours in a tipped occupation. The employer pays a cash wage of $3.00 per hour and claims a tip credit of $4.25.

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>$7.25 regular rate ($3.00 cash wage + $4.25 tip credit)</p>
<p>45 x 7.25 = 326.25 (straight time)</p>
<p>5 x .5 x 7.25 = 18.13 (overtime premium)</p>
<p>$ 344.38 total wages due</p>
<p>45 x 4.25 = 191.25 tip credit</p>

</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><strong>Deductions </strong></p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When an employer claims a tip credit, the tipped employee is considered to have been paid only the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage for all non-overtime hours worked in a tipped occupation. See FOH 30d06. An employer that claims a tip credit therefore may not make deductions in a workweek of 40 hours or less for non-3(m) costs such as shortages, breakage, cost of uniforms, etc., because any such deduction would reduce the tipped employee’s wages below the minimum wage. Updating Regulations Issued Under the Fair Labor Standards Act; Final Rule, 76 FR 18839, April 5, 2011; 29 CFR 531.36. Because non-3(m) deductions cannot be made in a workweek of 40 hours or less when the tip credit is claimed, employers are also prohibited from taking such deductions in overtime weeks, even when the regular rate is higher than the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage (for example, when a higher state minimum wage is the regular rate). See 29 CFR 531.37. When an employer claims a tip credit, deductions for non-3(m) items, therefore, cannot be valid in an overtime workweek, because deductions not permitted in non-overtime workweeks are also prohibited in overtime workweeks.  See 32j08(b).</p>
<p>An employer may only make non-3(m) deductions from the wages of a tipped employee when no tip credit is claimed and the direct or cash wage paid is greater than the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><strong>Regular Rate in Excess of FLSA MW</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When Federal, state or local laws require an employer to pay a higher minimum wage than required by FLSA, or if the wage set through established practice, agreement, or understanding is greater than the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage, FLSA overtime provisions require that the employee receive the regular rate for all hours worked before overtime is calculated. Where an employer claims a tip credit under Sec. 3(m), straight time wages paid to the employee are capped at the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage. See FOH30d00. Consequently, where the regular rate exceeds the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage, before additional half time for overtime is computed, the rate paid to the tipped employee in overtime weeks must be raised to the regular rate. The employer therefore owes the difference between the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage and the regular rate in cash for all hours worked as a tipped employee.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Questions regarding the proper calculation of overtime pay often arise in situations where state or local laws require an employer to pay a higher minimum wage than required by the FLSA and permit the employer to claim a higher tip credit than permitted under the FLSA.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, assume the state minimum wage is $7.50 and that the state law requires a cash wage of $2.13 per hour and allows the employer to take a tip credit of $5.37 per hour. Assuming all hours worked during the week were at the state minimum wage rate, the employee’s regular rate is the state minimum wage rate ($7.50) but the employer is limited to a tip credit of $5.12 under the FLSA ($7.25 – $2.13). See 29 CFR 778.5. The employer must make up the difference between the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage and the regular rate in cash before calculating the additional half time due. See FOH32j02.</p>

<p>Where an employee works more than eight hours a day in order to make up time lost for any reason other than tardiness, such as time lost because of a holiday, he/she must be paid time and one-half his/her basic rate, even though the employee requested the arrangement or acquiesced in it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secs 7(b)(1) and 7(b)(2) provide partial OT exemptions for employees employed “. . . in pursuance of an agreement made as a result of collective bargaining by representatives of employees certified as bona fide by the National Labor Relations Board . . .” under the stated conditions . The NLRB concludes it has authority to process petitions from labor organizations of government employees seeking certification as “bona fide” for purposes of Secs 7(b)(1) and 7(b)(2) of the FLSA. Consequently, if the tests for exemption under Sec 7(b)(1) and 7(b)(2) are met and the union receives such certification by the NLRB, the government employees covered under the “agreement” may qualify for such exemption.</p>
