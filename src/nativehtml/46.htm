<h2>Chapter 46 - ENFORCEMENT OF H-2B</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>46a - GENERAL </h3>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<h4>46a00 - Purpose. </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>The H-2B provisions of the Immigration and
Nationality Act (INA) provide for the admission of nonimmigrants to the United
States to perform temporary non-agricultural labor or services. See 8 USC §
1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b). This chapter provides information on regulations and
interpretations with respect to the Wage and Hour Division’s (WHD) enforcement authority
under the H-2B nonimmigrant program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>46a01 - H-2B petition process.  </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ETA. The H-2B
petition process begins when the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) certifies
that the prospective H-2B employer performed the required recruitment and was
unable to obtain sufficient numbers of qualified U.S. workers to meet its
temporary employment need. The ETA certifying officer (CO) reviews the complete
Application for Temporary Employment Certification ETA Form 9142 and Appendix B.1
and makes a determination to certify or deny the application. ETA may issue a
Request for Further Information (RFI) to, or at its discretion conduct an audit
of, the employer if ETA believes the employer has not established its need or
met its domestic recruitment obligations. Included within ETA jurisdiction are
determinations related to such issues as justification and appropriate classification
of the temporary need, availability of U.S. workers, positive recruitment,
prevailing wage determinations, methodology for establishing the prevailing
wage, and similar matters.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>DHS/USCIS. After
obtaining a certified Application from ETA the employer then submits a petition
to Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
(USCIS). USCIS reviews the petition which includes the certified Application
for Temporary Employment Certification and the DHS Form I-129, Petition for a
Nonimmigrant Worker.  USCIS either approves or denies the petition.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>DOS. After the
employer has an adjudicated petition from the USCIS, the Department of State
(DOS) issues the visa to the H-2B workers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>46a02 - Enforcement authority.</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>Effective January 18, 2009, WHD was delegated
enforcement authority from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under INA
§ 214(c)(14)(A). This includes authority to impose administrative remedies on
an employer who substantially fails to meet any of the conditions of the
petition to admit or provide status to an H-2B worker or who willfully
misrepresents a material fact on such petition. The regulations for this
program are in 20 CFR Part 655 Subpart A. Questions or complaints concerning
the H-2B program should be directed to the nearest Wage and Hour Division
District Office. See http://www.dol.gov/whd/america2.htm. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>On February 21, 2012, the Department issued new Final
Rule for the H-2B program.  77 FR 10038.  On April 26, 2012, the Final Rule was
preliminarily enjoined by the court in Bayou Lawn &amp; Landscape Servs. v.
Solis, No. 3:12-cv-00183-MC-CJK, slip op. (N.D. Fla. Apr. 26, 2012), appeal
docketed, No. 12-12462 (11th Cir. May 15, 2012).  The 2008 H-2B regulations
were not at issue and are not affected by the district court's preliminary
decision in Bayou Lawn.  Rather, as the district court explained, its
preliminary injunction had the effect of &quot;preserving the status quo&quot;
of the 2008 rules.  Bayou Lawn, Slip. Op. at 7.  This FOH Chapter relates to
the 2008 rules only.   </p>

Davis Bacon Act (DBA), the Service Contract Act (SCA), and any other program
enforced by the WHD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>46a04 - Territory of Guam. </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.25in'>The Department of Labor
(DOL) does not certify to USCIS the temporary employment of H‑2B workers, or
enforce compliance with the provisions of the H-2B visa program, in the
Territory of Guam. The administration of the H-2B temporary labor certification
program is performed by the Governor of Guam, or the Governor's designated
representative.  See 20 CFR 655.2 and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(iii-v)</p>

the portion of time beyond 12 months. See 20 CFR 655.20(f).</p>

obligations. Prior to filing the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification, an employer must perform all necessary steps of the recruitment

The H-2B employer first must obtain a prevailing wage determination (PWD) from
ETA by submitting an ETA Form 9141, Application for Prevailing Wage
Determination. Prevailing wage requests are handled by the ETA National Processing
Center (NPC). Information concerning PWDs may be found at http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/contacts.cfm.
See 20 CFR 655.10.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>The NPC will enter the
prevailing wage on the form, indicate the source and validity period, and
return the certified prevailing wage (electronically or by mail) to the employer.
The employer must offer this wage (or higher) to both its H‑2B workers and any
similarly employed U.S. workers hired in response to the recruitment required

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>“Deduction”
means any amount by which the H-2B worker’s cash wages are decreased. A
deduction may be shown on the payroll records, marked as a deduction or a wage
credit (e.g., FICA, housing). However, a deduction will also be considered to
exist where the H-2B worker’s cash wages have been decreased through
out-of-pocket expenditures made by the H-2B worker for business expenses of the
H-2B employer incurred in obtaining the worker's H-2B status. Such expenses
include:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'><span>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The H-2B
regulations allow employers to receive reimbursement for certain specific
costs, including government required passport and visa fees. Under the FLSA,
visa fees are an employer business expense. Consequently, H-2B employers that
are covered under the FLSA may not make deductions that would bring the
employee below the FLSA minimum wage. See 20 CFR 655.22(g), see also Field
Assistance Bulletin 2009-2 available at:  http://www.dol.gov/whd/FieldBulletins/FieldAssistanceBulletin2009_2.htm</p>

Wage.  Under the FLSA, the employer is liable for the inbound transportation of
the H-2B worker and the outbound transportation when the worker's H-2B status
has ended. If failure to pay such transportation costs results in a failure to
pay the FLSA minimum wage in a non-overtime initial or terminal workweek or the
regular rate in an overtime workweek, there is an FLSA wage violation for the
affected initial or terminal workweek(s). See Field Assistance Bulletin 2009-2.</p>

(OT) Pay. Where the FLSA OT requirement is applicable, the 40-hour workweek/time-and-one-half
standard will be used to determine whether the worker has been properly paid. Premium
pay is based on the H-2B employee's regular rate of pay, which can be no less
than the required/offered wage.</p>
