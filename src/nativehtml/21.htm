<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>IB 779.309 through
779.311 sets forth the principles to be followed in determining whether an
employee who is employed in the work of more than one establishment of his
employer in the same w/w is “employed by” a retail or service establishment for
purposes of exemption. The principles may be further illustrated in the case of
a tailor, who may make alterations upon clothing in one retail establishment
which was sold in another of his employer’s retail establishments. In such
cases the tailor at any given time during the week is actually performing
alterations which are incidental to the specific retail sales of a particular
retail establishment and is engaged in the work of such exempt establishment
itself and thus is “employed by” the establishment while so engaged. An
employee would not, therefore, be disqualified for exemption in any w/w when he
is “employed by” an exempt retail establishment at all time during the w/w even
though not “employed by” the same exempt establishment for the entire week.

grind coffee; a drug store may prepare prescriptions; a restaurant may process

applicability of the exemption. For example, the recapping of a tire for a
customer, the upholstering of a chair for a customer, the repairing of an
automobile for a customer regardless of the degree of repairs, the rebuilding
of a pair of shoes for a customer, or the rebuilding of a typewriter for a
customer, are regarded as the performance of services for purposes of the
application of the retail or service establishment exemptions. Where, however,
the job would result in the creation of a different product from that which the
customer brought in such as, for example, where a truck or a bus is made out of
the customer’s automobile, or where a suit of clothes is made out of a piece of
cloth the customer brought in, the activity of making the truck, the bus, or
the suit of clothes is a manufacturing activity and employees engaged in such

establishment within the meaning of the Act is one which is open and available
to the general public, with which it has direct dealings, either in person or
by telephone or by mail. (See IB 779.319.) An establishment which merely
distributes goods to outside salesmen (or door-to-door canvassers), or merely
delivers goods sold by such outside salesmen, does not qualify as a retail or
service establishment even though, on occasion, it may make some retail sales
on the premises.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The fact that an establishment
is located on an instrumentality or facility of commerce, including government
installations, does not of itself preclude the possible applicability of a
retail or service establishment exemption. It is possible under certain

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Some independently owned and operated vending machine
companies install, control, service, and supply with merchandise their vending
machines located in plants, buildings, transportation terminals, and the like.
Such vending machine installations operate and function independently of the
plant or building in which they are located, under a lessor-lessee arrangement.
Typically, the machines are installed in groups or banks, in some cases
together with tables and/or benches. There may be several groups of these
machines in one building. Employees called “matrons” or “hostesses” are
assigned to keep the machines filled, offer assistance to customers, make
change, maintain the area and generally see to the operation of the machines;
“inside routemen” may be assigned to stock these machines. In such cases where
the machines are independently owned and operated by the vending machine firm
and are attended by its employees, it is the position of Wage and Hour that
each group or bank of machines may constitute a separate and distinct
establishment; in some cases those vending locations (perhaps one or more
groups) which are located in the same building can be considered a single
establishment if operated as such. Since sales through vending machines are
considered retail, the employees employed at these locations may qualify for
exemption under Sec 13(a)(2) if the tests are met. Sec 13(b)(8) may also apply
since the food stations will qualify as restaurants. Similarly, an employee who
services two or more groups of machines may qualify for exemption per FOH 21a06
as he or she is considered engaged in retail activities and not central office
functions.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>In many cases the groups or banks of machines as
described in (a) above are controlled by a central office and/or commissary
kitchen or warehouse located off the premises which purchases merchandise,
prepares food and performs accounting, clerical, and related duties. These
central offices, etc., do not qualify as retail establishments and employees
employed by the firm at such locations are not exempt.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>In some cases, usually in larger plants, the vending
machine company may operate an office located on the premises to supervise all
operations of the firm in the particular plant. Such an office may include a
storage area for merchandise for the machines. The storage area and office
serve only the food banks located at the particular plant. The employees
employed by the firm work exclusively at this location and the office keeps its
own records and orders it own supplies. Hostesses and routemen are employed by
this office to service the machines located at various points in the plant. In
such a case the firm is operating a business possessing unity of ownership,
unity of operations, unity of function, and though consisting of separate
“stations” or “food banks” the business at the location is consolidated and
operated as a functionally integrated unit. Where a business with such
characteristics is located in one plant, factory, or building and serves no
outside establishments, the parts of such a business, including the office,
storage area, and food banks will be considered one single establishment for
purposes of exemption. As such, Secs 13(a)(2) and 13(b)(8) may apply if the
tests are met.</span></p>

<h3>21b - ESTABLISHMENT DETERMINATIONS<span><br>

<h4>21b00 - Establishment--single concession.</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A concession such as
one in a ball park which supplies its stands and hawkers with hot dogs,
popcorn, and the like from one central commissary is a single establishment for
the purposes of the retail and service establishment exemptions. The business
possesses unity of ownership, unity of operations, unity of functions, and
though broken into units known as stands, is consolidated and operated as an integrated
unit. The stands and the vendors do not have independent characters of their
own as establishments, for they are on a temporary relationship to the
commissary and fulfill the functions of departments for an establishment. Only
together with the commissary can they constitute a definable establishment.
Thus, unlike a commissary serving a chain of retail stands operated in a
transportation terminal or similar area, the concession commissary does not in
essence perform a warehouse function for a group of establishments within the
meaning of the FLSA, but is rather fundamentally a necessary complement to an
integrated retail establishment. This business operates on the same premises of
the ball park stadium, and no other establishments separate the parts of the
business.</span></p>

<h4>21b01 - Establishment-multiple concessions.</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The fact that the
firm’s concessions are “under one roof”, as in the case of a firm which leases
space at an airport terminal building, a railway station, or similar restricted
area, does not of itself create a “single establishment”. (Nor is this
situation comparable to that involving the operation of leased departments
within the meaning of IB 779.225 or 779.306.) A determination as to whether the
operations constitute one or more than one establishment must be made. Among
the factors to be taken into consideration are the relative physical location
of the units, the degree of segregation along functional lines, whether or not
there is a common supervisory staff, the amount of employee interchange, and
the extent to which separate sales or other records are kept. If it is found
the operations constitute more than one establishment, each individual
establishment must meet the tests for exemption. With respect to employees who
perform work for more than one of the establishments see FOH 21a06.</span></p>

portable crane to take a boat out of the water but this does not transform the

change in the nature of its customers, that it now only services small boats
and that its railway is no longer in use. Thus, the facilities of an
establishment are important but not necessarily conclusive as to its status.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>With respect to the
first test contained in Sec 3(n) it is clear that sales of materials to
contractors for use in the construction, repair, or maintenance of apartment
houses, motels, churches, schools or other commercial or industrial structures
are sales for resale. Such structures are not “residential” buildings of the
type contemplated by Sec 3(n).</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>With respect to the second test of Sec 3(n), in
determining whether sales of lumber and building materials are recognized as
bona fide retail sales in the industry, it is necessary first to test such
sales under the lumber and building materials determination. If they are not
recognized as retail under the principles set forth in the determination, they
will not meet the second test of Sec 3(n). It does not follow, however, that
all sales recognized in the determination as retail are recognized as bona fide
retail sales for purposes of Sec 3(n). Thus, although the determination, among
other things, recognizes sales in other than direct carload lots as retail sales
(see IB 779.355(b)(3)), regard must be given to the legislative history and
Wage-Hour’s position that sales of lumber to a contractor to build a whole
residential subdivision are not recognized as bona fide retail sales under Sec
3(n) (see IB 779.335). There may, therefore, be certain circumstances under
which sales in other than direct carload lots are not recognized as bona fide
retail sales within the meaning of Sec 3(n). For example, some contractors
engaged in the building of subdivisions may build only a few houses at a given
time, and possibly purchase materials in lot quantities sufficient to construct
only one house at a given time. Where such lumber sales are made pursuant to a
contract, agreement or understanding that the dealer is to supply the
contractor with all his lumber requirements for a subdivision consisting of a
fixed or indefinite number of houses such sales would not be recognized as
retail regardless of whether the lumber is to be delivered in small quantities
as construction progresses or all at one time (see IB 779.328(c)).
Consequently, such sales would not qualify for exclusion from the category of
sales for resale under Sec 3(n).</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Situations may be encountered where a contractor is
engaged in building a number of houses on scattered lots and is purchasing the

materials contemplated for delivery pursuant to a direct or indirect contract,
agreement or understanding between the dealer and the contractor is materially
in excess of the total quantity of goods which might reasonably be purchased by
a member of the general consuming public during the same period, under Sec 3(n)
such sales would not be recognized as bona fide retail sales. Of course, in
those instances where a contractor is purchasing materials to build a single
house only, whether or not in behalf of the home owner, such a sale may be
recognized as being a bona fide retail sale within the meaning of Sec 3(n).</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>In some cases burial insurance policies provide that
the insurance company itself will provide funeral services within the limits of
the policy. Where such services (including furnishing a casket, etc.) are
performed by a mortuary under agreement or contract with the insurance company,
the mortuary is considered to be selling its services to the insurance company.
The policyholder’s right to the services arises out of a collateral contractual
agreement with the insurance company and not from any agreement between the
policyholder and the mortuary. In computing the ADV of the mortuary which
provides funeral services under a burial insurance policy not sold by the
mortuary itself, only the actual amount of reimbursement (for services and
merchandise) received from the insuring company, rather than the face value of
the policy, will be counted. Sales for such services through an agreement with
an insuring company are “sales for resale” for purposes of Sec 13(a)(2). For
example, a burial policy with a face value of $600 provides actual funeral
services of only $410; the remaining $190 goes to the insurer. The $410
reimbursement is counted in measuring the ADV of the mortuary and is a “sale
for resale”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>On the other hand if
the burial insurance policy provides for paying certain funeral expenses to or
in behalf of policy holders, the fact that payment may be made directly to the
mortuary by the insurance company does not make the sales of such services
sales for resale. This is analogous to a garage performing repair services on
damaged automobiles and being paid directly by the insurance company. (See FOH
21ca04.)</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>In making sales of funeral services, some mortuaries
have listings (catalogs) of various types of monuments for sale by monument
companies which they show to their customers. In some cases, mortuary employees
may “show” monuments purchased by other customers. The mortuary takes orders
which are sent to monument companies, with the customers paying either the
funeral home or the monument company. For its services the mortuary receives a
commission based on a percentage of the sales price. In such situations
employees of the mortuary are engaged in “selling” the monuments to its
customers and consequently the total price of the monuments and not merely the
commissions received must be counted in computing the AGV of sales. Such sales
are retail (see IB 779.363). These same principles will also apply where a
mortuary sells memorials or flowers in a similar manner.</span></p>

the ADV of sales made or business done for purposes of Sec 3(s). On the other
hand, if interest is charged, it (i.e., the interest) would be included in the
AGV of the enterprise and would be considered nonretail for purposes of Sec
13(a)(2).</span></p>

business arrangements or understandings (as discussed in IB 779.328(c)) whereby
particular sales, although involving relatively small quantities, are discounted

generally result in purchases over a given time which materially exceed
purchases made by a typical member of the general consuming public to fill his

departmentalized, providing service station facilities designed for highway
carriers. In addition to fueling facilities for trucks and buses, it may
include food service facilities, sleeping quarters for truckers, and a compound
where trucks are parked and serviced. It is characterized by long approaches
and exits, and wide spaces between fuel pumps which make services more
convenient for large trucks. A truck stop carries gasoline, diesel fuel,
various parts and accessories and often has ice available for re-icing of cargo
trucks. Limited truck repair service is usually available. Those providing
maintenance service have specialized equipment, such as oversized tire
equipment, designed especially for truck servicing. The primary source of
revenue is generally the sale of diesel fuel which is used almost exclusively
by large trucks, heavy tractors, buses, and construction equipment. A high
percentage of the sales of truck stops are made to the trucking industry, not
the general public.</span></p>

(c)(3) above) has reference to the indiscriminate use of employees in both
units. This requirement is met where the interchange is only occasional (see IB
779.305). Interchange typically refers to employees who physically work in both
units. Thus, the no-interchange test is not met where a cashier regularly works
in the food service facility at meal times and in the other portions of the
truck stop at other times. On the other hand, where a bookkeeper is located in
one unit but works on the payroll records of both the food service facility and
the other portions of the truck stop, this activity would not in itself defeat
the requirement that there be no interchange of employees.</span></p>

separate restaurant establishment under the standards listed above, employees
of the restaurant who also perform work for the non-exempt establishment during
the same w/w are not “employed by” a restaurant during such w/w (cf. IB 779.311(a)).
Thus, a bookkeeper who maintains records for both units is not within the
restaurant exemption. On the other hand, employees of a separate restaurant
establishment who irregularly perform an insignificant amount of incidental
work for the non-exempt unit are within the exemption.</span></p>

rather than be restricted to a particular group.</span></p>

typically as contractors who bid on the demolition of particular buildings. In

wrecking of buildings are generally recognized as part of the construction

demolition contractor operates as a construction contractor, ordinarily
figuring his profit on the contracts for demolition jobs rather than on markups
of goods procured and kept in stock for sale to customers. For these reasons,
employees engaged in such wrecking activities are not employed “by” a retail or

encountered where the test is not clearly met and specific determinations of the
regular rate for particular weeks are required. This will present no difficulty
in the ordinary case. However, if the employee is paid commissions under a pay
plan involving balancing factors, complex problems as to the regular rate are
raised. For example, a guarantee plan may operate on a formula basis which
reflects the cumulative effect of the employee’s sales work with the
understanding that additional payments will be made when the amount due from
commissions over the period exceeds the total compensation previously paid. Or,
the guarantee plan may include a provision that if commissions allocable to a
particular w/w fail short of the guarantee the amount of the insufficiency will
be carried forward as a “deficit” and deducted from an “overage” in some future

only 7, 8 or 9 hours a day and still receive credit for 10, 11 or 12, etc.,
flat rate hours depending upon how much work he or she has done. Each job is assigned
a certain number of hours for which the customer is charged, regardless of the
actual time it takes to perform the job. The employee is given a certain
proportion of that charge expressed in terms of so many dollars and cents per
“flat rate” hour rather than in terms of a percentage of the charge to the
customer. The dealer does not change the employee’s share per flat rate hour if
the charge to the customer is changed. In such situations Wage-Hour will not
deny that such payments represent “commissions on goods or services” for

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A “custodial” employee
is one who guards and protects or maintains the premises of the hotel or motel
facility in which he is employed. This includes an employee who performs
janitorial functions, who keeps the facility clean, who tends the heating
system, makes minor repairs, and the like. It includes housemen and gardeners.
It also includes employees of the facility engaged in activities incidental to
the operation of the hotel or motel, such as maids and custodial employees in
the facility’s beauty or barber shops, valet, restaurant, and the like. It
includes employees engaged in laundering, cleaning, or repairing clothing or
fabrics of guests. OT protection is thus afforded to those who have duties such
as laying carpets and rugs and arranging furniture, and to those who have
duties such as making beds, dusting furniture, and replenishing linen.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt'>A question has been raised concerning the
applicability to employees of a country club’s dining room of the Sec 13(b)(8)
exemption for “any employee employed by an establishment which is a . . .
restaurant”. Wage-Hour will consider this exemption applicable to employees of
a private club who are engaged in preparing or serving food or beverages on its
premises to its members and guests. Typical of the employees within the
exemption are cooks and kitchen service employees, bus boys, waiter and
waitresses, bartenders, snack bar attendants, and other similar employees
engaged in the preparation and serving of food or beverages on club premises.
In other words, the employees engaged in a club’s food and beverage service
could qualify as employees “employed by an establishment which is a restaurant”
even though their work may take them into other areas of the club premises.
Thus, the food and beverage employees may provide service, for example, to
members and guest at poolside, in the locker rooms, on terraces, on the lawn,
in cardrooms or in other recreation areas without loss of the exemption.</span></p>

club’s food and beverage service employees has the effect of a general
determination, applicable only to such clubs, that the employees described will
be considered to qualify under Sec 13(b)(8) as “employed by an establishment
which is a . . .  restaurant”. This means that we will not, in individual
cases, question whether they are “employed by” an identifiable separate establishment
on the premises which is a “restaurant”. The exemption does not apply to other
service employees, such as those who maintain the tennis courts, the swimming
pool, or who attend to the general running of the club even though such
employees may work in the same areas as the food and beverage service
employees.</span></p>

membership restrictions and may offer such restaurant service to members and
guests are country, town, swimming pool, tennis, golf, ski, and beach clubs,

Custodial services include mopping the kitchen floor, vacuuming the dining room

lose the Sec 13(b)(8) exemption if they perform any custodial services in the
w/w not directly related to maintaining the dining and kitchen premises, such
as cleaning guest rooms or cleaning the hotel lobby. Kitchen and dining room
employees (including banquet workers) are not performing “custodial services”
when they wash dishes, clean tables, carry out dishes and set tables. Thus,
time spent by hotel and motel waitresses, bus boys, and banquet workers in such

style='font-size:12.0pt'>General guidance in defining “restaurant” is contained
in IB 779.387. A “restaurant” may be further identified as an establishment
engaged in serving prepared food and beverages selected by the patron from a
full menu. Waiter or waitress service is usually provided (except in some
cafeterias) and the establishment has dining (seating) facilities and
equipment. Thus, establishments known as cafes, cafeterias, coffee shops,
diners, dining rooms, lunchrooms, tea rooms, etc., may qualify as
“restaurants”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-size:
12.0pt'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>There are many types of retail establishments that
sell prepared food or beverages for consumption on the premises or for
immediate consumption that are clearly not “restaurants”, such as drinking
places, social caterers, and ice cream and frozen custard stands. This
distinction is not so readily apparent with respect to establishments, such as
quick-service food establishments, primarily engaged in selling limited lines
of refreshments and prepared food items, such as hamburgers, fried and
barbecued chicken, pizza, etc., for consumption on or near the premises or for
“take-home” consumption. Such establishments range from “carryouts”, which have
no seating facilities and cannot qualify as “restaurants”, to establishments
that have tables and booths, parking for eating in one’s car, and “take-home”
containers. Whether a quick-service food establishment is a “restaurant”
pursuant to Sec 13(b)(8) depends on the facts in a particular situation. Such
quick-service food establishments that do not provide the characteristic
employee services and the physical and functional equipment and furnishings
that patrons require for consumption of meals on the premises are not
“restaurants” for purposes of Sec 13(b)(8). On the other hand, where a
particular quick-service food establishment does provide the customary employee
and dining room services, pursuant to the above and IB 779.387, WH will not
deny the exemption. As in cafeterias, the fact that waiters and waitresses may
not be employed would not alter this position. The present examples in IB
779.387 of “refreshment stands” and “lunch counters” should be interpreted in
the light of and consistent with the discussion above.</span></p>
