Medical Leave Act (FMLA, or the&nbsp;Act), Public Law 103-3, 107 Stat.&nbsp;6
(29&nbsp;USC.&nbsp;2601 et seq.), was enacted on February 5, 1993, and became
effective for most covered employers on August 5, 1993.  The FMLA is intended
to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote
the stability and economic security of families, and to promote national
interests in preserving family integrity.  The Act is intended to accomplish
these purposes in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of
employers, and that is consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.</span></p>

employment situations, only the primary employer is responsible for giving
required notices to its employees, providing FMLA leave, and maintaining health
benefits. Factors considered in determining which is the primary employer
include authority/responsibility to hire and fire, assign/place the employee,
make payroll, and provide employment benefits.  The primary employer is
responsible for job restoration and the secondary employer is responsible for
accepting the employee returning from leave.  For example, if the joint
employment relationship is that of temporary/leased employee and the secondary
employer continued to use the agency to fill the position, the employee is
entitled to return to the position he or she held with the secondary employer. 
If the secondary employer did not fill the position from that agency, then the
primary employer must place the employee in an equivalent position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.25in'><span>An employee’s
worksite is ordinarily the site the employee reports to, or from which the
employee’s work is assigned.  A worksite can refer to a simple location, a
group of buildings, such as a campus or industrial park, or to separate
facilities in geographic proximity to one another.  The 75 miles are measured
from the employee’s worksite by surface miles using surface transportation over
public streets, roads, highways and waterways by the shortest route possible.  If
surface transportation is not available between worksites, the distance is
measured by the most frequently used mode of transportation.</span></p>

fixed worksite, such as in the case for many construction workers,
transportation workers, and salespersons, the site to which they report, from
which their work is assigned, or the location to which they are assigned as
their home base, is their worksite.  An employee’s personal residence is not a
worksite.  In the case of employees who work from home under “telework” or
“flexi place arrangements” or others such as salespersons who may leave to work
from home and return to their residence, their worksite is the office to which
they report or from which their assignments are made.  If 50 employees are
employed within 75 miles from the employee’s official worksite, the employee meets
the requirements for that test, regardless of where the employee is currently
performing his or her duties.</span></p>

if an employer does not count vacation leave against an attendance bonus but
does count unpaid leave against the bonus, the employer may deny the bonus to
an employee who takes 12 weeks of FMLA leave, two weeks of which the employee

cannot use the taking of leave as a negative factor in employment actions, such
as hiring, promotions, or discipline.  Leave taken for any FMLA-qualifying
reason may not be assessed points or counted against an employee in any manner under
employer “no fault” attendance plans.</span></p>

violations of the FMLA or its regulations constitute interfering with the
rights provided by the FMLA.  An employer may be liable for compensation and
benefits lost by because of the violation, for other actual monetary losses
sustained as a direct result of the violation, and for equitable or other
relief based upon the harm suffered.</span></p>

cannot waive, or be induced by employers to waive, their future rights under
the FMLA.  For example, employees (individually or through a collective
bargaining agreement (CBA)) cannot trade the right to take FMLA leave for some
other benefit offered by the employer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span>(1)<span

does not prevent the settlement or release of FMLA claims by employees based on
past employer conduct.  Such a settlement does not require approval of the
Department of Labor or a court.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span>This also does
not prevent an employee’s voluntary and uncoerced acceptance of a light duty
assignment while recovering from a serious health condition.  Such an
acceptance cannot be a condition of employment and does not constitute a waiver
of the employee’s future rights, including the right to be restored to the same
or equivalent position the employee held when the employee’s FMLA leave began. 
However, the employee’s right to restoration ceases at the end of the
applicable 12-month FMLA leave year.  See FOH 39j07.</span></p>

provision in the FMLA will diminish any protection or greater benefit provided
by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA).  On the other hand, no provision of
the FMLA can be diminished by any provision of a CBA.</span></p>
