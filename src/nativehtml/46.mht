<h2>Chapter 46 - ENFORCEMENT OF H-2B</h2>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>46a - GENERAL </h3>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<h4>46a00 - Purpose. </h4>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=3DMsoListParagraph>The H-2B provisions of the Immigration and
Nationality Act (INA) provide for the admission of nonimmigrants to the Uni=
ted
States to perform temporary non-agricultural labor or services. See 8 USC ¤
1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b). This chapter provides information on regulations and
interpretations with respect to the Wage and Hour DivisionÕs (WHD) enforcem=
ent authority
under the H-2B nonimmigrant program.</p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>46a01 - H-2B petition process. &nbsp;</h4>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=3DMsoListParagraph style=3D'text-indent:-.25in'><span>(a)<span
style=3D'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ETA. The =
H-2B
petition process begins when the Employment and Training Administration (ET=
A) certifies
that the prospective H-2B employer performed the required recruitment and w=
as
unable to obtain sufficient numbers of qualified U.S. workers to meet its
temporary employment need. The ETA certifying officer (CO) reviews the comp=
lete
Application for Temporary Employment Certification ETA Form 9142 and Append=
ix B.1
and makes a determination to certify or deny the application. ETA may issue=
 a
Request for Further Information (RFI) to, or at its discretion conduct an a=
udit
of, the employer if ETA believes the employer has not established its need =
or
met its domestic recruitment obligations. Included within ETA jurisdiction =
are
determinations related to such issues as justification and appropriate clas=
sification
of the temporary need, availability of U.S. workers, positive recruitment,
prevailing wage determinations, methodology for establishing the prevailing
wage, and similar matters.</p>

<p class=3DMsoListParagraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=3DMsoListParagraph style=3D'text-indent:-.25in'><span>(b)<span
style=3D'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>DHS/USCIS=
. After
obtaining a certified Application from ETA the employer then submits a peti=
tion
to Department of Homeland SecurityÕs U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servi=
ces
(USCIS). USCIS reviews the petition which includes the certified Application
for Temporary Employment Certification and the DHS Form I-129, Petition for=
 a
Nonimmigrant Worker.&nbsp; USCIS either approves or denies the petition.</p>

<p class=3DMsoListParagraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=3DMsoListParagraph style=3D'text-indent:-.25in'><span>(c)<span
style=3D'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>DOS. Afte=
r the
employer has an adjudicated petition from the USCIS, the Department of State
(DOS) issues the visa to the H-2B workers. </p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>46a02 - Enforcement authority.</h4>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=3DMsoListParagraph>Effective January 18, 2009, WHD was delegated
enforcement authority from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under =
INA
¤ 214(c)(14)(A). This includes authority to impose administrative remedies =
on
an employer who substantially fails to meet any of the conditions of the
petition to admit or provide status to an H-2B worker or who willfully
misrepresents a material fact on such petition. The regulations for this
program are in 20 CFR Part 655 Subpart A. Questions or complaints concerning
the H-2B program should be directed to the nearest Wage and Hour Division
District Office. See http://www.dol.gov/whd/america2.htm. </p>

<p class=3DMsoListParagraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=3DMsoListParagraph>On February 21, 2012, the Department issued new=
 Final
Rule for the H-2B program.&nbsp; 77 FR 10038.&nbsp; On April 26, 2012, the
Final Rule was preliminarily enjoined by the court in Bayou Lawn &amp;
Landscape Servs. v. Solis, No. 3:12-cv-00183-MC-CJK, slip op. (N.D. Fla. Ap=
r.
26, 2012), appeal docketed, No. 12-12462 (11th Cir. May 15, 2012).&nbsp; The
2008 H-2B regulations were not at issue and are not affected by the district
court's preliminary decision in Bayou Lawn.&nbsp; Rather, as the district c=
ourt
explained, its preliminary injunction had the effect of &quot;preserving the
status quo&quot; of the 2008 rules.&nbsp; Bayou Lawn, Slip. Op. at 7.&nbsp;
This FOH Chapter relates to the 2008 rules only.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
