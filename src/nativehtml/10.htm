<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>In order for
the FLSA to apply there must be an employee-employer relationship. This
requires an “employer” and “employee” and the act or condition of employment.
FLSA Secs 3(d), (e) and (g) define the terms “employer”, “employee”, and
“employ”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The courts
have made it clear that the employment relationship under the FLSA is broader
than the traditional common law concept of the master and servant relationship.
The difference between the FLSA employment relationship and the common law
employment relationship arises from the FLSA statement that “Employ includes to
suffer or permit to work”. The courts have indicated that, while “to permit”
requires a more positive action than “to suffer”, both terms imply much less
positive action than required by the common law. Mere knowledge by an employer
of work done for him or her by another is sufficient to create the employment
relationship under the FLSA.</p>

not negate his/her status as an employee, if other indications of employment
are present. If the worker is paid, the fact that he or she is paid by the

basis of work time does not preclude a determination that the worker is, on the
facts, an employee with respect to the work for which such compensation is
received.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>There is no special provision in the FLSA which precludes an
employee-employer relationship between a religious, charitable or nonprofit
organization and persons who perform work for such an organization. For
example, a church or religious order may operate an establishment to print
books, magazines, or other publications and employ a regular staff who do this
work as a means of livelihood. In such cases there is an employee-employer
relationship for purposes of the Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Persons such as nuns, monks, priests, lay brothers, ministers,
deacons, and other members of religious orders who serve pursuant to their
religious obligations in the schools, hospitals, and other institutions
operated by their church or religious order shall not be considered to be “employees”.
However, the fact that such a person is a member of a religious order does not
preclude an employee-employer relationship with a State or secular institution.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In many cases the nature of religious, charitable and similar
nonprofit organizations, and schools is such that individuals may volunteer
their services in one capacity or another, usually on a part-time basis, not as
employees or in contemplation of pay for the services rendered. For example,
members of civic organizations may help out in a sheltered workshop; women’s
organizations may send members or students into hospitals or nursing homes to
provide certain personal services for the sick or the elderly; mothers may
assist in a school library or cafeteria as a public duty to maintain effective
services for their children; or fathers may drive a school bus to carry a
football team or band on a trip. Similarly, individuals may volunteer to
perform such tasks as driving vehicles or folding bandages for the Red Cross,
working with children with disabilities or disadvantaged youth, helping in
youth programs as camp counselors, scoutmasters, den mothers, providing child
care assistance for needy working mothers, soliciting contributions or
participating in benefit programs for such organizations and volunteering other
services needed to carry out their charitable, educational, or religious
programs. The fact that services are performed under such circumstances is not
sufficient to create an employee-employer relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Although the volunteer services (as described in (c) above) are
not considered to create an employment relationship, the organizations for
which they are performed will generally also have employees performing
compensated service whose employment is subject to the standards of the Act.
Where such an employment relationship exists, the Act requires payment of not
less than the statutory wages for all hours “worked” in the w/w. However, there
are certain circumstances where such an employee may donate services as a
volunteer, and the time so spent is not considered to be compensable “work”.
For example, an office employee of a hospital may volunteer to sit with a sick
child or elderly person during off-duty hours as an act of charity. WH will not
consider that an employee-employer relationship exists with respect to such
volunteer time between the establishment and the volunteer or between the
volunteer and the person for whose benefit the service is performed. Another
example is where an office employee of a church may volunteer to perform
non-clerical services in the church preschool during off duty time from his or
her office work as an act of charity. Conversely, a preschool employee may
volunteer to perform work in some other facet of the church’s operations
without an employment relationship being formed with respect to such volunteer
time. However, this does not mean that a regular office employee of a
charitable organization can volunteer services on an uncompensated basis to
handle correspondence in connection with a special fund drive or to handle
other work arising from exigencies of the operations conducted by the employer.</p>

</span></span>As part of their overall educational program, public or private
schools and institutions of higher learning may permit or require students to
engage in activities in connection with dramatics, student publications, glee
clubs, bands, choirs, debating teams, radio stations, intramural and
interscholastic athletics and other similar endeavors. Activities of students
in such programs, conducted primarily for the benefit of the participants as a
part of the educational opportunities provided to the students by the school or
institution, are not “work” of the kind contemplated by Sec 3(g) of the Act and
do not result in an employee-employer relationship between the student and the
school or institution. Also, the fact that a student may receive a minimal
payment for participation is such activities would not necessarily create an
employment relationship.</p>

</span></span>The sole fact that a student helps in a school lunchroom or
cafeteria for periods of 30 minutes to an hour per day in exchange for their
lunch is not considered to be sufficient to make him or her an employee of the
school, regardless of whether he or she performs such work regularly or only on
occasion. Also, the fact that students on occasion do some cleaning up of a
classroom, serve the school as junior patrol officers or perform minor clerical
work in the school office or library for periods of an hour per day or less
without contemplation of compensation or in exchange or a meal or for a cash
amount reasonably equivalent to the price of a meal or, when a cash amount is
given in addition to a meal, it is only a nominal sum, is not considered
sufficient in itself to characterize the students as employees of the school. A
similar policy will be followed where the students perform such tasks less
frequently but for a full day, with an arrangement to perform their academic
work for such days at other times. For example, the students may perform
full-day cafeteria service four times per year. In such cases, the time devoted
to cafeteria work in the aggregate would be less than if the student worked an
hour per day. However, if there are other indicia of employment or the students
normally devote more than an hour each day or equivalent to such work, the
circumstances of the arrangement should be reviewed carefully.</p>

assumed by WH to be part of an employment relationship unless the facts
indicate that the training situation has not materially changed. Thus, if the
conditions which warranted the finding that the student is not considered an
employee continue, he or she may remain for a period of time as a trainee
rather than an employee. On the other hand, if after the 3-month period the
training aspects are subordinated and the work aspects clearly predominate, the
student will be considered as an employee.</p>

contracts under which the company purports to “sell” its products to them at
fixed wholesale prices and to “recommend” retail prices at which the products

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The
principles in FOH 10b03(c) may apply with respect to certain governmental
activities. For example, an office employee of the city may volunteer to
perform nonclerical services, such as coaching a softball or basketball team in
a city-sponsored program during his or her off-duty time as a charitable or
civil act. Similarly a person may participate in the civil defense program for
civil or personal motives. Where a person performs such volunteer services
without promise or expectation of compensation, at hours that suit his or her
own convenience whether by schedule or otherwise, and where no regular employee
is replaced in the performance of normal duties, no employer-employee
relationship exists with respect to such time. The activity may be performed on
the employer’s premises so long as it is not done during any time the employee
is required to be on the premises and the control exercised by the employer is
only minimal. A person, however, may not be both an employee and a volunteer
while performing essentially the same duties. Thus, for example, a person
employed in park activities cannot have his or her time divided into “working
hours” and “volunteer hours” while performing the same or related duties.</p>

</span></span>Whether individuals who provide child care services in their own
homes under an agreement with a government social service agency are employees
of such agency would depend upon the total fact situation involved in the
arrangement. If the parent (or person standing in the place of a parent) is
free to select, and in fact does select, an individual from a list of persons
supplied by the agency as qualified to perform the child care services, with
the agency merely agreeing to reimburse the child care “operator” selected, an
employee-employer relationship would not exist between the government agency
and the operator. Further, if the agency utilizes bona fide volunteers as day
care operators over whom no control is exercised, and the monetary payment is
simply to reimburse the operator for expenses, no employment relationship would
exist. However, the activities of such day care homes may be covered under the
Act, and the operator responsible for compliance with respect to any employees
employed in connection with the operation of the child care center. (See also

partnership is a “person” for purposes of the FLSA, and may be a party to the
employment relationship as an employer. The employment relationship is not

contains nothing to indicate that cooperative organizations, as such, are to be
excluded form the category of employers subject to its terms. It is clear that
the employment relationship may exist at least between such an organization and
non-members whom it hires or suffers or permits to work. Nor can it be said
that membership in a cooperative in the ordinary case establishes a mutual
agency analogous to a partnership or otherwise identifies the member so closely
with the cooperative that they cannot become, respectively, employer and
employee. Among the circumstances which may be taken to indicate that a
cooperative is an entity separate and distinct from its worker-members, are a
corporate form of organization, the presence of the usual incidents of the
employment relationship (for example, control by the governing body or a
designated officer over the work performed, the member’s hours of labor,
selection for and discharge from the job and the like) and the exercise of
financial or managerial control or the furnishing of capital or management
services by outsiders, especially if such outsiders are wholesalers, manufacturers,
or others who purchase or dispose of the products of the cooperatives.</p>

corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its stockholders. In
the ordinary case, a corporation and a stockholder therein can become parties
to the employment relationship as employer and employee, and a worker who is,
in other respects, in the position of an employee of a corporation must be
treated as such for the purposes of the FLSA, even though the worker owns
shares of stock in his or her corporate employer. Ownership of stock does not
destroy the duality of the parties to the relationship, even where the worker

corporation’s work.</p>

FLSA does not expressly exclude foreign governments from the category of
employers subject to its provisions, the usual principles of international
comity are applied to exclude the direct agencies of such governments from
compliance with the Act. This rule, however, applies only if the agency is
exercising part of the sovereign power of the foreign government. If the agency
is a commercial one engaged in commercial operations in competition with
American industries, the agency is not excluded under this principle and the
employees are entitled to the benefits of the FLSA. The United Nations is in
the same category as a foreign government.</p>

</span></span>The government of a State, that is, all the departments and
agencies of any of the 50 States, constitutes a single employer under the Act.
Similarly, the government of a political subdivision, e.g., county, city, etc.,
with all of its departments and agencies, constitutes a single employer under
the Act. However, such entities are separate and distinct from the government
of the State and from other political subdivisions. Thus, for example, where an
employee works for more than one agency of the State government, or for more
than one agency of a political subdivision, such employee’s employment is by a
single employer. Each agency is both individually and coequally responsible for
compliance with all applicable provisions of the Act with respect to such employee.
