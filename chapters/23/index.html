              <h3>23a00 - General provisions.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Sec 13(a) (8) provides an exemption
from the MW and OT provisions of the FLSA for “any employee employed in
connection with the publication of any weekly, semiweekly, or daily newspaper
with a circulation of less than four thousand the major part of which
circulation is within the county where published or counties contiguous
thereto”.</p><p>(b)  The exemption applies only where the
major part of the newspaper’s circulation is within the county in which it is
published, within contiguous counties, or within some combination of these
counties. The exemption would apply, for example, where none of the circulation
is within the county in which a newspaper is published provided a major part of
its circulation is within contiguous counties. A “contiguous county”, for
purposes of Sec 13(a)(8), means a county which at some point shares a common
boundary with the county in which the newspaper is published. “Contiguous
counties” need not be in the same State.</p>

purpose of determining whether the circulation of such papers is less than the
maximum set forth in Sec 13(a)(8). If the situation is one where the purported
separate publications are properly to be regarded as one and the same newspaper,
the total circulation of both newspapers would have to be considered in
determining whether the exemption applies. If the two publications, in addition
to their different mastheads, carry different local news items, the
publications should be considered as two different newspapers in testing for
the exemption under Sec 13(a)(8).</p>

newspaper offices. Any employee who engages in the sale of such items will not
be exempt if the newspaper is part of a Sec 3(s)(1) enterprise or if any of the

              <p>(a)   As Sec 13(d) is a CL exemption as
well as an MW and OT exemption, there can be no tolerance for nonexempt work.
If any of the work performed by the minor is not exempt under the section, the
exemption does not apply.</p><p>(b)  However, if the minors are 14 and 15
years old, their employment may be permissible even though the Sec 13(d)
exemption is defeated by the performance of nonexempt work. For example, if the
duties of the minors consist wholly of exempt work and nonexempt work which is
permitted by CL Reg 3, their employment would be permissible provided it
complies with the conditions of that Reg. One of the conditions is that the
work must not be performed so as to be a part of the manufacturing process and
must not be performed in any manufacturing or processing room or work place.</p>

as an incident to his own sale or delivery of the newspapers to individual
consumers is work exempt under Sec 13(d), whether performed in or out of the
newspaper plant. However, the folding by the minor of newspapers for delivery
by other newsboys does not constitute work which is immediately incidental to

employees are engaged in the door-to-door solicitation of newspaper
subscriptions. Where the employees carry current issues of the newspaper and
attempt to sell them as part of their solicitation work, such employment is
considered to be within the Sec 13(d) exemption. The work can reasonably be
regarded as involving the street sale of newspapers to the consumer.</p><p>(b)  However, the solicitation of
newspaper subscriptions for delivery by a person other than the soliciting
employee would not be exempt work under Sec 13(d). The solicitation of
newspaper subscriptions for delivery by other persons (newsboys) does not
constitute work relating to the newsboy’s delivery of newspapers to the
consumer. Nevertheless, the possible application of the Reg 541.5 exemption
should not be overlooked. The work may be permissible under CL Reg 3 provided
it complies with the conditions of that Reg.</p>

              <p>Certain newspapers, as a sales
promotion device, may sell accident and health insurance to their subscribers.
The subscriber makes the initial purchase of the insurance from the newspaper
by mail. The insurance premiums (usually 10¢ a week) are paid by the subscribers
to the carrier who delivers their newspapers at the same time that the carrier
collects for the newspapers. The insurance is sold only to the subscribers of
the newspaper and the carrier collects insurance premiums only from subscribers
to whom he also delivers the newspaper.  Under these circumstances, the
collection of insurance premiums by a carrier as a part of his collection of
the newspaper subscription is an incidental activity to the delivery of the
newspaper and collection therefor, and thus will not defeat the Sec 13(d)
exemption.</p>

exemption for “any switchboard operator employed by an independently owned
public telephone company which has not more than 750 stations”.</p>

              <p>(a)   The unit to which the 750 station test
is applied for purposes of Sec 13(a)(10) is “an independently owned public
telephone company”. The exemption is thus limited to small telephone companies
the ownership of which is independent of the ownership of any other telephone
company. For example, where a telephone company’s stock is owned by another
company the two telephone companies form one independently owned public
telephone company for the purposes of the exemption. Therefore, the exemption
would not apply if the total stations of the two companies exceed 750.</p><p>(b)  The phrase “independently owned” as
used in Sec 13(a)(l0) is not synonymous with the phrase “separate company”.
Thus, where several telephone companies are under common ownership, the
exemption will not apply if the total stations serviced by the several
companies exceed 750.</p>

              <p>(a)   If all other tests are met, the Sec
13(a)(l0) exemption is available only for employees employed in the capacity of
“switchboard operator”. Clerical work in connection with subscribers’ long
distance calls or telegrams, so-called secretarial services performed by the
operator for subscribers through the use of the switchboard itself, the making
of minor repairs, the testing of lines with linemen, the billing of customers,
the collection of bills from customers who call at the exchange, and like work
which is customarily performed by switchboard operators employed by such a
small telephone company comes within the exemption.</p><p>(b)  Whether such other duties as sales
promotion or public relations work, soliciting new business, making bank
deposits, or collecting bills at customers’ homes or business places are exempt
or nonexempt depends upon whether such work is customarily performed as a part
of the duties of a switchboard operator employed by such a small telephone
company. This will generally be determined on the basis of functions
necessarily so performed because the operator is the only representative of the
telephone company available to perform such services, in which event the duties
would be exempt.</p><p>(c)   The exemption is not applicable to
such operators who spend more than 20% of their working time in any workweek in
nonexempt work. (See IB 786, Subpart C.)</p>

stations. Where operators of one company’s exchanges provide direct toll,
information and assistance services to subscribers of a second company’s

exchange of the company for the sole purpose of furnishing toll service on
calls between subscribers of the manual exchange and another company’s exchange
which has a dial operation, the stations served by such other company’s dial
