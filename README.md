## Developer

This project is a series of static html files that are generated as part
of a build process. The build process can be run with `npm run build`,
which runs 'src/build.js'.

In order to run this file you will need 'pandoc', which you can get via
`brew install pandoc`.

To convert from docx files to source html files, run `build.js`
