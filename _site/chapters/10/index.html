            <h3>10a00 - Purpose of chapter.</h3>
            <p>FOH Chapter
10 contains interpretations regarding the employment relationship required for
FLSA to apply, the geographical limits of the Act’s applicability, and
employment which is specifically excluded from coverage under the Act. These
coverage concepts are equally applicable to activities which constitute
engagement in or production for interstate or foreign commerce and to employment
in an enterprise described in Sec 3(s)</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10b00"></div>
            <h3>10b00 - Employment relationship required for FLSA to
apply.</h3>
            <p>In order for
the FLSA to apply there must be an employee-employer relationship. This
requires an “employer” and “employee” and the act or condition of employment.
FLSA Secs 3(d), (e) and (g) define the terms “employer”, “employee”, and
“employ”.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10b01"></div>
            <h3>10b01 - FLSA employment relationship distinguished
from the common law concept.</h3>
            <p>The courts
have made it clear that the employment relationship under the FLSA is broader
than the traditional common law concept of the master and servant relationship.
The difference between the FLSA employment relationship and the common law
employment relationship arises from the FLSA statement that “Employ includes to
suffer or permit to work”. The courts have indicated that, while “to permit”
requires a more positive action than “to suffer”, both terms imply much less
positive action than required by the common law. Mere knowledge by an employer
of work done for him or her by another is sufficient to create the employment
relationship under the FLSA.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10b02"></div>
            <h3>10b02 - Method of compensation not material.</h3>
            <p>The fact
that no compensation is paid and the worker is dependent entirely on tips does
not negate his/her status as an employee, if other indications of employment
are present. If the worker is paid, the fact that he or she is paid by the
piece or by the job or on a percentage or commission basis rather than on the
basis of work time does not preclude a determination that the worker is, on the
facts, an employee with respect to the work for which such compensation is
received.</p>

There is no special provision in the FLSA which precludes an
employee-employer relationship between a religious, charitable or nonprofit
organization and persons who perform work for such an organization. For
example, a church or religious order may operate an establishment to print
books, magazines, or other publications and employ a regular staff who do this
work as a means of livelihood. In such cases there is an employee-employer
relationship for purposes of the Act.</p><p>(b)           
Persons such as nuns, monks, priests, lay brothers, ministers,
deacons, and other members of religious orders who serve pursuant to their
religious obligations in the schools, hospitals, and other institutions
operated by their church or religious order shall not be considered to be “employees”.
However, the fact that such a person is a member of a religious order does not
preclude an employee-employer relationship with a State or secular institution.</p><p>(c)           
In many cases the nature of religious, charitable and similar
nonprofit organizations, and schools is such that individuals may volunteer
their services in one capacity or another, usually on a part-time basis, not as
employees or in contemplation of pay for the services rendered. For example,
members of civic organizations may help out in a sheltered workshop; women’s
organizations may send members or students into hospitals or nursing homes to
provide certain personal services for the sick or the elderly; mothers may
assist in a school library or cafeteria as a public duty to maintain effective
services for their children; or fathers may drive a school bus to carry a
football team or band on a trip. Similarly, individuals may volunteer to
perform such tasks as driving vehicles or folding bandages for the Red Cross,
working with children with disabilities or disadvantaged youth, helping in
youth programs as camp counselors, scoutmasters, den mothers, providing child
care assistance for needy working mothers, soliciting contributions or
participating in benefit programs for such organizations and volunteering other
services needed to carry out their charitable, educational, or religious
programs. The fact that services are performed under such circumstances is not
sufficient to create an employee-employer relationship.</p><p>(d)           
Although the volunteer services (as described in (c) above) are
not considered to create an employment relationship, the organizations for
which they are performed will generally also have employees performing
compensated service whose employment is subject to the standards of the Act.
Where such an employment relationship exists, the Act requires payment of not
less than the statutory wages for all hours “worked” in the w/w. However, there
are certain circumstances where such an employee may donate services as a
volunteer, and the time so spent is not considered to be compensable “work”.
For example, an office employee of a hospital may volunteer to sit with a sick
child or elderly person during off-duty hours as an act of charity. WH will not
consider that an employee-employer relationship exists with respect to such
volunteer time between the establishment and the volunteer or between the
volunteer and the person for whose benefit the service is performed. Another
example is where an office employee of a church may volunteer to perform
non-clerical services in the church preschool during off duty time from his or
her office work as an act of charity. Conversely, a preschool employee may
volunteer to perform work in some other facet of the church’s operations
without an employment relationship being formed with respect to such volunteer
time. However, this does not mean that a regular office employee of a
charitable organization can volunteer services on an uncompensated basis to
handle correspondence in connection with a special fund drive or to handle
other work arising from exigencies of the operations conducted by the employer.</p><p>(e)           
As part of their overall educational program, public or private
schools and institutions of higher learning may permit or require students to
engage in activities in connection with dramatics, student publications, glee
clubs, bands, choirs, debating teams, radio stations, intramural and
interscholastic athletics and other similar endeavors. Activities of students
in such programs, conducted primarily for the benefit of the participants as a
part of the educational opportunities provided to the students by the school or
institution, are not “work” of the kind contemplated by Sec 3(g) of the Act and
do not result in an employee-employer relationship between the student and the
school or institution. Also, the fact that a student may receive a minimal
payment for participation is such activities would not necessarily create an
employment relationship.</p><p>(f)           
The sole fact that a student helps in a school lunchroom or
cafeteria for periods of 30 minutes to an hour per day in exchange for their
lunch is not considered to be sufficient to make him or her an employee of the
school, regardless of whether he or she performs such work regularly or only on
occasion. Also, the fact that students on occasion do some cleaning up of a
classroom, serve the school as junior patrol officers or perform minor clerical
work in the school office or library for periods of an hour per day or less
without contemplation of compensation or in exchange or a meal or for a cash
amount reasonably equivalent to the price of a meal or, when a cash amount is
given in addition to a meal, it is only a nominal sum, is not considered
sufficient in itself to characterize the students as employees of the school. A
similar policy will be followed where the students perform such tasks less
frequently but for a full day, with an arrangement to perform their academic
work for such days at other times. For example, the students may perform
full-day cafeteria service four times per year. In such cases, the time devoted
to cafeteria work in the aggregate would be less than if the student worked an
hour per day. However, if there are other indicia of employment or the students
normally devote more than an hour each day or equivalent to such work, the
circumstances of the arrangement should be reviewed carefully.</p><p>(g)           
In the ordinary case, tasks performed as a normal part of a
program of treatment, rehabilitation, or vocational training in the following
situations will not be considered, under Sec 3(g) of the Act, as “work” of a
kind requiring a hospital patient, school student, or institutional inmate to
be considered an employee of the hospital, school, or institution conducting
the program, for purposes of the FLSA: tasks performed by individuals committed
to training schools of a correctional nature, which are required as a part of
the correctional program of the institution as a part of the institutional
discipline and by reason of their value in providing needed therapy,
rehabilitation, or training to help prepare the inmate to become
self-sustaining in a lawful occupation after release</p><p>(h)          
WH will not assert that initial participation by a student with
disabilities in a school-work program constitutes an employment relationship if
certain conditions are met. However, after an employment relationship has
developed, the provisions of the Act will be applicable.</p><p>(i)            
The conditions under which an employment relationship initially
will not be asserted are:</p><p>(1)          
The activities are basically educational, are conducted primarily
for the benefit of the participants, and comprise one of the facets of the
educational opportunities provided to the students. The student may receive
some payment for their work in order to have a more realistic work situation,
or as an incentive to the student or to insure that the employer will treat the
student as a worker.</p><p>(2)          
The time in attendance at the school plus the time in attendance
at the experience station (either in the school or with an outside employer)
does not substantially exceed the time the student would be required to attend
school if following a normal academic schedule. Time in excess of 1 hour beyond
the normal school schedule or attendance at the experience station on days when
school is not in session would be considered substantial.</p><p>(j)            
The student does not displace a regular employee or impair the
employment opportunities of others by performing work which would otherwise be
performed by regular employees who would be employed by the school or an
independent contractor including, for example, employees of a contractor
operating the food service facilities at the school.</p><p>(k)          
The shift to an employment relationship may occur shortly after
the placement or it may occur later. As a general guide, work for a particular
employer, either a private employer or the school, after 3 months will be
assumed by WH to be part of an employment relationship unless the facts
indicate that the training situation has not materially changed. Thus, if the
conditions which warranted the finding that the student is not considered an
employee continue, he or she may remain for a period of time as a trainee
rather than an employee. On the other hand, if after the 3-month period the
training aspects are subordinated and the work aspects clearly predominate, the
student will be considered as an employee.</p>

            <h3>10b04 - Employer asserts homework
performed by independent contractor.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
For investigation purposes, it can be assumed that a homeworker
is an employee, even though there may be a buying and selling arrangement
between the parties.</p><p>(b)           
If the employer asserts their outside work or homework is
performed by independent contractors, the following factors should be
considered concerning the employee-employer relationship:</p><p>(1)          
Does the employer have the right to control the manner of the
performance of the work or the time in which the work is to be done?</p><p>(2)          
Is the employer paying taxes for social security, unemployment,
or workmen’s compensation insurance?</p><p>(3)          
Has the homeworker ever collected any benefits, such as
unemployment or workmen’s compensation, because of employment by the employer?</p><p>(4)          
Does the employer furnish the material, or finance directly or
indirectly the purchase of the material which the homeworker uses?</p><p>(5)          
When did the practice of buying and selling between the employer
and the homeworker begin, and what are the mechanics of the transaction?</p><p>(6)          
Does the homeworker bill the employer for the work done? Are
bills of sale prepared? Are sales taxes paid, or are State or local exemptions
obtained because of retail purposes? Are payments made in cash or by check?</p><p>(7)          
How does the homeworker’s profit under the buying-selling
arrangement compare with their wages as a homeworker?</p><p>(8)          
Whom does the homeworker consider to be the employer?</p><p>(9)          
Does the homeworker have a State certificate to do homework?</p><p>(10)       
What equipment is used, what is its value, and who furnishes it?</p>

            <h3>10b05 - Test of the employment
relationship.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
The principal test relied upon by the courts for determining
whether an employment relationship exists has been whether the possible
employer controls or has the right to control the work to be done by the
possible employee to the extent of prescribing how the work shall be performed.
Additional considerations are the method of payment and how free the possible
employer is to replace the possible employee with another. However, the Supreme
Court has said that there is “no definition that solves all problems as to the
limitations of the employer-employee relationship” under the FLSA. A determination
of the relationship cannot be based on “isolated factors” or upon a single
characteristic “but rather upon the circumstances of the whole activity”</p><p>(b)           
The factors which the Supreme Court has considered significant,
although no single one is regarded as controlling, are:</p><p>(1)          
the extent to which the services in question are an integral part
of the employer’s business;</p><p>(2)          
the amount of the alleged contractor’s investment in facilities
and equipment;</p><p>(3)          
the alleged contractor’s opportunities for profit and loss; and,</p><p>(4)          
the amount of initiative, judgment, or foresight in open market
competition with others required for the success of the claimed independent
enterprise.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10b06"></div>
            <h3>10b06 - Amount of control.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Where the facts clearly establish that the possible employee is
the subordinate party, the relationship is one of employment. To determine the
amount of control consider:</p><p>(1)          
whether there are restrictive provisions in the contract between
the possible employer and possible employee which require that the work must be
satisfactory to the possible employer and detailing, or giving the possible
employer the right to detail, how the work is to be performed;</p><p>(2)          
whether the possible employer has control over the business of
the person performing work for them, even though the possible employer does not
control the particular circumstances of the work;</p><p>(3)          
whether the contract is for an indefinite period or for a
relatively long period;</p><p>(4)          
whether the possible employer may discharge employees of the
alleged independent contractor;</p><p>(5)          
whether the possible employer may cancel the contract at their
discretion, and on how much notice;</p><p>(6)          
whether the work done by the alleged independent contractor is
the same or similar to that done by admitted employees.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10b07"></div>
            <h3>10b07 - Other considerations.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Since the determination of whether an employment relationship
exists depends “upon the circumstances of the whole activity”, particular
factors to be considered are:</p><p>(1)          
Is the alleged independent contractor listed on the payroll with
the appropriate tax deductions, or are the payments to them charged to the
labor and salary account or selling expense account instead of to the account
to which attorney’s fees, auditor’s fees, and the like, are charged?</p><p>(2)          
Must employees of the alleged independent contractor be approved
by the possible employer?</p><p>(3)          
Does the possible employer keep the books and prepare the payroll
for the possible employee?</p><p>(4)          
Is the alleged independent contractor assigned to a particular
territory without freedom of movement outside thereof?</p><p>(5)          
Does the alleged independent contractor have an independent
economic or other interest in their work, other than increasing their own pay?</p><p>(6)          
How do the respective tax returns of the parties list the
remuneration paid?</p><p>(b)           
If the possible employer has control over the manner in which the
work is to be performed, the absence of any or all of the foregoing factors
will not indicate an absence of the employer-employee relationship. However,
where the element of control cannot be firmly established, they will help in
determining whether the relationship is one of employer and employee or of
independent contractors.</p><p>(c)           
The following factors are immaterial to the determination of
whether the relationship is one of employer-employee or of independent contractors:</p><p>(1)          
the State or local government grants a license to the alleged
independent contractor;</p><p>(2)          
the measurement, method, or designation of compensation;</p><p>(3)          
the fact that no compensation is paid and the alleged independent
contractor must rely entirely on tips;</p><p>(4)          
the place where the work is performed;</p><p>(5)          
the absence of a formal employment agreement. </p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10b08"></div>
            <h3>10b08 - Effect of “sale” on the employment
relationship.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
An employment relationship may exist between the parties to a
transaction which is nominally a “sale” Thus, house-to-house canvassers who
sell at retail the products of a particular company are employees of the
company, although their contracts with the company are in the form of “dealer”
contracts under which the company purports to “sell” its products to them at
fixed wholesale prices and to “recommend” retail prices at which the products
should be sold, where the control exercised by the company over the so-called
“dealers” is not substantially different than that exercised by an employer
over their outside salesmen.</p><p>(b)           
Likewise, an employee is not converted into an independent
contractor by virtue of a fictitious “sale” of the goods produced by him or her
to an employer, so long as the other indications of the employment relationship
exist. Homeworkers who “sell” their products to a manufacturer are his or her
employees where the control exercised by the manufacturer over the homeworkers
through their ability to reject or refuse to “buy” the product is not
essentially different from the control ordinarily exercised by a manufacturer
over employees performing work for him or her at home on a piece rate basis.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10b09"></div>
            <h3>10b09 - Subject-matter of the employment relationship.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
The subject-matter of the employment relationship must be work or
its equivalent. The Supreme Court has set forth the essential elements of work
as:</p><p>(1)          
physical or mental exertion (whether burdensome or not);</p><p>(2)          
controlled or required by the employer; and,</p><p>(3)          
pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer
and his or her business.</p><p>(b)           
An essential element of work is not only that the employer
receives certain benefits from the services of the alleged employees but that
“the work necessarily or primarily benefits the company”.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10b10"></div>
            <h3>10b10 - Effect of determination of the employment
relationship.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Once it is determined that one who is reputedly an independent
contractor, lessee, partner, or the like, is in fact an employee, then all the
employees of this so-called independent contractor engaged in the work for the
principal employer likewise become the employees of the principal employer, who
must guarantee compliance with the FLSA. Thus, the one who is responsible will
be charged with seeing to compliance with the FLSA and must keep the records of
the employees.</p><p>(b)           
However, a manufacturer or producer may undertake to see to it
that a true independent contractor complies with the FLSA, in order to avoid
interference with the manufacturer’s own operations through “hot goods” action
under FLSA Sec. 15(a)(1). Such an arrangement does not make the manufacturer or
producer the employer.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10b11"></div>
            <h3>10b11 - Trainees and student-trainees.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
The Supreme Court has held that the words “to suffer or permit to
work,” as used in the FLSA to define “employ”, do not make all persons
employees who, without any express or implied compensation agreement, may work
for their own advantages on the premises of another.</p><p>(b)           
Whether trainees or students are employees of an employer under
the FLSA will depend upon all of the circumstances surrounding their activities
on the premises of the employer. If all six of the following criteria apply,
the trainees or students are not employees within the meaning of the FLSA:</p><p>(1)          
the training, even though it includes actual operation of the
facilities of the employer, is similar to that which would be given in a
vocational school;</p><p>(2)          
the training is for the benefit of the trainees or students;</p><p>(3)          
the trainees or students do not displace regular employees, but
work under their close observation;</p><p>(4)          
the employer that provides the training derives no immediate
advantages from the activities of the trainees or students, and on occasion
operations may actually be impeded;</p><p>(5)          
the trainees or students are not necessarily entitled to a job at
the conclusion of the training period; and,</p><p>(6)          
the employer and the trainees or students understand that the
trainees or students are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10b12"></div>
            <h3>10b12 - Government sponsored employment development
programs.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Certain Federal and State training programs are designed to equip
the labor force in an area with needed and marketable skills and may be
specifically directed toward providing local industries with a labor pool from
which workers having particular skills may be drawn.</p><p>(b)           
Inv’s may encounter programs of this type conducted under the
auspices of Federal and State agencies in which the facilities of business
establishments are utilized during training hours under an agreement or lease
arrangement with the agency. The instructors for such programs may, outside of
training hours, be employed by the establishment whose facilities are used.
Certain of the workers being trained may also be employed by this establishment
outside of training hours.</p><p>(c)           
Where the employees of the establishment are involved as either
instructors or trainees, particular care shall be taken to determine whether
there exists in actual fact an employment relationship, between the employer
being investigated and the employees involved, during the hours devoted
exclusively to the training program. The fact that the employer’s facilities
are utilized in the training program is not determinative of the existence of
an employment relationship between the employer and trainees or instructors
involved insofar as the hours devoted exclusively to such training is
concerned. Nor is the fact that the training program is directly related to the
employees’ regular jobs in itself controlling where, as may be the case, the
program is an independent training course conducted by the agency from which
both employees and the employer benefit. (See FOH 10b11 and IB Part 785.27
through 785.32.)</p><p>(d)           
These instructions do not reflect a change in policy regarding
the applicability of FLSA to trainees who are employees, during the training
periods, of establishments investigated. They are designed, instead, to call
attention to the need for a careful examination of the facts in each situation
where training programs of the general type described are encountered. The
existence of an employment relationship during training periods is of
particular significance since an employee may be subject to FLSA by virtue of
employment in a covered enterprise even though not engaged in or producing
goods for interstate commerce.</p>

            <h3>10b13 - Employer identification numbers issued by
Internal Revenue Service.</h3>
            <p>The issuance
of employer identification numbers by the Internal Revenue Service does not
constitute a determination as to employee-employer relationship under the FLSA.</p>

            <h3>10b14 - Students training in skilled paramedical
occupations - nurses, x-ray technicians, etc.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Whether a student training for certain paramedical occupations is
viewed as an employee of a hospital within the meaning of the Act will depend
upon all the circumstances of the student’s activities on the premises of the
establishment. Where a bona fide student training program exists for such
paramedical occupations, and such program meets the criteria in Sec 10b11, no
employment relationship will be deemed to exist. Generally this involves
students training for such occupations as registered nurse, licensed vocational
or practical nurse, x-ray technician, certified laboratory assistant, or any
other skilled paramedical position. Such programs involve on-the-job training
combined with extensive classroom lectures and laboratory instruction generally
resulting in students receiving degrees, licensing, registration, or
certification by an appropriate board or society. The mere payment of a
scholarship, stipend, or allowance (as long as it does not exceed a reasonable
approximation of the expenses incurred by the trainee taking the course or
where it serves as an allowance for subsistence) will not be considered to
establish an employment relationship.</p><p>(b)           
Situations may be encountered where such a student will work in
the hospital for compensation outside of the training schedule. In the typical
case a student may do office or switchboard work. In such cases the student
will be considered an employee during the time spent on such work and must be
paid in compliance with the Act’s requirements for such time. However, the fact
that the student would be considered an employee during such time would not
require the time spent in activities described in (a) above to be counted as
hours worked.</p><p>(c)           
On the other hand, the principles in (a) above do not include
certain training programs such as those conducted for nurses aides and
orderlies where much of the training consists of on-the-job training and work
experience with little if any related classroom lectures or laboratory
instructions and which ordinarily do not lead to licensing, registration or
certification. In many cases these programs exist only for the purpose of
filling existing vacancies on the hospital staff. In such cases the students
would be considered employees of the hospital. In this regard any time spent in
the classroom or attending lectures would not be considered hours worked.</p>

            <p>Golf course
caddies are engaged to serve the needs of particular players for substantial
periods of time and their services are generally directed by and are of most
immediate benefit to the players themselves. Arrangements may vary but the
players, in one way or another, are expected to pay for the services rendered
to them by the caddy. Because of these circumstances, WH is not prepared to
assert that caddies are employees of the golf course operator.</p>

            <h3>10b16 - Special duty nurses or “sitters” in hospitals
and nursing homes.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
In some cases a special duty nurse or “sitter” may be employed to
care for a patient in a hospital or nursing home. Whether the employee is employed
by the patient or by the hospital or nursing home is a question of fact. For
example, if the hospital or nursing home determines whether use of a special
duty nurse or “sitter” will be permitted, what the pay is to be (even though
paid directly by the patient), and decides which special duty nurse or “sitter”
will be assigned to a particular patient, the hospital or nursing home is
considered to be the employer.</p><p>(b)           
On the other hand, if the patient or their representative
contracts directly with the special duty nurse or “sitter” as to pay, hours of
work and other working conditions, and the establishment does not control or
supervise such work, an employment relationship does not exist between the
special duty nurse or “sitter” and the establishment. This same principle will
apply to a nurse or other employee on the hospital or nursing home staff who is
employed during her off-duty hours as a special duty nurse or “sitter” by a
patient in the establishment. During the period or periods in which the employee
is so engaged on this special duty by the patient, WH will consider the
employment relationship as with the patient and not with the hospital or
nursing home.</p><p>(c)           
A special duty nurse or “sitter” who is employed by the patient
to care for such patient in a hospital or nursing home, as described in (b)
above, is not employed “in connection with the operation of” the hospital or
nursing home (see Sec 3(r)). The employment is in the nursing home or hospital
only because the patient is there and the work is not connected “with the
operation of” the hospital or nursing home as such.</p>

            <h3>10b17 - Newspaper “area correspondents” or
“stringers”.</h3>
            <p>Some
newspapers have arrangements to obtain news stories (particularly local
interest stories from outlying areas served by the newspaper) from persons
identified in the industry as “area correspondents” or “stringers”. These
writers ordinarily select their own materials which they obtain in the course
of other occupations or while attending local events such as parties, athletic
contests, and the like. They are paid on a per word or per line basis for
stories submitted and accepted by the newspaper. The arrangements vary but
traditionally the newspapers have considered these people to be in the same
general category as professional free-lance writers and not employees. WH will
not assert that an employee-employer relationship exists in such cases.</p>

            <h3>10b18 - Graduate students - research assistants.</h3>
            <p>In some
cases graduate students in colleges and universities are engaged in research in
the course of obtaining advanced degrees and the research is performed under
the supervision of a member of the faculty in a research environment provided
by the institution under a grant or contract. Normally, the graduate students
involved in these programs are simultaneously performing research under the
grants or contracts and fulfilling the requirements of an advanced degree.
Under such circumstances, WH will not assert an employee-employer relationship
between the students and the school, or between the student and the grantor or
contracting agency, even though the student receives a stipend for their
services under the grant or contract.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10b19"></div>
            <h3>10b19 - Externs.</h3>
            <p>In some
cases medical students elect in their senior year of medical school to work as
“externs” in a hospital for a short period, sometimes six weeks. An extern is
assigned to one of the hospital’s major areas of post-graduate training, such
as medicine, general surgery or obstetrics. They attend the needs of patients
under the immediate supervision of licensed physicians and also attend
conferences, teaching rounds, and classroom exercises. The program is designed
to provide the student with professional experience in the furtherance of their
medical education in the same general manner as that provided interns. Such a
program constitutes a part of the educational opportunities provided to the

WH will not assert that such externs are employees of the hospital to which
they are assigned.</p>

            <h3>10b20 - Administrative residents in hospitals.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Some college graduate school programs provide that candidates for
the degree of Master of Hospital Administration (sometimes identified as Master
of Business Administration, Master of Arts, Master of Public Health, etc.) must
serve a certain period (often 12 months) of administrative residency in a
hospital. The candidates continue as students on the rolls of the college. In
the usual case, the hospital administrator responsible for the resident is also
on the college faculty. The resident performs various tasks in the hospital,
and generally prepares a thesis or various reports to the college concerning
hospital administration. The resident may receive a stipend or allowance from
the hospital. Pending interpretation by the courts, WH for purposes of
enforcement of the Act will not assert that such students are employees of the
hospital to which they are assigned as residents.</p><p>(b)           
In some instances, the resident to augment income may secure
employment in the hospital entirely apart from any duties performed as a
resident. The principles stated in FOH 10b14(b) apply to such employment.</p>

            <h3>10b21 - Student “observers” in hotels and motels.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Certain colleges providing academic training in hotel
administration require their students to obtain a stipulated number of practice
credits in order to qualify for a degree. These student act as “observers” in
hotels and motels, usually during the summer months. Typically, the students
have some assigned duties and move from department to department to learn the
business.  Generally, the students are paid a nominal sum, such as $100 per month
plus room and meals.</p><p>(b)           
Where such a program is designed to provide a student with
professional practice in the furtherance of his or her college education and
the training is academically oriented for the benefit of the student, WH will
not assert that the students are employees of the hotel or motel to which they
are assigned.</p>

            <h3>10b22  - Job Corps enrollees.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
The Job Corps is a residential program for youths between 16 and
21 years of age established under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as
amended. Enrollees live in a Job Corps center (or camp) which is operated by
either a governmental organization or a private organization, in either case
supervised by a Federal Agency. Under Sec 107(a) of this Act, the Director of
the Job Corps is authorized to “provide or arrange for the provision of
programs of useful work experience and other appropriate activities for
enrollees”.</p><p>(b)           
In implementing this provision, the Job Corps has made
arrangements for the enrollees to work in private firms where they may perform
work covered by the FLSA. Such arrangements with private employers are usually
for part-time work and the average duration is four months. In such work
experience programs, supervision over the enrollees is maintained in order to
monitor their progress and maximize the quality of training given them.
Arrangements are made between the Job Corps and the private employer-trainer
regarding the division of training costs and the payment of wages.</p><p>(c)           
If a Job Corps enrollee performs work subject to the FLSA in a private
firm in such a work experience program he would be considered for purposes of
the FLSA to be jointly employed by the corporation operating the center or camp
and the private employer. Wages paid to enrollees by either of the joint
employers will be considered in determining compliance with the Act.</p><p>(d)           
It is the position of Wage-Hour that where such an enrollee is
assigned to receive training and work experience with a private employer in an
off-the-center work site, the following activities will not create an
employee-employer relationship:</p><p>(1)          
In the preliminary stages of work experience, when the enrollee
has had little or no previous training in the occupation and does no useful
work, but is merely being acquainted with the employer’s business.</p><p>(2)          
Time spent by the enrollee in a classroom situation in which no
useful work is performed.</p><p>(e)           
The following activities will generally create an
employee-employer relationship assuming productive work is performed:</p><p>(1)          
When an enrollee has been sent to the employer for a short period
in order to determine his or her aptitude and interest in an occupation
preliminary to giving training.</p><p>(2)          
When the enrollee has been sent to the employer for a short
period in order to determine whether the training received is adequate to enable
him or her to get and keep a job in the occupation.</p><p>(f)           
Job Corps enrollees also engage in on-site work experience, in
connection with the conservation and development of natural resources and
public recreational areas usually in conservation centers, and in performing
other tasks at the center itself. No such work performed by enrollees inures to
the benefit of the contractor who provides the training program and WH will not
assert that these activities are considered as work for an employer within the
coverage of the Act. Similarly, classroom activities whether or not resulting
in a useful product would be part of or incidental to the vocational training
program.</p><p>(g)           
In determining the wages paid employees described in (c) above
the joint employers may include the reasonable cost of such items as food,
lodging, clothing, laundry, transportation to and from work, and medical and
dental care in accordance with Reg 531. The reasonable cost of providing an
employee with medical and dental care may be based on the average of the costs
actually incurred for all employees over a representative period.</p><p>(h)          
In a Job Corps center (or camp) operated by a private employer,
the above principles in no way affect the application of the FLSA or SCA or PCA
to the employer’s own employees or employees of any subcontractors involved.

            <h3>10b23 - School employees - after hours work.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
In some cases school employees will work outside of their normal
working hours where a third party (either public or private) uses the school
facilities. For example, a community organization may use the school cafeteria
for a banquet or the auditorium for a concert, and the food service or
custodial employees of the school will perform the necessary services. Time
spent in the operation of a school and the maintenance of school property, both
during and after regular school hours is normally considered hours worked under
the Act. School employees engaged in the operation and maintenance of school
facilities during periods in which their services are made available to a third
party are considered to be jointly employed by the school and the third party
if the school itself contracts for the use of such employees. The total time
spent in work for the joint employers will be counted as hours worked and paid
for in compliance with the MW and OT pay provisions of the Act.</p><p>(b)           
If the school does not require that its employees be utilized by
nonschool organizations when using school facilities but such employees are
hired merely for the convenience of the outside group and are paid directly by
them, the hours worked and compensation paid to such employees for this time
need not be included in determining compensation due to the employee for their
employment by the school.</p>

            <h3>10b24 - University or college students.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
University or college students who participate in activities
generally recognized as extracurricular are generally not considered to be
employees within the meaning of the Act. In addition to the examples listed in
FOH 10b03(e), students serving as residence hall assistants or dormitory
counselors, who are participants in a bona fide educational program, and who
receive remuneration in the form of reduced room or board charges, free use of
telephones, tuition credits, and the like, are not employees under the Act.</p><p>(b)           
On the other hand, an employment relationship will generally
exist with regard to students whose duties are not part of an overall educational
program and who receive some compensation. Thus, for example, students who work
at food service counters or sell programs or usher at athletic events, or who
wait on tables or wash dishes in dormitories in anticipation of some
compensation (money, meals etc.) are generally considered employees under the
Act.</p>

            <h3>10b25  - Fraternal orders - officers and volunteers.</h3>
            <p>WH will not
assert that an employment relationship exists under the Act for persons who
volunteer their services, including those who are elected, to a fraternal order
not as employees and without contemplation of pay. Included would be such
persons as the secretary and director or trustees of individual lodges. The
payment of a nominal sum would not affect the status of a bona fide volunteer.

            <h3>10b26 - School related work programs.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Pursuant to the provisions of Sec 14(d) of the FLSA, WH will take
no enforcement action with respect to MW or OT for public or  private
elementary or secondary students employed by any school in their school
district in various school-related work programs, provided, that such
employment is in compliance with applicable CL provisions. This position is
adopted without prejudice to the rights of individual employees under Sec
16(b). This non-enforcement policy is not applicable to workers with
disabilities in sheltered workshops operated by elementary or secondary schools
since sheltered employment is not considered to be an integral part of a
regular education program.</p><p>(b)           
If such employment is not in compliance with applicable CL
provisions, the students so employed must be paid MW and OT for all hours
worked in any w/w in which they were so employed. Also, the employer will be
subject to CL/CMP’s.</p>

            <h3>10b27 - Prison inmates.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Generally, a prison inmate who, while serving a sentence, is
required to work by or who does work for the prison, within the confines of the
institution, on prison farms, roadgangs, or other areas directly associated
with the incarceration program, is not an employee within the meaning of the
Act (See also FOH 10b03(g)).</p><p>(b)           
A different situation exists, however, where inmates are
contracted out by an institution to a private company or individual. In such
instances an employee-employer relationship is created between the private company
or individual and the prisoners. This is true regardless of whether the work is
performed within the confines of the institution or elsewhere.</p>

governmental agencies operate social service programs which arrange for and
finance the rearing of children by foster parents. No employment relationship
will be deemed to exist where:</p><p>(1)          
State or licensed private agency selects an individual who
voluntarily agrees to become a foster parent in accordance with State
standards, and</p><p>(2)          
the foster parent services are provided in the foster parent’s

Services Act of 1973.</h3>
            <p>(a)        “Foster
Grandparent” and “Senior Companion” programs.</p><p>Volunteers
participating in either the “Foster Grandparent” or “Senior Companion” programs
under the Domestic Volunteer Services Act of 1973, are not employees under the
FLSA.</p><p>(b)           
“University Year for Action” (UYA) programs.</p><p>(1)          
Situations may be encountered where a university has established
a federally-funded “University Year for ACTION” (UYA) service learning program
pursuant to the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (DVSA). These programs
provide that students will receive college credits when they volunteer to
perform various services, often for a nonprofit private organization, on a
full-time basis for a year. The students receive a subsistence-level stipend to
cover their expenses, and they are required to live at the low income level of
the people they serve. The legislative history of the DVSA and the FLSA make
clear that these students are not considered employees for purposes of the
FLSA.</p><p>(2)          
Universities which receive federal “University Year ACTION” funds
have a five-year funding limit, but are required to make every effort to
continue the program after federal funds cease. Under such UYA continuation
programs, the students generally receive college credit, pay tuition, receive a
stipend, keep a journal of their experiences, make presentations of their work
and learning, and present periodic written reports of their progress in
achieving the program’s objectives. In addition, the sponsor, ordinarily a
faculty member, evaluates their internship performance.</p><p>(3)          
Where a UYA continuation program meets this description, WH will
not assert that an employment relationship exists. However, where programs are
encountered which differ materially from the above described circumstances,
obtain all the facts of the case and refer the file to the NO/OEP, ATTN: FLSA

            <h3>10b31 - Government activities - volunteer services.</h3>
            <p>The
principles in FOH 10b03(c) may apply with respect to certain governmental
activities. For example, an office employee of the city may volunteer to
perform nonclerical services, such as coaching a softball or basketball team in
a city-sponsored program during his or her off-duty time as a charitable or
civil act. Similarly a person may participate in the civil defense program for
civil or personal motives. Where a person performs such volunteer services
without promise or expectation of compensation, at hours that suit his or her
own convenience whether by schedule or otherwise, and where no regular employee
is replaced in the performance of normal duties, no employer-employee
relationship exists with respect to such time. The activity may be performed on
the employer’s premises so long as it is not done during any time the employee
is required to be on the premises and the control exercised by the employer is
only minimal. A person, however, may not be both an employee and a volunteer
while performing essentially the same duties. Thus, for example, a person
employed in park activities cannot have his or her time divided into “working
hours” and “volunteer hours” while performing the same or related duties.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10b32"></div>
            <h3>10b32 - Government-financed child care services.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Whether individuals who provide child care services in their own
homes under an agreement with a government social service agency are employees
of such agency would depend upon the total fact situation involved in the
arrangement. If the parent (or person standing in the place of a parent) is
free to select, and in fact does select, an individual from a list of persons
supplied by the agency as qualified to perform the child care services, with
the agency merely agreeing to reimburse the child care “operator” selected, an
employee-employer relationship would not exist between the government agency
and the operator. Further, if the agency utilizes bona fide volunteers as day
care operators over whom no control is exercised, and the monetary payment is
simply to reimburse the operator for expenses, no employment relationship would
exist. However, the activities of such day care homes may be covered under the
Act, and the operator responsible for compliance with respect to any employees
employed in connection with the operation of the child care center. (See also
FOH 12g00.)</p><p>(b)           
Conversely, if in fact such freedom of choice does not exist, and
the parent is told to which home the child must be taken for this service, and
the agency is closely involved in directing and controlling the operator in
performing the duties in rendering the child care services, an
employee-employer relationship would exist between the agency and the operator.</p>

            <p>WH will take

            <h3>10b34 - Patient workers.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
The court has held that patient workers in hospitals or
institutions whose work is of any consequential economic benefit to the
facility are to be treated as employees. While the court has generally
considered all circumstances in determining whether an employment relationship
existed, the court specifically rejected as determinative the alleged
therapeutic value of the work or the patient’s level of performance. In
general, we would hold that there is consequential economic benefit to the
institution if the work in question would be performed by someone else if it
were not done by the patient. However, where a patient is undergoing evaluation
or training, we will not hold the patient to be an employee during the first
three months of engagement in a work activity or activities provided the
patient spends no more than one hour a day and no more than 5 hours a week in
such activities and provided further that competent instruction and supervision
is provided the patient during such period.</p><p>(b)           
A patient in a hospital or institution may volunteer and need not
be considered an employee for such services which would not be compensated by
the institution if performed by a person other than a patient. Such volunteer
services may include wheeling another patient in a wheelchair to and from
certain activities, planting a vegetable garden if the fruits of such labor
belong to the patient, and other similar activities. However, the ordinary
maintenance, patient care, office work and other activities that are performed
in the operation of an institution would create an employment relationship.</p>

programs.</h3>
            <p>There
are certain types of situations in residential drug abuse and alcohol treatment
programs where an employment relationship would not be deemed to exist. For
example, a residential care program which seeks to establish a “family setting”
for treatment of persons with drug or alcohol problems would not create an
employment relationship under the Act between the residents and the institution
where:</p><p>(1)          
The work performed by the residents is that which is ordinarily
done on a daily basis in a private home and is solely for the mutual benefit of
the occupants of the home (institution);</p><p>(2)          
Residents do not perform work activities which would ordinarily
be performed by full-time employees of the institution so that there is no
displacement of regular full-time employees through substitution of resident
workers;</p><p>(3)          
Residence in the institution and performance of activities by the
occupants is short-term (usual no more than a year) as opposed to generally
long term occupancy in such institutions as those concerned with the mentally
ill, the mentally retarded, the aged, or the terminally ill;</p><p>(4)          
The institution is relatively small, houses a limited number of
residents, and has no paid staff other than counselors.</p>

            <h3>10b36 - Veterans making artificial poppies.</h3>
            <p>It has long
been the practice in VA hospitals to have disabled veterans make artificial
poppies that are dispensed on street corners by the Veterans of Foreign Wars
and the American Legion. Whether these veterans are performing this work as
“employees” would depend on the fact in each case. However, in view of VA’s
involvement, WH will not handle complaints or investigate in this area but will
refer such matters to the VA.</p>

            <h3>10b37 - Pharmaceutical externs and interns.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Colleges and universities which offer degree programs in pharmacy
may require clinical or work experience at a pharmacy site. These “externship”
courses combine classroom lectures and lab work with on-site work training
under the supervision of a qualified pharmacist. Participation by students in
such extern courses as part of their pharmacy curriculum is predominantly for
their benefit and in furtherance of their educational opportunities. In some
States completion of such courses may reduce the postgraduation and
prelicensing “internship” requirements, thus enabling the students to become
licensed in a shorter time. Therefore, WH will not assert that an employment
relationship exists because of such work training.</p><p>(b)           
The States generally have a requirement that graduates of a
pharmacy degree program must serve as an apprentice or intern for up to a year
prior to licensure. However, where such individuals are serving in a
postgraduation internship, an employment relationship would exist between the
graduate interns and the pharmacies at which they work prior to licensing.</p>

            <p>An alcoholic
admitted to a SWS frequently requires a “drying out” period before he/she is
capable of performing work. The alcoholic’s presence in the SWS during this
period is primarily intended to keep him/her away form alcohol and not to
perform any significant productive work. Consequently, WH will not assert that
an employment relationship exists in the case of an individual who is
substantiated to be an alcoholic (see FOH 64f09) during the first four weeks
(28 consecutive calendar days) in the SWS unless it is clearly evident that the
individual has been engaged in activities which provide consequential service

            <h3>10b40 - Welfare/workfare programs.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
More and more States are adopting welfare/workfare programs, i.e.
programs that require persons to perform work in some capacity in exchange for
receiving welfare assistance. These programs need to be carefully examined to
determine if an employer - employee relationship subject to FLSA exists. If the
welfare recipient is an employee subject to FLSA, the following facts must be
determined:</p><p>(1)          
Does the State welfare/workfare statute grant the State authority
to require the welfare recipient to work for their assistance?</p><p>(2)          
What hours of work are required of welfare recipients and are
records kept of those work hours?</p><p>(3)          
Does the welfare assistance (cash/benefits) provide a wage of not
less than the applicable MW and proper payment of OT when worked?</p><p>(4)          
Are recipients employed in violation of the child labor
provisions?</p><p>(b)           
If FLSA violations exist, potential BW and CMP liability should
be determined, and copies of documentation supporting the facts obtained above,
forwarded to the AA/OPO for review prior to any discussion with State
authorities regarding FLSA compliance. After this review, the AA/OPO will
advise the RO on how to proceed.</p>

Sec 3(d) of the amended Act defines “employer” to include “… any
person acting... in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee and
includes a public agency...” and Sec 3(a) defines “person” to mean “.. an
individual, partnership, association, corporation, business trust, legal
representative, or any organized group of persons”. Thus, by interpolation of
the definition of  “person” into the definition of “employer”, the scope of the
term “employer” becomes apparent.</p><p>(b)           
Sec 3(x) of the amended Act defines “public agency” to mean the
Government of the United States; the government of a State or political
subdivision thereof; any agency of the United States (including the United
States Postal Service and Postal Rate Commission), a State, or a political
subdivision of a State; or any interstate governmental agency.</p>

            <p>A
partnership is a “person” for purposes of the FLSA, and may be a party to the
employment relationship as an employer. The employment relationship is not
considered to exist between a bona fide partnership and the partners of whom it
is composed. Such partners are self-employed, since they cannot be said to be
employed by an employer separate and distinct from themselves. Merely calling
individuals who are essentially employees by the term “partners” under a
so-called partnership agreement, which fails to invest them with the usual
attributes of partnership in an enterprise, does not make them such.</p>

            <p>The FLSA
contains nothing to indicate that cooperative organizations, as such, are to be
excluded form the category of employers subject to its terms. It is clear that
the employment relationship may exist at least between such an organization and
non-members whom it hires or suffers or permits to work. Nor can it be said
that membership in a cooperative in the ordinary case establishes a mutual
agency analogous to a partnership or otherwise identifies the member so closely
with the cooperative that they cannot become, respectively, employer and
employee. Among the circumstances which may be taken to indicate that a
cooperative is an entity separate and distinct from its worker-members, are a
corporate form of organization, the presence of the usual incidents of the
employment relationship (for example, control by the governing body or a
designated officer over the work performed, the member’s hours of labor,
selection for and discharge from the job and the like) and the exercise of
financial or managerial control or the furnishing of capital or management
services by outsiders, especially if such outsiders are wholesalers, manufacturers,
or others who purchase or dispose of the products of the cooperatives.</p>

            <p>A
corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its stockholders. In
the ordinary case, a corporation and a stockholder therein can become parties
to the employment relationship as employer and employee, and a worker who is,
in other respects, in the position of an employee of a corporation must be
treated as such for the purposes of the FLSA, even though the worker owns
shares of stock in his or her corporate employer. Ownership of stock does not
destroy the duality of the parties to the relationship, even where the worker
is an officer of the corporation or where none but stockholders do the
corporation’s work.</p>

            <h3>10c04 - Excluded employers.</h3>
            <p>The term
“employer”, as used In Sec 3(d) of the FLSA, “does not include any labor
organization (other than when acting as an employer) or anyone acting in the
capacity of officer or agent of such labor organization.” The qualifying
phrase, “other than when acting as an employer”, indicates observance of the
FLSA with respect to any individuals directly employed by it, whether or not
such individuals are members of the organization, and even though they are
elected to their positions by the entire membership.</p>

            <h3>10c05 - Political subdivisions of a State.</h3>
            <p>The
determination of whether a particular body is a “political subdivision” of a
State within the meaning of FLSA Sec 3(d) must be controlled by the intention
of Congress. In general, the term “political subdivision” is interpreted for
purposes of the FLSA to include counties, townships, cities, towns, villages,
school districts, drainage districts, etc.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10c06"></div>
            <h3>10c06 - Status of contractors with a government.</h3>
            <p>The fact
that an employer is doing work for the Federal Government or a State Government
does not transform the employer into a government instrumentality, nor place
him/her in the position of the “United States or any State or political
subdivision of a State.” Not even the fact that the Federal or a State
Government has contracted for the performance by a private employer of a
function purely governmental in character is sufficient to make the government
the employer of the individuals employed by the contractor to perform the
function.</p>

            <h3>10c07 - Federal Reserve Bank employees.</h3>

Sec 3(d).</p>

            <h3>10c08 - Farm Credit Administration Banks and
Associations.</h3>
            <p>Employees of
the following Farm Credit Administration Banks and Associations are considered
as “employees” within the meaning of FLSA and subject to its provisions in the
same manner as employees of the ordinary commercial bank or credit
establishment:  Federal Land Banks, Federal Land Bank Associations, Federal
Intermediate Credit Banks, Production Credit Associations and Banks for
Cooperatives.</p>

            <h3>10c09 - Status of State-sponsored workshops.</h3>
            <p>A
State-sponsored workshop or other institution for aid to the handicapped may or
may not be considered the same as the State, depending on the facts concerning
the establishment and operation of the particular institution. Employment in a
State workshop for the blind is considered to be employment by the State itself
where:</p><p>(1)          
The institution was founded by an act of the legislature for the
purpose of providing a central and responsible State unit to administer relief
to the blind;</p><p>(2)          
the financial operations of the institution were audited by a
fiscal officer of the State; and</p><p>(3)          
its identity with the State was further established by statutory
provisions vesting supervision and control in a board of trustees, of whom a
majority were appointed by the Governor, and providing for the financing of the
institution out of public funds.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10c10"></div>
            <h3>10c10 - Status of foreign governments.</h3>
            <p>Although the
FLSA does not expressly exclude foreign governments from the category of
employers subject to its provisions, the usual principles of international
comity are applied to exclude the direct agencies of such governments from
compliance with the Act. This rule, however, applies only if the agency is
exercising part of the sovereign power of the foreign government. If the agency
is a commercial one engaged in commercial operations in competition with
American industries, the agency is not excluded under this principle and the
employees are entitled to the benefits of the FLSA. The United Nations is in
the same category as a foreign government.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10c11"></div>
            <h3>10c11 - States and political subdivisions - single
employers.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
The government of a State, that is, all the departments and
agencies of any of the 50 States, constitutes a single employer under the Act.
Similarly, the government of a political subdivision, e.g., county, city, etc.,
with all of its departments and agencies, constitutes a single employer under
the Act. However, such entities are separate and distinct from the government
of the State and from other political subdivisions. Thus, for example, where an
employee works for more than one agency of the State government, or for more
than one agency of a political subdivision, such employee’s employment is by a
single employer. Each agency is both individually and coequally responsible for
compliance with all applicable provisions of the Act with respect to such employee.
However, see FOH 59d.</p><p>(b)           
Political subdivisions (see FOH 10c05) and interstate agencies
have traditionally been recognized as entities separate and distinct from the
government of the State.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10c12"></div>
            <h3>10c12 - Community action agency.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Public agencies.</p><p>(1)          
Whether a community action agency, which administers various
antipoverty and economic opportunity programs, is a covered employer under the
FLSA depends upon the facts in a particular situation. Any community action
agency which is an entity of a State, a political subdivision of a State, or a
combination of public agencies is clearly an employer covered under the Act.
(See Secs 3(d) and 3(x) and FOH 10c05.)</p><p>(2)          
However, a community action agency which consists solely of a
private nonprofit agency or organization that has been designated by the State
(or political subdivision thereof) would not thereby become a “public agency”.
This does not, of course, preclude coverage of such private community action
agency under another provision of the FLSA. A private community action agency
does not become a “public agency” merely because it receives and disburses
Federal funds. However, see FOH 59d.</p><p>(b)           
Enterprise coverage.</p><p>Enterprise
coverage does not apply to the charitable, educational, religious or similar
activities of private nonprofit organizations except where such activities are
performed in connection with the type of institution set out in Sec 3(s)(1) of
the Act or in connection with commercial ventures.</p><p>(c)           
“Individual” coverage.</p><p>Individual
coverage may apply to employees of such organizations.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="10d00"></div>
            <h3>10d00 - Scope of the term “employee”.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Sec 3(e)(1) of the amended Act defines the term “employee” to
include any individual employed by an employer, except as provided in Secs
3(e)(2), (3) and (4).</p><p>(b)           
Sec 3(e)(2) of the amended Act provides that in the case of an
individual employed by a public agency, the term “employee” means:</p><p>(1)          
any individual employed by the Government of the United States –</p><p>a.             
as a civilian in the military departments (as defined in section
102 of title 5, United States Code),</p><p>b.             
in any executive agency (as defined in section 105 of such
title),</p><p>c.             
in any unit of the legislative or judicial branch of the
Government which has positions in the competitive service,</p><p>d.             
in a nonappropriated fund instrumentality under the jurisdiction
of the Armed Forces, or</p><p>e.             
in the Library of Congress</p><p>(2)          
any individual employed by the United States Postal Service or
the Postal Rate Commission; and</p><p>(3)          
any individual employed by a State, political subdivision of a
State, or an interstate governmental agency, other than such an individual –</p><p>a.             
who is not subject to the civil service laws of the State,
political subdivision, or agency which employs him; and</p><p>b.             
who</p><p>1.             
holds a public elective office of that State, political
subdivision, or agency,</p><p>2.             
is selected by the holder of such an office to be a member of his
personal staff,</p><p>3.             
is appointed by such an office holder to serve on a policy-making
level, or</p><p>4.             
who is an immediate adviser to such an office holder with respect
to the constitutional or legal powers of his or her office, or</p><p>5.             
is an employee in the legislative branch or legislative body of
such State, political subdivision, or agency and is not employed by the
legislative library of such State, political subdivision, or agency</p><p>c.             
The first category (b. 1, above) is limited to those persons who
are elected by the voters of the pertinent jurisdiction.  With respect to the
second and third categories (b.2 and b.3, above) the following are examples of
tests which are to be considered:</p><p>1.             
Is the person’s employment entirely at the discretion of the
elected office holder?</p><p>2.             
Is the position not subject to approval or clearance by the
personnel department or division of any part of the government?</p><p>3.             
Is the work performed outside of any position or occupation
established by a table of organization as part of a legislative, executive, or
judicial branch, or a committee or commission established by such a branch?</p><p>4.             
Is the person’s compensation dependent upon a specific
appropriation or is it paid out of an office expense allowance provided to the
office holder? </p><p>The fourth
category (b.4, above) is limited to that of a legal advisor, i.e., a lawyer.</p><p>d.             
Thus individuals such as pages, stenographers, telephone
operators, clerks, typists and others employed by the branch or commission as a
whole, may be considered “employees” under the Act. An additional example would
be deputy sheriffs who, although they are selected by and work under the
direction of the sheriff, are employed only after approval of their employment
by the Board of Commissioners. They are not employed at the sole discretion of
the sheriff pursuant to the second (II, above) category.</p><p>(c)           
Of course, employees who are not excluded by the provisions of
Sec 3(e)(2)(C) may qualify for exemption under Reg 541 if the tests are met.</p><p>(d)           
Pursuant to section 3(e)(4) of the FLSA, the term “employee” does
not include any individual who volunteers to perform services for a public
agency which is a State, a political subdivision of a State, or an interstate
government agency, if-</p><p>(1)          
the individual receives no compensation or is paid expenses,
reasonable benefits, or a nominal fee to perform the services for which the
individual volunteered; and</p><p>(2)          
such services are not the same type of services which the
individual is employed to perform for such public agency.</p><p>(e)           
An employee of a public agency which is a State, political
subdivision of a State, or an interstate governmental agency may volunteer to
perform services for any other State, political subdivision, or interstate
governmental agency, including a State, political subdivision or agency with
which the employing State, political subdivision, or agency has a mutual aid
agreement.</p>

            <p>Pursuant to Sec 4(f) of the amended Act, the Secretary is
authorized to enter into an agreement with the Librarian of Congress for
enforcement of the FLSA with respect to any individual employed in the Library

Congress will investigate its own complaints.</p>

            <h3>10d02  - Employees of the United States.</h3>
            <p>Sec 4(f) of the amended Act authorizes the Civil Service
Commission (now the Office of Personnel Management) to administer the
provisions of the FLSA with respect to any individual employed by the U.S.
(other than an individual employed in the Library of Congress, United States
Postal Service, Postal Rate Commission, or the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p>

employees under Sec 16(b).</h3>
            <p>Sec 16(b) of the FLSA and Sec 6 of the Portal Act provide
that employees of a public agency may sue for BW’s in any Federal or State
court of competent jurisdiction for themselves or other employees.</p>

            <h3>10d04 - Member of the elected official’s personal
staff.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Sec 3(e)(2)(C) excludes from the definition of employee under the
FLSA individuals who are selected by an elected office holder to be a member of
his or her personal staff. The “personal staff” does not include individuals
who are directly supervised by someone other than the elected official even
though they may be selected by and serve at the pleasure of such official.</p><p>(b)           
Generally personal staff includes only persons who are under the
direct supervision of the elected official and who have almost daily contact
with him or her. It would, for example, include the official’s private
secretary, but not the secretary to his or her assistant, or the stenographers
in a pool that services the official’s department, or staff members in an
operational unit whose head reports to the elected official. It would typically
not include all members of an operational unit, since all the members could not
have a personal working relationship with the elected official.</p>

duties both in the U.S. and foreign countries such as Canada, Mexico, or

            <p>(a)           
Coverage shall be asserted for U.S. and foreign citizens employed
at or working out of an establishment or work site, located in a State, as
defined in the Act, even though the employer is a foreign citizen, when such
employees are engaged in or producing goods for interstate commerce or are
employed in an enterprise described in Sec 3(s).</p><p>(b)           
Employees employed by and working in an establishment located in
a foreign country are not considered subject to the FLSA merely because they make
deliveries in the States, or pick up materials in the States for transport to a
foreign country.</p><p>(c)           
On the other hand, where an employee of such an establishment is
working in the U.S. for a substantial period of time and performs covered,
nonexempt work, coverage would be asserted. A worker who travels more than 25
miles from the U.S. border or spends more than 72 hours in the U.S. on a single
visit (whichever occurs first) is considered to have spent a substantial period
of time in the U.S. Once a worker has spent a substantial period in the U.S.,
all hours of work in the U.S. on that visit must be compensated at no less than
the minimum wage, including hours of work prior to the worker reaching the 25
mile or 72 hour mark</p>
