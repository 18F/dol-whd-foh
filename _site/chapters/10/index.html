from the common law concept.</h3>
              <p>The courts
have made it clear that the employment relationship under the FLSA is broader
than the traditional common law concept of the master and servant relationship.
The difference between the FLSA employment relationship and the common law
employment relationship arises from the FLSA statement that “Employ includes to
suffer or permit to work”. The courts have indicated that, while “to permit”
requires a more positive action than “to suffer”, both terms imply much less
positive action than required by the common law. Mere knowledge by an employer
of work done for him or her by another is sufficient to create the employment
relationship under the FLSA.</p>

not negate his/her status as an employee, if other indications of employment
are present. If the worker is paid, the fact that he or she is paid by the

              <h3>10b03 - Religious, charitable, and nonprofit
organizations, schools institutions, volunteer workers, member of religious orders.</h3>
              <p>(a)           
There is no special provision in the FLSA which precludes an
employee-employer relationship between a religious, charitable or nonprofit
organization and persons who perform work for such an organization. For
example, a church or religious order may operate an establishment to print
books, magazines, or other publications and employ a regular staff who do this
work as a means of livelihood. In such cases there is an employee-employer
relationship for purposes of the Act.</p><p>(b)           
Persons such as nuns, monks, priests, lay brothers, ministers,
deacons, and other members of religious orders who serve pursuant to their
religious obligations in the schools, hospitals, and other institutions
operated by their church or religious order shall not be considered to be “employees”.
However, the fact that such a person is a member of a religious order does not
preclude an employee-employer relationship with a State or secular institution.</p><p>(c)           
In many cases the nature of religious, charitable and similar
nonprofit organizations, and schools is such that individuals may volunteer
their services in one capacity or another, usually on a part-time basis, not as
employees or in contemplation of pay for the services rendered. For example,
members of civic organizations may help out in a sheltered workshop; women’s
organizations may send members or students into hospitals or nursing homes to
provide certain personal services for the sick or the elderly; mothers may
assist in a school library or cafeteria as a public duty to maintain effective
services for their children; or fathers may drive a school bus to carry a
football team or band on a trip. Similarly, individuals may volunteer to
perform such tasks as driving vehicles or folding bandages for the Red Cross,
working with children with disabilities or disadvantaged youth, helping in
youth programs as camp counselors, scoutmasters, den mothers, providing child
care assistance for needy working mothers, soliciting contributions or
participating in benefit programs for such organizations and volunteering other
services needed to carry out their charitable, educational, or religious
programs. The fact that services are performed under such circumstances is not
sufficient to create an employee-employer relationship.</p><p>(d)           
Although the volunteer services (as described in (c) above) are
not considered to create an employment relationship, the organizations for
which they are performed will generally also have employees performing
compensated service whose employment is subject to the standards of the Act.
Where such an employment relationship exists, the Act requires payment of not
less than the statutory wages for all hours “worked” in the w/w. However, there
are certain circumstances where such an employee may donate services as a
volunteer, and the time so spent is not considered to be compensable “work”.
For example, an office employee of a hospital may volunteer to sit with a sick
child or elderly person during off-duty hours as an act of charity. WH will not
consider that an employee-employer relationship exists with respect to such
volunteer time between the establishment and the volunteer or between the
volunteer and the person for whose benefit the service is performed. Another
example is where an office employee of a church may volunteer to perform
non-clerical services in the church preschool during off duty time from his or
her office work as an act of charity. Conversely, a preschool employee may
volunteer to perform work in some other facet of the church’s operations
without an employment relationship being formed with respect to such volunteer
time. However, this does not mean that a regular office employee of a
charitable organization can volunteer services on an uncompensated basis to
handle correspondence in connection with a special fund drive or to handle
other work arising from exigencies of the operations conducted by the employer.</p><p>(e)           
As part of their overall educational program, public or private
schools and institutions of higher learning may permit or require students to
engage in activities in connection with dramatics, student publications, glee
clubs, bands, choirs, debating teams, radio stations, intramural and
interscholastic athletics and other similar endeavors. Activities of students
in such programs, conducted primarily for the benefit of the participants as a
part of the educational opportunities provided to the students by the school or
institution, are not “work” of the kind contemplated by Sec 3(g) of the Act and
do not result in an employee-employer relationship between the student and the
school or institution. Also, the fact that a student may receive a minimal
payment for participation is such activities would not necessarily create an
employment relationship.</p><p>(f)           
The sole fact that a student helps in a school lunchroom or
cafeteria for periods of 30 minutes to an hour per day in exchange for their
lunch is not considered to be sufficient to make him or her an employee of the
school, regardless of whether he or she performs such work regularly or only on
occasion. Also, the fact that students on occasion do some cleaning up of a
classroom, serve the school as junior patrol officers or perform minor clerical
work in the school office or library for periods of an hour per day or less
without contemplation of compensation or in exchange or a meal or for a cash
amount reasonably equivalent to the price of a meal or, when a cash amount is
given in addition to a meal, it is only a nominal sum, is not considered
sufficient in itself to characterize the students as employees of the school. A
similar policy will be followed where the students perform such tasks less
frequently but for a full day, with an arrangement to perform their academic
work for such days at other times. For example, the students may perform
full-day cafeteria service four times per year. In such cases, the time devoted
to cafeteria work in the aggregate would be less than if the student worked an
hour per day. However, if there are other indicia of employment or the students
normally devote more than an hour each day or equivalent to such work, the
circumstances of the arrangement should be reviewed carefully.</p><p>(g)           
In the ordinary case, tasks performed as a normal part of a
program of treatment, rehabilitation, or vocational training in the following
situations will not be considered, under Sec 3(g) of the Act, as “work” of a
kind requiring a hospital patient, school student, or institutional inmate to
be considered an employee of the hospital, school, or institution conducting
the program, for purposes of the FLSA: tasks performed by individuals committed
to training schools of a correctional nature, which are required as a part of
the correctional program of the institution as a part of the institutional
discipline and by reason of their value in providing needed therapy,
rehabilitation, or training to help prepare the inmate to become
self-sustaining in a lawful occupation after release</p><p>(h)          
WH will not assert that initial participation by a student with
disabilities in a school-work program constitutes an employment relationship if
certain conditions are met. However, after an employment relationship has
developed, the provisions of the Act will be applicable.</p><p>(i)            
The conditions under which an employment relationship initially
will not be asserted are:</p><p>(1)          
The activities are basically educational, are conducted primarily
for the benefit of the participants, and comprise one of the facets of the
educational opportunities provided to the students. The student may receive
some payment for their work in order to have a more realistic work situation,
or as an incentive to the student or to insure that the employer will treat the
student as a worker.</p><p>(2)          
The time in attendance at the school plus the time in attendance
at the experience station (either in the school or with an outside employer)
does not substantially exceed the time the student would be required to attend
school if following a normal academic schedule. Time in excess of 1 hour beyond
the normal school schedule or attendance at the experience station on days when
school is not in session would be considered substantial.</p><p>(j)            
The student does not displace a regular employee or impair the
employment opportunities of others by performing work which would otherwise be
performed by regular employees who would be employed by the school or an
independent contractor including, for example, employees of a contractor
operating the food service facilities at the school.</p><p>(k)          
The shift to an employment relationship may occur shortly after
the placement or it may occur later. As a general guide, work for a particular
employer, either a private employer or the school, after 3 months will be
assumed by WH to be part of an employment relationship unless the facts
indicate that the training situation has not materially changed. Thus, if the
conditions which warranted the finding that the student is not considered an
employee continue, he or she may remain for a period of time as a trainee
rather than an employee. On the other hand, if after the 3-month period the
training aspects are subordinated and the work aspects clearly predominate, the
student will be considered as an employee.</p>

When did the practice of buying and selling between the employer
and the homeworker begin, and what are the mechanics of the transaction?</p><p>(6)          
Does the homeworker bill the employer for the work done? Are
bills of sale prepared? Are sales taxes paid, or are State or local exemptions
obtained because of retail purposes? Are payments made in cash or by check?</p><p>(7)          
How does the homeworker’s profit under the buying-selling

              <h3>10b05 - Test of the employment
relationship.</h3>
              <p>(a)           
The principal test relied upon by the courts for determining
whether an employment relationship exists has been whether the possible
employer controls or has the right to control the work to be done by the
possible employee to the extent of prescribing how the work shall be performed.
Additional considerations are the method of payment and how free the possible
employer is to replace the possible employee with another. However, the Supreme
Court has said that there is “no definition that solves all problems as to the
limitations of the employer-employee relationship” under the FLSA. A determination
of the relationship cannot be based on “isolated factors” or upon a single
characteristic “but rather upon the circumstances of the whole activity”</p><p>(b)           
The factors which the Supreme Court has considered significant,
although no single one is regarded as controlling, are:</p><p>(1)          
the extent to which the services in question are an integral part
of the employer’s business;</p><p>(2)          
the amount of the alleged contractor’s investment in facilities
and equipment;</p><p>(3)          
the alleged contractor’s opportunities for profit and loss; and,</p><p>(4)          
the amount of initiative, judgment, or foresight in open market
competition with others required for the success of the claimed independent
enterprise.</p>

              <h3>10b06 - Amount of control.</h3>
              <p>(a)           
Where the facts clearly establish that the possible employee is
the subordinate party, the relationship is one of employment. To determine the
amount of control consider:</p><p>(1)          
whether there are restrictive provisions in the contract between
the possible employer and possible employee which require that the work must be
satisfactory to the possible employer and detailing, or giving the possible
employer the right to detail, how the work is to be performed;</p><p>(2)          
whether the possible employer has control over the business of
the person performing work for them, even though the possible employer does not
control the particular circumstances of the work;</p><p>(3)          
whether the contract is for an indefinite period or for a
relatively long period;</p><p>(4)          
whether the possible employer may discharge employees of the
alleged independent contractor;</p><p>(5)          
whether the possible employer may cancel the contract at their
discretion, and on how much notice;</p><p>(6)          
whether the work done by the alleged independent contractor is
the same or similar to that done by admitted employees.</p>

              <h3>10b07 - Other considerations.</h3>
              <p>(a)           
Since the determination of whether an employment relationship
exists depends “upon the circumstances of the whole activity”, particular
factors to be considered are:</p><p>(1)          
Is the alleged independent contractor listed on the payroll with
the appropriate tax deductions, or are the payments to them charged to the
labor and salary account or selling expense account instead of to the account
to which attorney’s fees, auditor’s fees, and the like, are charged?</p><p>(2)          
Must employees of the alleged independent contractor be approved
by the possible employer?</p><p>(3)          
Does the possible employer keep the books and prepare the payroll
for the possible employee?</p><p>(4)          
Is the alleged independent contractor assigned to a particular
territory without freedom of movement outside thereof?</p><p>(5)          
Does the alleged independent contractor have an independent
economic or other interest in their work, other than increasing their own pay?</p><p>(6)          
How do the respective tax returns of the parties list the
remuneration paid?</p><p>(b)           
If the possible employer has control over the manner in which the
work is to be performed, the absence of any or all of the foregoing factors
will not indicate an absence of the employer-employee relationship. However,
where the element of control cannot be firmly established, they will help in
determining whether the relationship is one of employer and employee or of
independent contractors.</p><p>(c)           
The following factors are immaterial to the determination of
whether the relationship is one of employer-employee or of independent contractors:</p><p>(1)          
the State or local government grants a license to the alleged
independent contractor;</p><p>(2)          
the measurement, method, or designation of compensation;</p><p>(3)          
the fact that no compensation is paid and the alleged independent
contractor must rely entirely on tips;</p><p>(4)          
the place where the work is performed;</p><p>(5)          
the absence of a formal employment agreement. </p>

              <h3>10b08 - Effect of “sale” on the employment
relationship.</h3>
              <p>(a)           
An employment relationship may exist between the parties to a
transaction which is nominally a “sale” Thus, house-to-house canvassers who
sell at retail the products of a particular company are employees of the
company, although their contracts with the company are in the form of “dealer”
contracts under which the company purports to “sell” its products to them at
fixed wholesale prices and to “recommend” retail prices at which the products
should be sold, where the control exercised by the company over the so-called
“dealers” is not substantially different than that exercised by an employer
over their outside salesmen.</p><p>(b)           
Likewise, an employee is not converted into an independent
contractor by virtue of a fictitious “sale” of the goods produced by him or her
to an employer, so long as the other indications of the employment relationship
exist. Homeworkers who “sell” their products to a manufacturer are his or her
employees where the control exercised by the manufacturer over the homeworkers
through their ability to reject or refuse to “buy” the product is not
essentially different from the control ordinarily exercised by a manufacturer
over employees performing work for him or her at home on a piece rate basis.</p>

              <p>(a)           
The subject-matter of the employment relationship must be work or
its equivalent. The Supreme Court has set forth the essential elements of work
as:</p><p>(1)          
physical or mental exertion (whether burdensome or not);</p><p>(2)          
controlled or required by the employer; and,</p><p>(3)          
pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer
and his or her business.</p><p>(b)           
An essential element of work is not only that the employer
receives certain benefits from the services of the alleged employees but that
“the work necessarily or primarily benefits the company”.</p>

relationship.</h3>
              <p>(a)           
Once it is determined that one who is reputedly an independent
contractor, lessee, partner, or the like, is in fact an employee, then all the
employees of this so-called independent contractor engaged in the work for the
principal employer likewise become the employees of the principal employer, who
must guarantee compliance with the FLSA. Thus, the one who is responsible will
be charged with seeing to compliance with the FLSA and must keep the records of
the employees.</p><p>(b)           
However, a manufacturer or producer may undertake to see to it
that a true independent contractor complies with the FLSA, in order to avoid
interference with the manufacturer’s own operations through “hot goods” action
under FLSA Sec. 15(a)(1). Such an arrangement does not make the manufacturer or
producer the employer.</p>

the training, even though it includes actual operation of the
facilities of the employer, is similar to that which would be given in a
vocational school;</p><p>(2)          
the training is for the benefit of the trainees or students;</p><p>(3)          
the trainees or students do not displace regular employees, but
work under their close observation;</p><p>(4)          
the employer that provides the training derives no immediate
advantages from the activities of the trainees or students, and on occasion
operations may actually be impeded;</p><p>(5)          
the trainees or students are not necessarily entitled to a job at
the conclusion of the training period; and,</p><p>(6)

outside of training hours.</p><p>(c)           
Where the employees of the establishment are involved as either
instructors or trainees, particular care shall be taken to determine whether
there exists in actual fact an employment relationship, between the employer
being investigated and the employees involved, during the hours devoted
exclusively to the training program. The fact that the employer’s facilities
are utilized in the training program is not determinative of the existence of
an employment relationship between the employer and trainees or instructors
involved insofar as the hours devoted exclusively to such training is
concerned. Nor is the fact that the training program is directly related to the
employees’ regular jobs in itself controlling where, as may be the case, the
program is an independent training course conducted by the agency from which
both employees and the employer benefit. (See FOH 10b11 and IB Part 785.27

where training programs of the general type described are encountered. The
existence of an employment relationship during training periods is of
particular significance since an employee may be subject to FLSA by virtue of
employment in a covered enterprise even though not engaged in or producing
goods for interstate commerce.</p>

occupations - nurses, x-ray technicians, etc.</h3>
              <p>(a)           
Whether a student training for certain paramedical occupations is
viewed as an employee of a hospital within the meaning of the Act will depend
upon all the circumstances of the student’s activities on the premises of the
establishment. Where a bona fide student training program exists for such
paramedical occupations, and such program meets the criteria in Sec 10b11, no
employment relationship will be deemed to exist. Generally this involves
students training for such occupations as registered nurse, licensed vocational
or practical nurse, x-ray technician, certified laboratory assistant, or any
other skilled paramedical position. Such programs involve on-the-job training
combined with extensive classroom lectures and laboratory instruction generally
resulting in students receiving degrees, licensing, registration, or
certification by an appropriate board or society. The mere payment of a
scholarship, stipend, or allowance (as long as it does not exceed a reasonable
approximation of the expenses incurred by the trainee taking the course or
where it serves as an allowance for subsistence) will not be considered to
establish an employment relationship.</p><p>(b)           
Situations may be encountered where such a student will work in
the hospital for compensation outside of the training schedule. In the typical
case a student may do office or switchboard work. In such cases the student
will be considered an employee during the time spent on such work and must be
paid in compliance with the Act’s requirements for such time. However, the fact
that the student would be considered an employee during such time would not
require the time spent in activities described in (a) above to be counted as
hours worked.</p><p>(c)           
On the other hand, the principles in (a) above do not include
certain training programs such as those conducted for nurses aides and
orderlies where much of the training consists of on-the-job training and work
experience with little if any related classroom lectures or laboratory
instructions and which ordinarily do not lead to licensing, registration or
certification. In many cases these programs exist only for the purpose of
filling existing vacancies on the hospital staff. In such cases the students
would be considered employees of the hospital. In this regard any time spent in
the classroom or attending lectures would not be considered hours worked.</p>

and nursing homes.</h3>
              <p>(a)           
In some cases a special duty nurse or “sitter” may be employed to
care for a patient in a hospital or nursing home. Whether the employee is employed
by the patient or by the hospital or nursing home is a question of fact. For
example, if the hospital or nursing home determines whether use of a special
duty nurse or “sitter” will be permitted, what the pay is to be (even though
paid directly by the patient), and decides which special duty nurse or “sitter”
will be assigned to a particular patient, the hospital or nursing home is
considered to be the employer.</p><p>(b)           
On the other hand, if the patient or their representative
contracts directly with the special duty nurse or “sitter” as to pay, hours of
work and other working conditions, and the establishment does not control or
supervise such work, an employment relationship does not exist between the
special duty nurse or “sitter” and the establishment. This same principle will
apply to a nurse or other employee on the hospital or nursing home staff who is
employed during her off-duty hours as a special duty nurse or “sitter” by a
patient in the establishment. During the period or periods in which the employee
is so engaged on this special duty by the patient, WH will consider the
employment relationship as with the patient and not with the hospital or
nursing home.</p><p>(c)           
A special duty nurse or “sitter” who is employed by the patient
to care for such patient in a hospital or nursing home, as described in (b)
above, is not employed “in connection with the operation of” the hospital or
nursing home (see Sec 3(r)). The employment is in the nursing home or hospital
only because the patient is there and the work is not connected “with the
operation of” the hospital or nursing home as such.</p>

identified in the industry as “area correspondents” or “stringers”. These
writers ordinarily select their own materials which they obtain in the course

stories submitted and accepted by the newspaper. The arrangements vary but
traditionally the newspapers have considered these people to be in the same

the course of obtaining advanced degrees and the research is performed under

assigned to one of the hospital’s major areas of post-graduate training, such

under the immediate supervision of licensed physicians and also attend
conferences, teaching rounds, and classroom exercises. The program is designed

Some college graduate school programs provide that candidates for
the degree of Master of Hospital Administration (sometimes identified as Master
of Business Administration, Master of Arts, Master of Public Health, etc.) must
serve a certain period (often 12 months) of administrative residency in a
hospital. The candidates continue as students on the rolls of the college. In
the usual case, the hospital administrator responsible for the resident is also
on the college faculty. The resident performs various tasks in the hospital,
and generally prepares a thesis or various reports to the college concerning
hospital administration. The resident may receive a stipend or allowance from
the hospital. Pending interpretation by the courts, WH for purposes of

              <h3>10b22  - Job Corps enrollees.</h3>
              <p>(a)           
The Job Corps is a residential program for youths between 16 and
21 years of age established under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as
amended. Enrollees live in a Job Corps center (or camp) which is operated by
either a governmental organization or a private organization, in either case
supervised by a Federal Agency. Under Sec 107(a) of this Act, the Director of
the Job Corps is authorized to “provide or arrange for the provision of
programs of useful work experience and other appropriate activities for
enrollees”.</p><p>(b)           
In implementing this provision, the Job Corps has made
arrangements for the enrollees to work in private firms where they may perform
work covered by the FLSA. Such arrangements with private employers are usually
for part-time work and the average duration is four months. In such work
experience programs, supervision over the enrollees is maintained in order to
monitor their progress and maximize the quality of training given them.
Arrangements are made between the Job Corps and the private employer-trainer
regarding the division of training costs and the payment of wages.</p><p>(c)           
If a Job Corps enrollee performs work subject to the FLSA in a private
firm in such a work experience program he would be considered for purposes of
the FLSA to be jointly employed by the corporation operating the center or camp
and the private employer. Wages paid to enrollees by either of the joint
employers will be considered in determining compliance with the Act.</p><p>(d)           
It is the position of Wage-Hour that where such an enrollee is
assigned to receive training and work experience with a private employer in an
off-the-center work site, the following activities will not create an
employee-employer relationship:</p><p>(1)          
In the preliminary stages of work experience, when the enrollee
has had little or no previous training in the occupation and does no useful
work, but is merely being acquainted with the employer’s business.</p><p>(2)          
Time spent by the enrollee in a classroom situation in which no
useful work is performed.</p><p>(e)           
The following activities will generally create an
employee-employer relationship assuming productive work is performed:</p><p>(1)          
When an enrollee has been sent to the employer for a short period
in order to determine his or her aptitude and interest in an occupation
preliminary to giving training.</p><p>(2)          
When the enrollee has been sent to the employer for a short
period in order to determine whether the training received is adequate to enable
him or her to get and keep a job in the occupation.</p><p>(f)           
Job Corps enrollees also engage in on-site work experience, in
connection with the conservation and development of natural resources and
public recreational areas usually in conservation centers, and in performing
other tasks at the center itself. No such work performed by enrollees inures to
the benefit of the contractor who provides the training program and WH will not
assert that these activities are considered as work for an employer within the
coverage of the Act. Similarly, classroom activities whether or not resulting
in a useful product would be part of or incidental to the vocational training
program.</p><p>(g)           
In determining the wages paid employees described in (c) above
the joint employers may include the reasonable cost of such items as food,
lodging, clothing, laundry, transportation to and from work, and medical and
dental care in accordance with Reg 531. The reasonable cost of providing an
employee with medical and dental care may be based on the average of the costs
actually incurred for all employees over a representative period.</p><p>(h)          
In a Job Corps center (or camp) operated by a private employer,
the above principles in no way affect the application of the FLSA or SCA or PCA
to the employer’s own employees or employees of any subcontractors involved.

              <p>(a)           
In some cases school employees will work outside of their normal
working hours where a third party (either public or private) uses the school
facilities. For example, a community organization may use the school cafeteria
for a banquet or the auditorium for a concert, and the food service or
custodial employees of the school will perform the necessary services. Time
spent in the operation of a school and the maintenance of school property, both
during and after regular school hours is normally considered hours worked under
the Act. School employees engaged in the operation and maintenance of school
facilities during periods in which their services are made available to a third
party are considered to be jointly employed by the school and the third party
if the school itself contracts for the use of such employees. The total time
spent in work for the joint employers will be counted as hours worked and paid
for in compliance with the MW and OT pay provisions of the Act.</p><p>(b)           
If the school does not require that its employees be utilized by
nonschool organizations when using school facilities but such employees are
hired merely for the convenience of the outside group and are paid directly by
them, the hours worked and compensation paid to such employees for this time
need not be included in determining compensation due to the employee for their
employment by the school.</p>

Situations may be encountered where a university has established
a federally-funded “University Year for ACTION” (UYA) service learning program
pursuant to the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (DVSA). These programs
provide that students will receive college credits when they volunteer to
perform various services, often for a nonprofit private organization, on a
full-time basis for a year. The students receive a subsistence-level stipend to
cover their expenses, and they are required to live at the low income level of
the people they serve. The legislative history of the DVSA and the FLSA make
clear that these students are not considered employees for purposes of the
FLSA.</p><p>(2)          
Universities which receive federal “University Year ACTION” funds

a city-sponsored program during his or her off-duty time as a charitable or
civil act. Similarly a person may participate in the civil defense program for
civil or personal motives. Where a person performs such volunteer services
without promise or expectation of compensation, at hours that suit his or her
own convenience whether by schedule or otherwise, and where no regular employee
is replaced in the performance of normal duties, no employer-employee
relationship exists with respect to such time. The activity may be performed on
the employer’s premises so long as it is not done during any time the employee
is required to be on the premises and the control exercised by the employer is
only minimal. A person, however, may not be both an employee and a volunteer
while performing essentially the same duties. Thus, for example, a person
employed in park activities cannot have his or her time divided into “working
hours” and “volunteer hours” while performing the same or related duties.</p>

              <p>(a)           
Whether individuals who provide child care services in their own
homes under an agreement with a government social service agency are employees
of such agency would depend upon the total fact situation involved in the
arrangement. If the parent (or person standing in the place of a parent) is
free to select, and in fact does select, an individual from a list of persons
supplied by the agency as qualified to perform the child care services, with
the agency merely agreeing to reimburse the child care “operator” selected, an
employee-employer relationship would not exist between the government agency
and the operator. Further, if the agency utilizes bona fide volunteers as day
care operators over whom no control is exercised, and the monetary payment is
simply to reimburse the operator for expenses, no employment relationship would
exist. However, the activities of such day care homes may be covered under the
Act, and the operator responsible for compliance with respect to any employees
employed in connection with the operation of the child care center. (See also
FOH 12g00.)</p><p>(b)           
Conversely, if in fact such freedom of choice does not exist, and
the parent is told to which home the child must be taken for this service, and
the agency is closely involved in directing and controlling the operator in
performing the duties in rendering the child care services, an
employee-employer relationship would exist between the agency and the operator.</p>

The court has held that patient workers in hospitals or
institutions whose work is of any consequential economic benefit to the
facility are to be treated as employees. While the court has generally
considered all circumstances in determining whether an employment relationship
existed, the court specifically rejected as determinative the alleged
therapeutic value of the work or the patient’s level of performance. In
general, we would hold that there is consequential economic benefit to the
institution if the work in question would be performed by someone else if it
were not done by the patient. However, where a patient is undergoing evaluation
or training, we will not hold the patient to be an employee during the first
three months of engagement in a work activity or activities provided the
patient spends no more than one hour a day and no more than 5 hours a week in
such activities and provided further that competent instruction and supervision
is provided the patient during such period.</p><p>(b)           
A patient in a hospital or institution may volunteer and need not
be considered an employee for such services which would not be compensated by
the institution if performed by a person other than a patient. Such volunteer
services may include wheeling another patient in a wheelchair to and from
certain activities, planting a vegetable garden if the fruits of such labor
belong to the patient, and other similar activities. However, the ordinary
maintenance, patient care, office work and other activities that are performed
in the operation of an institution would create an employment relationship.</p>

              <p>(a)           
More and more States are adopting welfare/workfare programs, i.e.
programs that require persons to perform work in some capacity in exchange for
receiving welfare assistance. These programs need to be carefully examined to
determine if an employer - employee relationship subject to FLSA exists. If the
welfare recipient is an employee subject to FLSA, the following facts must be
determined:</p><p>(1)          
Does the State welfare/workfare statute grant the State authority
to require the welfare recipient to work for their assistance?</p><p>(2)          
What hours of work are required of welfare recipients and are
records kept of those work hours?</p><p>(3)          
Does the welfare assistance (cash/benefits) provide a wage of not
less than the applicable MW and proper payment of OT when worked?</p><p>(4)          
Are recipients employed in violation of the child labor
provisions?</p><p>(b)           
If FLSA violations exist, potential BW and CMP liability should
be determined, and copies of documentation supporting the facts obtained above,
forwarded to the AA/OPO for review prior to any discussion with State
authorities regarding FLSA compliance. After this review, the AA/OPO will

considered to exist between a bona fide partnership and the partners of whom it

excluded form the category of employers subject to its terms. It is clear that
the employment relationship may exist at least between such an organization and
non-members whom it hires or suffers or permits to work. Nor can it be said
that membership in a cooperative in the ordinary case establishes a mutual
agency analogous to a partnership or otherwise identifies the member so closely
with the cooperative that they cannot become, respectively, employer and
employee. Among the circumstances which may be taken to indicate that a
cooperative is an entity separate and distinct from its worker-members, are a
corporate form of organization, the presence of the usual incidents of the
employment relationship (for example, control by the governing body or a
designated officer over the work performed, the member’s hours of labor,
selection for and discharge from the job and the like) and the exercise of
financial or managerial control or the furnishing of capital or management
services by outsiders, especially if such outsiders are wholesalers, manufacturers,
or others who purchase or dispose of the products of the cooperatives.</p>

Similarly, the government of a political subdivision, e.g., county, city, etc.,

Whether a community action agency, which administers various
antipoverty and economic opportunity programs, is a covered employer under the
FLSA depends upon the facts in a particular situation. Any community action
agency which is an entity of a State, a political subdivision of a State, or a
combination of public agencies is clearly an employer covered under the Act.

However, a community action agency which consists solely of a
private nonprofit agency or organization that has been designated by the State
(or political subdivision thereof) would not thereby become a “public agency”.
This does not, of course, preclude coverage of such private community action
agency under another provision of the FLSA. A private community action agency
does not become a “public agency” merely because it receives and disburses
Federal funds. However, see FOH 59d.</p><p>(b)

              <h3>10d00 - Scope of the term “employee”.</h3>
              <p>(a)           
Sec 3(e)(1) of the amended Act defines the term “employee” to
include any individual employed by an employer, except as provided in Secs
3(e)(2), (3) and (4).</p><p>(b)           
Sec 3(e)(2) of the amended Act provides that in the case of an
individual employed by a public agency, the term “employee” means:</p><p>(1)          
any individual employed by the Government of the United States –</p><p>a.             
as a civilian in the military departments (as defined in section
102 of title 5, United States Code),</p><p>b.             
in any executive agency (as defined in section 105 of such
title),</p><p>c.             
in any unit of the legislative or judicial branch of the
Government which has positions in the competitive service,</p><p>d.             
in a nonappropriated fund instrumentality under the jurisdiction
of the Armed Forces, or</p><p>e.             
in the Library of Congress</p><p>(2)          
any individual employed by the United States Postal Service or
the Postal Rate Commission; and</p><p>(3)          
any individual employed by a State, political subdivision of a
State, or an interstate governmental agency, other than such an individual –</p><p>a.             
who is not subject to the civil service laws of the State,
political subdivision, or agency which employs him; and</p><p>b.             
who</p><p>1.             
holds a public elective office of that State, political
subdivision, or agency,</p><p>2.             
is selected by the holder of such an office to be a member of his
personal staff,</p><p>3.             
is appointed by such an office holder to serve on a policy-making
level, or</p><p>4.             
who is an immediate adviser to such an office holder with respect
to the constitutional or legal powers of his or her office, or</p><p>5.             
is an employee in the legislative branch or legislative body of
such State, political subdivision, or agency and is not employed by the
legislative library of such State, political subdivision, or agency</p><p>c.             
The first category (b. 1, above) is limited to those persons who
are elected by the voters of the pertinent jurisdiction.  With respect to the
second and third categories (b.2 and b.3, above) the following are examples of
tests which are to be considered:</p><p>1.             
Is the person’s employment entirely at the discretion of the
elected office holder?</p><p>2.             
Is the position not subject to approval or clearance by the
personnel department or division of any part of the government?</p><p>3.             
Is the work performed outside of any position or occupation
established by a table of organization as part of a legislative, executive, or
judicial branch, or a committee or commission established by such a branch?</p><p>4.             
Is the person’s compensation dependent upon a specific
appropriation or is it paid out of an office expense allowance provided to the
office holder? </p><p>The fourth
category (b.4, above) is limited to that of a legal advisor, i.e., a lawyer.</p><p>d.             
Thus individuals such as pages, stenographers, telephone
operators, clerks, typists and others employed by the branch or commission as a
whole, may be considered “employees” under the Act. An additional example would
be deputy sheriffs who, although they are selected by and work under the
direction of the sheriff, are employed only after approval of their employment
by the Board of Commissioners. They are not employed at the sole discretion of
the sheriff pursuant to the second (II, above) category.</p><p>(c)           
Of course, employees who are not excluded by the provisions of
Sec 3(e)(2)(C) may qualify for exemption under Reg 541 if the tests are met.</p><p>(d)           
Pursuant to section 3(e)(4) of the FLSA, the term “employee” does
not include any individual who volunteers to perform services for a public
agency which is a State, a political subdivision of a State, or an interstate
government agency, if-</p><p>(1)          
the individual receives no compensation or is paid expenses,
reasonable benefits, or a nominal fee to perform the services for which the
individual volunteered; and</p><p>(2)          
such services are not the same type of services which the
individual is employed to perform for such public agency.</p><p>(e)           
An employee of a public agency which is a State, political
subdivision of a State, or an interstate governmental agency may volunteer to
perform services for any other State, political subdivision, or interstate
governmental agency, including a State, political subdivision or agency with
which the employing State, political subdivision, or agency has a mutual aid
agreement.</p>

Sec 3(e)(2)(C) excludes from the definition of employee under the
FLSA individuals who are selected by an elected office holder to be a member of
his or her personal staff. The “personal staff” does not include individuals
who are directly supervised by someone other than the elected official even
though they may be selected by and serve at the pleasure of such official.</p><p>(b)           
Generally personal staff includes only persons who are under the
direct supervision of the elected official and who have almost daily contact
with him or her. It would, for example, include the official’s private
secretary, but not the secretary to his or her assistant, or the stenographers
in a pool that services the official’s department, or staff members in an
operational unit whose head reports to the elected official. It would typically
not include all members of an operational unit, since all the members could not
have a personal working relationship with the elected official.</p>

duties both in the U.S. and foreign countries such as Canada, Mexico, or

              <p>(a)           
Coverage shall be asserted for U.S. and foreign citizens employed
at or working out of an establishment or work site, located in a State, as
defined in the Act, even though the employer is a foreign citizen, when such
employees are engaged in or producing goods for interstate commerce or are
employed in an enterprise described in Sec 3(s).</p><p>(b)           
Employees employed by and working in an establishment located in
a foreign country are not considered subject to the FLSA merely because they make
deliveries in the States, or pick up materials in the States for transport to a
foreign country.</p><p>(c)           
On the other hand, where an employee of such an establishment is
working in the U.S. for a substantial period of time and performs covered,
nonexempt work, coverage would be asserted. A worker who travels more than 25
miles from the U.S. border or spends more than 72 hours in the U.S. on a single
visit (whichever occurs first) is considered to have spent a substantial period
of time in the U.S. Once a worker has spent a substantial period in the U.S.,
all hours of work in the U.S. on that visit must be compensated at no less than
the minimum wage, including hours of work prior to the worker reaching the 25
mile or 72 hour mark</p>
