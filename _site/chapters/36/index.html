              <h3>36a00 - History.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHAct) was enacted to ensure safe
and healthful working conditions for working men and women.  The OSHAct is a
law with broad applicability, and is generally interpreted and enforced either
directly by the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA), or by an OSHA approved State Plan state agency (see FOH 36a02).</p><p>29 USC 651, et seq.; 29 U.S.C 655 &amp; 657; 29 CFR 1903.03(a)</p><p>(b)   Pursuant to
section 6 of the OSHAct, OSHA issued regulations (see 29 CFR 1928.110 and
1910.142) establishing minimum standards for field sanitation (FS) and
temporary labor camps (TLC) in covered agricultural settings.  A detailed
discussion of the FS requirements appears in section 36d of this chapter, and
the TLC requirements appear in section 36e.</p><p>National Congress of Hispanic American Citizens v.
Dunlop. 425 F.Supp.900;</p><p>National Congress of Hispanic American Citizens v.
Marshall. 626 F.2d 882, 200 U.S.App.D.C. 18;</p><p>Farmworker Justice Fund, Inc. v. Brock. 811 F.2d 613,
258 U.S.App.D.C. 271</p><p>(c)   Following a
pilot project involving the exchange of certain enforcement responsibilities
between the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) and OSHA, and pursuant to Secretary’s
Order 5-96 (see 62 Fed. Reg. 107), the authority to conduct inspections, issue
citations and propose penalties and to develop and issue compliance
interpretations regarding FS and TLC requirements to enforce compliance by
agricultural employers under sections 8, 9, and 10 of the OSHAact was
transferred from OSHA to WHD.  However, OSHA retained rulemaking authority for
FS and TLC under section 6 of the OSHAct.  The effective date of this transfer
was February 3, 1997.</p><p>Secretary’s Order 5-96; 29 U.S.C 655, 657, 658, &amp;

              <h3>36a01 - Purpose.</h3>
              <p>The Occupational Safety and Health Act was enacted
“to ensure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe
and healthful working conditions…”  Absent or inadequate sanitation and hygiene
has long been recognized by medical science as a principal factor in the
transmission of bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases.  Inadequate water
supply and human waste removal have been shown to produce critical health
problems.  Provision of potable drinking water, the proper disposal of human
wastes, and the use of personal and public hygienic practices are known to
prevent heat related illnesses and the transmission of many communicable
diseases.  Thus, the provision of sanitation facilities is necessary to ensure
safe and healthy working conditions.</p><p>52 Fed. Reg. 16050  </p>

              <h3>36b00 - Foreword.</h3>
              <p>Generally, agricultural employees of an agricultural
employer are covered by the OSHAct, and OSHA has promulgated several standards
for the protection of the safety and health of agricultural workers (29 CFR
1928).  These standards include rules for sanitation facilities in the field
(29 CFR 1928.110).  A separate OSHA standard requires sanitation facilities in
temporary labor camps (29 CFR 1910.142).</p><p>When conducting an OSHA Field Sanitation
inspection/investigation statutory coverage must first be established followed
by regulatory coverage under 29 CFR 1910.142 and 1928.110.</p><p>52 Fed. Reg. 16050-01, 1987 WL 142266 (F.R.)</p>

              <h3>36b01 - Agricultural Employer.</h3>
              <p>An agricultural employer is defined as “any person,
corporation, association, or other legal entity that:</p><p>(i)    Owns or
operates an agricultural establishment;</p><p>(ii)  Contracts with the
owner or operator of an agricultural establishment in advance of production for
the purchase of a crop and exercises substantial control over production; or</p><p>(iii) Recruits and supervises
employees or is responsible for the management and condition of an agricultural
establishment.”</p><p>An agricultural establishment is defined as “a
business operation that uses paid employees in the production of food, fiber,
or other materials such as seed, seedlings, plants or parts of plants.”</p><p>Specified as employers are those who both recruit and
supervise employees, (e.g. many crew leaders and harvest companies), as well as
those who are responsible for the management and condition of an agricultural
establishment.  Additionally, an advance purchaser of a crop or a substantial
part of a crop who exercises substantial control over production is specified
to be an employer.  OSHA sought to hold jointly and severally responsible for
compliance those who are best able to assure that adequate sanitation
facilities and potable water are provided to farm workers in the fields.</p><p>52 Fed. Reg. 16050-01, 1987 WL 142266 (F.R.)</p>

              <h3>36b02 - Statutory Coverage.</h3>
              <p>Statutory coverage under the OSHAct exists where
there is a person who meets the definition of an employer who employs at least
one employee.  Under Sec. 3 of the OSHAct, person is defined as “…one or more
individuals, partnerships, associations, corporations, business trusts, legal
representatives, or any organized group of persons.”  An employer “means a
person engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees,” and an
employee “means an employee of an employer who is employed in a business of his
employer which affects commerce.”</p><p>Commerce means trade, traffic, commerce,
transportation, or communication among the several States, or between a State
and any place outside thereof, or within the District of Columbia, or a
possession of the United Sates, or between points in the same State but through
a point outside thereof.  As used in the OSHAct, the terms affects commerce and
affecting commerce are, for all intents and purposes, synonymous. (Note: 
Affects commerce appears in the statutory definition of employee, and affecting
commerce is in the definition of employer.)  Although not defined in the
statute, both affects commerce and affecting commerce describe the breadth of
activities relative to commerce which govern whether the Act applies.</p><p>Conceptually, the terms affects and affecting
commerce include, but are more expansive than, the FLSA term engaged in
commerce or the production of goods for commerce.  OSHA, the Occupational
Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC - see FOH 36f), and the courts have
consistently construed affects and affecting commerce so as to have the
broadest possible application.</p><p>In summary, in order to determine whether the OSHAct
applies to a given agricultural employer, the employer needs to be engaging in
commerce or affecting commerce.  This is somewhat broader than the FLSA
language “engaged in commerce.”  An employer not “engaging in commerce” could
be considered to affect commerce.  Secondly, the agricultural establishment
must be an employer, and lastly, the employer must have employees who affect
commerce.  Note that the concept of employee is controlled by what the employer
does, not by what the employee does.</p><p>Nothing in the OSHAct’s coverage is conceptually
parallel to individual coverage under the FLSA.  Also, no dollar volume test
exists under OSHAct.  It applies to employers regardless of their annual dollar
volume of business.  It also apples to employers who would be otherwise exempt
from the provisions of MSPA, (i.e. the family farm exemption).  No comparable
exemptions exist under the OSHAct.</p><p>Statutory coverage cannot be presumed, it must be
affirmatively established and documented for every case.  Once statutory
coverage is established, it must be determined whether the employer is subject
to either (or both) the FS and TLC regulations.</p><p>29 USC 651, et. seq.</p>

              <h3>36b03 - Regulatory Coverage.</h3>
              <p>(a)   After
establishing statutory coverage, coverage under 29 CFR 1928.110 needs to be
established.  Agricultural employers that have employed 11 or more workers “on
any given day in hand-labor operations in the field” during the preceding 12
months must provide field sanitation facilities.</p><p>29 CFR 1928.110(a).  </p><p>(b)   The time span
used to determine the number of employees controlled by the employer shall be
the single highest number employed at any one time over the past 12 months. 
Only those employees who fall within the definition of “hand-labor operations”
are to be counted.  Particular attention should be given to the excluded field
or field-related activities when counting covered employees, as defined at 29 CFR
1928.110(a)(iii).  At least 11 or more employees have to be working in the
field on any single day within the past 12 months.  Family members of the
employer are not counted for the purpose of determining whether there are
eleven hand laborers in the field.  Finally, the 11 or more workers may have
worked in separate fields, and the number of employees is day specific (i.e., not
a collective or cumulative count).  The number of employees employed on the
date that the investigation does not determine coverage unless that number
equals 11 or more workers.</p><p>See 52 Fed. Reg. 16084; 02/06/1989 OSHA Memorandum </p><p>(c)   Hand-labor
Operations:  Only employees engaged in hand-labor agricultural activities or
agricultural operations, and only those employees engaged in hand-labor
operations are to be counted towards the eleven or more workers.  Hand-labor
operations refer to agricultural activities or agricultural operations
performed by hand or with hand tools.  Except for purposes of 29 CFR
1928.110(c)(2)(iii), the term also includes other activities or operations
performed in conjunction with hand labor in the field.  Activities such as
hand-cultivation, hand-weeding, hand-planting and hand-harvesting of
vegetables, nuts, fruits, seedlings or other crops, and the hand-packing of
produce into containers, whether done on the ground, on a moving machine or in
a temporary packing shed located in the field, are all examples of hand-labor
operations.  Hand-labor is defined as activities “on the ground, on a moving
machine or in a temporary packing shed located in the field.” </p><p>Machine Operators:  Those operating machines in
conjunction with hand-laborers, such as tractor drivers pulling the platform
from which the hand-labor occurs, are also covered. For example, if an employer
has a tractor effectively working as part of a crew in a field, the tractor
operator is to be treated as a hand laborer for the purpose of calculating the
number of hand laborers working in the field.</p><p>29 CFR 1928.110(b); 52 Fed. Reg. 16086-16087.</p><p>(d)   Mushroom farms: 
hand-labor operations in growing mushrooms, whether inside permanent structures
or not, are expressly covered under the field sanitation standard.</p><p>            52 Fed. Reg. 16087</p><p>(e)   Workers in
permanent greenhouse structures, packing or canning workers in permanent
structures, workers engaged in logging or livestock operations, or those
working on agricultural machinery not in conjunction with hand-laborers are not
covered by the field sanitation standard.  </p><p>            29 CFR 1928.110(b); 52 Fed. Reg. 16087.</p>

intended the Act to reach as far as its commerce power constitutionally permits

agricultural employer, the Agency sought to hold jointly and severally
responsible for compliance those who are best able to assure that adequate
sanitation facilities and potable water are provided to farmworkers in the
fields. (52 Fed. Reg. 16050, 16086; May 1, 1987).</p><p>OSHA Memorandum June 6, 1994; OSHA Opinion Letter

              <p>Pine straw is the fresh, undecomposed pine needles
that have fallen from pine trees.  It is produced commercially and collected
for use as a mulch and groundcover.  The raking, gathering, baling and loading
of pine straw for commercial purposes is usually performed in pine stands or
plantations, from pine trees being grown for forestry and lumbering operations.</p><p>Pine stand owners qualify as agricultural employers
because they own or operate pine stands or pine plantations, which qualify as
agricultural establishments.  Pine straw workers generally qualify for the
protections of the OSHAct field sanitation standards when the agricultural
establishment employs 11 or more workers on any one day during the previous 12
months to perform “hand labor” field work.  Workers performing such work in
different fields at the same establishment should be included in the employee
count for determining coverage.</p><p>The Department has determined that the OSHAct field
sanitation standards apply to employer operations who employ employees in
hand-labor operations necessary to the gathering pine straw for sale as a

“easily reached without crossing an unbridged stream, a super highway, or any
natural or man-made barrier to reach the toilet and handwashing facility.</p><p>Some fields for example may be located on steep
mountain sides, river deltas or wetlands and the like, into or on which

requirement cannot be met due to terrain, the facilities should be placed as

              <p>The field sanitation facilities must be provided at
no cost to the employee (see 29 CFR 1928.110(c)).</p><p>Employers who charge for field sanitation facilities
are subject to citation and penalties under the OSHAct.  Where the evidence
supports a finding that an employer charged the cost for providing required
facilities to the employees, the WHI should inform the employer that such
charges are unlawful and seek restitution for the affected workers.</p><p>In addition, charging for field sanitation facilities
violates the FLSA obligation to pay the minimum wage if it takes the employee’s
wages below FLSA MW in a non-overtime workweek; such deductions cannot be made
in overtime workweeks to an employee who is entitled to FLSA OT compensation
(e.g. potentially reforestation workers) (see FOH32j08).  The same principle
applies to H-2A covered workers: such deductions cannot take H-2A covered
workers below the H-2A required wage; in addition to a potential wage
violation, it may also be failure to comply with other laws.  If the cost is
passed on to the workers via deduction from pay, it may be a violation of MSPA’s
obligation to pay wages owed when due since illegal deductions cannot be taken. 
A MSPA violation for failing to disclose all terms and conditions of employment
may also exist if the workers were not properly notified of the cost to the
workers (albeit illegal) for the facilities.  Whether such a charge constitutes
an impermissible deduction under other laws and regulations enforced by the WHD
shall be determined based upon the requirements of the law and regulation.</p><p>29 CFR 1928.110(c) </p>

              <h3>36e00 - Introduction.</h3>
              <p>Migrant agricultural worker temporary housing inspections
normally will be conducted under MSPA, (see FOH Chapter 36) or the H-2A program
requirements pertaining to housing (see FOH Chapter 38). It is recommended that
the WHI first determine whether or not temporary labor camp housing standards
can be enforced under MSPA or H-2A.  Generally, enforcement of the temporary
labor camp standards (i.e., 29 CFR 1910.142) should be carried out under the
MSPA statutory authority or H-2A program of the INA if the employer is subject
to those requirements.  However, if the employer housing is located within a
State for which WHD has jurisdiction under the OSHAct and it is uncertain
whether or not MSPA coverage applies or if the provider of the housing can
claim a MSPA exemption - or if the violations involve risks to health and
safety that warrant the application of the remedies available under OSHAct, the
investigation shall be conducted under WHD’s OSHAct authority.  It is not
appropriate to cite and sanction violations under different Acts for the same
violation(s).</p><p>Note that S/O 5-96 specifies that WHD temporary labor
camp enforcement under the OSHAct is  limited to those agricultural
establishments where employees are engaged in “agricultural employment” as
defined by MSPA at 29 USC 1802(3) (See also 29 CFR 500.20(e)), regardless of
the number of employees, including employees engaged in hand packing of produce
into containers, whether done on the ground, on a moving machine, or in a
temporary packing shed, except OSHA retains jurisdiction over agricultural temporary
labor camps for employees engaged in egg, poultry, or red meat production, or
post-harvest processing of agricultural or horticultural commodities.  Again,
WHD authority under the OSHAct is not limited to whether the workers are
migrant or seasonal agricultural workers as those terms are defined under the
MSPA – but whether the work being performed by the workers constitutes
“agricultural employment” as that term is defined under MSPA.</p><p>29 CFR 500.132; 29 USC 1802; 26 USC 3121(g)</p>

              <p>Employers providing temporary housing to workers must
meet applicable OSHA standards for health and safety.  The substantive housing
requirements are found at 29 CFR 1910.142.  These standards are enforced under

April 3, 1980 or contracted to be built after March 4, 1980.  No change occurred

requires employees to live in the housing; or</p><p>(b)   The isolated
location of the work or the lack of economically comparable alternative housing
makes it a practical necessity to use employer provided housing; or</p><p>(c)   The housing is
provided or made available as a benefit to the employer.</p><p>(d)   OSHAct

the camp is directly related to the employment of those persons using the
housing:</p><p>(1)  The housing is
provided free or at low cost; or</p><p>(2)  The housing is owned,
controlled or provided by the employer; or</p><p>(3)  No other alternative
housing is reasonably accessible to the employees considering the distance from
the alternative housing to the worksite, the absence of transportation from the
alternative housing to the worksite, or the cost of the alternative housing; or</p><p>(4)  The housing is made
available to ensure that the business is provided with an adequate supply of
labor; or</p><p>(5)  The employees living
in the housing are required to work for the employer upon demand.</p><p>OSHA Revised Field

              <p>Familiarity with the following terms is essential to the
proper interpretation and application of the FS and TLC standards under the
OSHAct:</p><p>(a)   Commerce means
trade, traffic, commerce, transportation, or communication among the several
States, or District of Columbia, or a possession of the United States other
than the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or between points in the same
State but through a point outside thereof.</p><p>29 USC 652 (3)</p><p>(b)   As used in the
OSHAct, the terms affects commerce and affecting commerce are, for all intents
and purposes, synonymous. (Note:  Affects commerce appears in the statutory
definition of employee, and affecting commerce is in the definition of
employer.)  Although not defined in the statute, both affects commerce and affecting
commerce describe the breadth of activities relative to commerce which govern
whether the Act applies.</p><p>Conceptually, the terms affects and affecting
commerce include, but are more expansive than, the FLSA term engaged in
commerce or the production of goods for commerce.  OSHA, the Occupational
Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC) and the courts have consistently
construed affects and affecting commerce so as to have the broadest possible
application.</p><p>29 USC 652; 29 USC 651(b); Usery V. Lacy, 628 F.2d
1226 (9th Cir. 1980); 29 CFR 1975.3(a).</p><p>(c)   A citation is
the document used to notify an employer that WHD has determined that a
violation of the field sanitation and/or temporary labor camp standard has
occurred.</p><p>The citation must specify the violation(s), the
abatement period(s) within which the violation(s) must be remedied, and the
proposed civil money penalties (if any).</p><p>29 USC 658</p><p>(d)   Person means
one or more individuals, partnerships, associations, corporations, business
trusts, legal representatives, or any organized group of persons.</p><p>29 USC 652</p><p>(e)   Employer means
a person engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees, but does
not include the United States or any State or political subdivision of a State.</p><p>29 USC 652</p><p>(f)   Employee means
an employee of an employer who is employed in a business of his employer which
affects commerce.</p><p>29 USC 652</p><p>(g)   Imminent danger
refers to &quot;any conditions or practices in any place of employment which
are such that a danger exists which could reasonably be expected to cause death
or serious physical harm immediately or before the imminence of such danger can
be eliminated through the enforcement procedures otherwise provided.&quot;</p><p>29 USC 662</p><p>(h)  Serious violation
refers, for the purpose of determining the nature and gravity of a violation
when considering the appropriateness of a CMP under § 17 of the OSHAct, to a
situation at a place of employment in which &quot;there is a substantial
probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a condition
which exists, or from one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or
processes which have been adopted or are in use, in such place of employment unless
the employer did not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence,
know of the presence of the violation.&quot;</p><p>29 USC 666</p><p>(i)    State
Plan state refers to a state which has applied for and been granted the
authority to develop and enforce occupational safety and health standards
(which must provide a level of protection for workers that is at least as effective
as the Federal standards).  See FOH 36a02(b) for a listing of those State Plan
states that have elected to retain OSHAct FS and TLC enforcement.</p><p>29 USC 667</p><p>(j)    Occupational
Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC), refers to the commission mandated
by the OSHAct which is responsible for carrying out adjudicatory functions
under the OSHAct.  OSHRC appointed hearing examiners (performing in a capacity
analogous to that of an administrative law judge) hear contested matters, and
issue final orders on behalf of the OSHRC.</p><p>29 USC 661</p><p>(k)  Agricultural employer
- refers to any person, corporation, association, or other legal entity that: 
1) owns or operates an agricultural establishment; 2) contracts with the owner
or operator of any agricultural establishment in advance of production for the
purchase of a crop and exercises substantial control over production; or 3)
recruits and supervises employees or is responsible for the management and
condition of an agricultural establishment.  NOTE:  The term agricultural
employer is not synonymous with the term as defined in MSPA – see section 3(2)
of MSPA, and 29 CFR 500.20(d)).</p><p>29 CFR 1928.110(b)</p><p>(l)    Agricultural
establishment refers to a business operation that uses paid employees in the production
of food, fiber, or other materials such as seed, seedlings, plants, or parts of
plants.</p><p>29 CFR 1928.110(b)</p><p>(m) Hand-labor operations
refers to agricultural activities or agricultural operations performed by hand
or with hand tools.  Except for purposes of 29 CFR 1928.110(c)(2)(iii), the
term also includes other activities or operations performed in conjunction with
hand labor in the field.  Activities such as hand-cultivation, hand-weeding,
hand-planting and hand-harvesting of vegetables, nuts, fruits, seedlings or
other crops, including mushrooms, and the hand-packing of produce into
containers, whether done on the ground, on a moving machine or in a temporary
packing shed located in the field, are all examples of hand-labor operations. 
The term does not however include such activities as logging operations, the
care or feeding of livestock, or hand-labor operations in permanent structures
such as canning facilities or packing houses.</p><p>29 CFR 1928.110(b)</p><p>(n)  Abatement
Verification refers to regulatory standards enforced by OSHA which require a
cited employer to provide certification (and in certain instances
documentation) demonstrating that each cited violation has been abated.  (See
29 CFR 1903.19)  WHD’s role in the abatement verification process consists of:
(1) informing employers of the requirements; and (2) referring allegations of
non-compliance with the abatement verification requirements to OSHA for further
action.  WHD does not enforce the abatement verification requirements.</p><p>29 CFR 1903.19</p>
