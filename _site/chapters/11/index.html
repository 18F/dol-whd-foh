Bulletins and use of chapter.</h3>

issued to the general public, contain the official WH position regarding
coverage under FLSA which is based on the individual employee’s engagement in
or production for interstate or foreign commerce or in a closely related
process or occupation directly related to such production. FOH Chapter 11
supplements these documents with respect to such individual coverage.</p><p>(b)   The examples of specific occupations contained in this
chapter are designed to illustrate only the application of individual coverage
principles. The possibility of coverage based on the particular employee’s
employment in an enterprise described in Sec 3(s) must not be overlooked where
individual coverage does not exist.</p>

              <h3>11a01 - Summary statement of
individual coverage.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Individual coverage depends on the nature of the
particular employee’s work. An employee is covered on an individual basis in
each workweek in which he or she performs any work constituting engagement in
interstate or foreign commerce, or the production of goods for interstate or
foreign commerce, including any closely related process or occupation directly
essential to such production. As a practical matter, WH does not assert
individual coverage over an employee who is ordinarily engaged in employment
which is not so covered but who may on isolated occasions spend an
insubstantial amount of time performing individually covered work. However,
this rule is not applicable in any workweek in which an employee spends a
substantial amount of time doing individually covered work. If, in viewing the
employment over a more extended period, it is apparent that the pattern of
individual coverage is regular and recurrent, the employee involved is so
covered in each workweek in which he does such work, regardless of whether the
amount of time spent in this work is substantial or insubstantial. In
situations where an employer, for compliance purposes, seeks to segregate
individual coverage from other employment, the employer must be prepared to
demonstrate the basis of this segregation from his or her records.</p><p>(b)   It is not possible to establish precise guidelines to
be followed in determining whether an employee who is not otherwise covered on an
individual basis spends an insubstantial amount of time on isolated occasions
in the performance of individually covered work. In view of the remedial
purposes of the Act, the application of this rule is limited to circumstances
where the time consumed by an employee in doing such covered work is obviously
trivial, and the incidence of this covered work is so infrequent and
out-of-pattern that it would be unrealistic to assert individual coverage
solely on such grounds. This must be decided on the facts in a particular case.</p>

State lines are regular and recurring and are made in the performance of their
duties. In addition, display materials received from out of State sources and
earmarked for particular sites remain in interstate commerce until final
installation is effected; and, the employees installing such material (for
example, window trimmers and billboard pasters) are individually covered. This

distribution of out-of-State advertising, manufacturers’ samples, and telephone
directories by hand to local individuals and businesses may be subject to the
FLSA as engaged in interstate commerce. Where the items distributed are
received from out-of-State sources, they remain in the stream of interstate
commerce until they reach the destination intended for them by the importer.
Thus, they remain in interstate commerce while they are being distributed from
door to door. With respect to telephone books, for example, there is a
pre-existing contract or understanding with the subscribers for their delivery.
The door-to-door delivery is not any more of an interruption in the interstate
journey than the drop-shipment delivery to a customer of out-of-State goods by
any local transportation company. The distributing companies are merely agents
for their principals, their only function being to make deliveries of the
advertising matter, manufacturers’ samples, or telephone directories in
accordance with previous understandings or instructions.</p><p>(b)   Employees engaged in the collection and shipment of

              <h3>11a11 - Ambulance
services.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Ambulance drivers and attendants who transport persons
on part of an interstate trip (as to or from an airport or railway terminal) or
who travel across State lines in performing ambulance services are engaged in
covered activities.</p><p>(b)   Ambulance crews engaged in making intrastate trips to
pick up dead or injured victims of motor vehicle accidents from the scenes of
such accidents on city streets, county roads or State or federal highways are
also engaged in individually covered activities. It is well established that
vehicle accidents which interfere with the interstate movement of goods and
persons on the highways require prompt action to remove the stopped and
disabled vehicles which constitute a costly and dangerous impediment to the
free movement of such commerce. The vehicles blocking the traffic cannot in
most instances be permitted to be moved from their post-accident positions on
the roadway until such persons as may have been injured or killed in the
accident have been attended to. Ordinarily, this requires ambulance service
whenever a highway accident involves deaths or personal injuries of a serious
nature. To appreciate the serious effect on traffic of any delay in the arrival
of ambulances and removal of damaged vehicles by towtrucks in such cases, it is
only necessary to listen to the aerial police reports on traffic during the
rush hours in any sizable city. Detours, delay, and congestion of traffic on
any interstate route in which one or more lanes become blocked by such
accidents are the rule until the vehicles are removed, which police ordinarily
do not permit pending necessary attention to any victims of the accident. Such

              <h3>11b04 - Building
maintenance and custodial employees.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Individual coverage of building maintenance and
custodial employees (boiler firemen, building engineers, electricians,
painters, janitors, elevator operators and the like), is to be determined in
accordance with the principles stated in (b) through (d) below.</p><p>(b)   A maintenance or custodial employee serving the
building or any part of it is individually covered if he or she is regularly
and recurringly engaged in such activities as ordering or receiving goods from
outside the State, handling or otherwise “producing” goods for shipment to
other States, keeping records relative to interstate transactions, or using the
telephone or the mails for interstate communication. Individual coverage on
this basis may arise from a variety of activities. For example, a building
switchboard operator would be individually covered if he or she regularly and
recurringly handles interstate telephone calls for tenants. Likewise, a porter
or elevator operator who regularly and recurringly handles interstate freight
and packages for tenants would be individually covered. Moreover, an elevator
operator is individually covered if letter carriers and parcel post conveyers
regularly and recurringly ride the elevator he or she operates to make
deliveries of letters and parcels which have moved in interstate commerce.</p><p>(c)   A building maintenance or custodial employee will be
considered to be individually covered if as a regular and recurring part of
their duties they serve those portions of the building occupied by a tenant
engaged in that location in interstate commerce or the production of goods for
interstate commerce. Such an employee will be individually covered, as if he or
she were employed by the tenant himself to perform the covered work. For
example, a janitor would be covered if as a part of their duties they regularly
and recurringly clean those portions of the building occupied by an interstate
insurance firm or a bank (thereby being engaged in the insurance firm’s or
bank’s production of goods for interstate commerce). Likewise, a janitor would
be covered if as a part of their duties they regularly and recurringly clean
those portions of a building occupied by a radio or TV station engaged in
interstate communications. In applying these principles to any employee the
element of substantiality must be taken into consideration. For example, a
janitor would not be considered covered  solely on the basis of taking a few
minutes each day to empty waste baskets in an “interstate” insurance office, or
because, on occasion, called upon outside their regular duties to perform some
incidental cleaning task in a bank. Nor would the performance of maintenance or
custodial services in those portions of the building occupied by an
“essentially local” business provide a basis of coverage, if the same work
would not provide a basis of coverage for a worker employed by such a tenant.
Cases where coverage is questionable will be submitted through channels to the
RS for opinion, including all cases where compliance depends on the application
of these principles to custodial employees who clean only the halls and
corridors outside the portions of the building occupied by “interstate”
tenants, or building engineers whose duties relate to the building in general
(heating air-conditioning, etc.).</p><p>(d)   Without regard to any other basis of coverage,
maintenance and custodial employees are covered on an individual basis if the
building for which they perform these functions is devoted to interstate
commerce or to the production of goods for interstate commerce to such a
substantial extent that there may be said to be a “close and immediate tie”
between the activities of such employees and the interstate commerce or
production involved. On this basis the Act has been held to cover all building
maintenance and custodial employees in loft buildings where goods are
physically produced for interstate commerce, in headquarters buildings of
companies engaged elsewhere in producing goods for interstate commerce, in
buildings substantially devoted to interstate operations of insurance companies
or government agencies, and in multi-tenant office or other buildings in which
occupants engaged in actual production of goods for commerce on the premises
utilize a substantial portion of the rentable areas for their operations.
Building maintenance and custodial employees are not individually covered by
the Act solely by reason of the fact that they service buildings operated as a
local activity not dedicated in any way to interstate commerce or to the
production of goods for such commerce, which are held out for tenancy by and
are in fact tenanted by the “usual miscellany” of offices, in which no
manufacturing is carried on. In determining whether or not the building as a
whole is so maintained and operated as to have a “close and immediate tie” to
interstate commerce or the production of goods for interstate commerce, it is
not possible to establish precise mathematical formulas based either on the
percentage of rentable space occupied by specific types of tenants or the
extent of commerce or production conducted on the premises. It is necessary to
look at the building as a whole and at the business operations conducted on the
premises by its tenants. Where compliance depends upon such a determination,
the following procedure shall be followed:</p><p>(1)  If at least half of the rentable area of the building
is occupied by tenants substantially engaged on the premises in interstate
commerce or the production of goods for interstate commerce, the building as a
whole shall be considered as maintained and operated as an instrumentality of
interstate commerce or an interstate production facility (i.e., there is the
“close and immediate tie”) and all maintenance and custodial employees shall be
considered to be individually covered. (This would clearly apply, for example,
where at lease half of the rentable area is occupied by such tenants as an
interstate insurance company or a bank, or some combination of such tenants.)</p><p>(2)  If less than half of the rentable area is occupied by
such tenants, the facts shall be obtained and the matter shall be referred
through channels to the RS for opinion. In developing the necessary
information, the approximate rentable area of the building, the types of
tenants, and the business operations conducted by the tenants with particular
reference to whether or not the Inv considers them to fall into the
“interstate” or the “usual miscellany” category shall be included. This
information can be shown by chart or in any appropriate manner with such
explanations as are required. For example, the percentage of rentable area
occupied by “interstate” tenants such as banks, insurance firms, Federal
agencies, manufacturers, and radio and TV stations can be shown in one column;
the percentage of rentable area occupied by the “usual miscellany” of local
tenants such as lawyers, doctors, and real estate agents in another column</p><p>(e)   The principles stated above do not apply to building
maintenance and custodial employees employed by a shopping center which is
composed of individual buildings contiguously located for convenience, having
only party walls as a common ground between tenants. However, such employees
may otherwise be individually covered.</p><p>(f)   In some cases, employees may be engaged to perform
only activities such as cleaning, waxing, and buffing floors, as opposed to
general janitorial services work. For purposes of individual coverage, such
employees are held in the same light as employees performing general janitorial
service work notwithstanding that their work contributes to the operations of
the customers’ buildings only from an aesthetic point of view and that the
finish on the floor has little preservative effect and does not add
significantly to the wearability of the floor. Thus, such employees are
considered to be individually covered in any w/w in which they perform such
duties in truck terminals, banks, factories producing goods for commerce, etc.
The activities of these employees are distinguished from the activities of
window washers, landscapers or exterminators. (See IB 776.19(b)(5).)</p>

production facilities.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Under IB 776.26 and 776.27, the construction of a new
factory building or other production facility designed as a replacement,
enlargement, extension or improvement of an existing covered production
facility will be individually covered. IB 776.26 points out that “Coverage of
any construction work, whether new or repair work, depends upon how closely
integrated it is with, and how essential it is to the functioning of, existing
covered facilities. Neither the mere fact that the construction is ‘new
construction’ nor the fact that it is physically separated from an existing
covered plant, is determinative.” Thus the fact that the new plant is located
at a considerable distance from the existing facility will not preclude
individual coverage. If such coverage is present, certain preparatory
operations would likewise be covered under the principles set fourth in IB
776.28(a)(3).</p><p>(b)   The following examples, while not intended to be
restrictive in any way, are illustrative of some types of construction over
which individual coverage has been asserted under the position set forth in (a)
above:</p><p>(1)  The construction of a new building in an adjacent town
to expand the operations of an existing plant which will continue to produce
goods for commerce.</p><p>(2)  The construction of a suburban drive-in branch for an
existing downtown bank. Also, the construction of a building for an existing
bank to serve as a replacement of the bank notwithstanding that the predominant
use of the new structure may be devoted to uses other than banking.</p><p>(3)  The construction of a new factory at a new location to
replace the existing plant of a firm manufacturing goods for commerce although
the new factory is at a substantial distance from the manufacturer’s present
plant.</p><p>(4)  The construction of a new factory outside of the city
limits designed specifically for the purpose of housing a garment factory now
operating in the same town, in rented quarters. The building is being financed
by local subscription under a State program of inducing new industries to move
into or remain in the state. The building when constructed will be leased to
the manufacturer.</p><p>(c)   If the Inv can make a clear determination that the
construction is individually covered because it falls within any of the four
examples described in (b) above, the investigation may proceed. If not, the
following facts should be developed and the case referred to the RS:</p><p>(1)  Is the new plant to be coordinated in any way with
production at the existing plant, and if so, how (i.e., will it be used to
produce the complete ultimate product, or will it be used for partial
processing or assembling of products begun, finished, or otherwise processed at
an existing plant)? </p><p>(2)  Does the new plant include features (in design,
materials or equipment, or otherwise) specifically adapted to the particular
kind of production?</p><p>(3)  Will there be any transfer of employees or equipment
from the existing plant to the new plant, or will there be any interchange of
employees between the existing and the new plant?</p><p>(4)  Will there be joint management and operation of the
new and the existing plant, giving any available information on plans for a
joint or segregated management and operation?</p><p>(5)  Will production start at the new plant before
completion of the construction, and if so, when and to what extent; or how soon
after completion is production at the new plant to start?</p><p>(6)  Is the new plant being constructed to produce products
for an entirely new set of customers, or is it to meet the needs of the present
source of customers because their current or imminent needs have expanded
beyond the capacity of the existing plant?</p><p>(7)  Are there outstanding any specific orders or contracts
which the new plant will be used to fill?</p>

not, which is part of an interstate highway or which directly connects with any
interstate highway is so closely related to the interstate commerce moving on
the existing highway as to be a part of it”. Therefore, employees performing

term “directly connected” would apply in all situations where the streets, city
or otherwise, are constructed as a part of a network of interstate use or

streets, which are not a part of a public road building program and are
constructed on private property as a part of a new residential development,
will not be considered covered until further clarification from the courts”.
This statement refers exclusively to the construction of such streets. However,
the repair of them is individually covered work if the streets are being regularly
used and are open to interstate commerce even though there has not yet been
State acceptance or dedication. </p>

that the employment of persons in domestic service in households affects
commerce.”</p><p>(b)   Although “domestic service” is not defined therein,

</div><p>Covered
domestic service must be performed in a private home which is a fixed place of
abode of an individual or family. A separate and distinct dwelling in an
apartment house or hotel may constitute a home. However, a boarding or lodging
house for the purpose of supplying such services to the public, as a business
enterprise, is not a private home and its employees are therefore not domestic
service employees for the purposes of the Act. Domestic service employees who
accompany their employers on trips, such as a vacation, continue to be covered.</p><p>(c)   Maids and cleaning personnel employed by businesses
furnishing home cleaning services to residential customers are not considered
domestic service employees for purposes of Secs 6(f) and 7(l) of the FLSA.
Typically, home cleaning service employers hire, train, and schedule employees,
and direct and inspect their work. The customer pays the home cleaning service
employer for the services performed. The residential customer does not directly
exercise control over the work performed by employees of the cleaning service.
As indicated in (b) above and Secs 552.3 and 552.101 of Reg 552, a domestic
service employee is one who performs household work in or about his/her
employer’s private home. Thus, an employee of a home cleaning service employer
is not a domestic service employee, and coverage for such employees would be
determined on an individual or enterprise basis.</p>

interstate communication are engaged in commerce.</p><p>(b)   If an employment agency merely screens and refers
applicants to the usual miscellany of local customers, some of whom are engaged
in the production of goods for commerce, the employees who handle the
producers’ accounts are not engaged in an occupation closely related and
directly essential to the production of goods for commerce and thus are not
individually covered by the FLSA.</p><p>(c)   However, if any employment agency engages in
recruitment or renders specialized services for producers of goods for
commerce, and thus acts as a substitute for the employment or personnel office
of the producer, employees whose work is clearly connected with a particular
employer or industry or whose activities are specifically directed to meet the
special personnel needs of producers are individually covered as engaged in an
occupation closely related and directly essential to the production of goods
for commerce. In determining whether the activities of an employment agency are
closer to the substitute function than to the typical agency (b) above, the
following factors should be considered:</p><p>(1)  Who pays the agency fees?</p><p>(2)  Is there a continuing contractual relationship between
the employer and the agency?</p><p>(3)  Is it a large scale recruitment program for particular
producers?</p><p>(4)  Does the agency actually take part in the selection of
employees or does it merely refer an applicant to possible employers?</p><p>(5)  Does the agency check references?</p><p>(6)  Does the producer of goods also advertise and solicit
help directly or does he depend primarily on the agency for his employment
supply?</p><p>(7)  Are the efforts of the agency directed primarily to
servicing the job applicant or the employer?</p><p>Where
a determination cannot be made based upon the factors noted above, the matter
should be referred through channels to the RS for an opinion.</p>

housed or fed, or both, while working on growers’ farms in the area. If the
growers’ farm commodities are produced for interstate commerce, the employees
engaged in the maintenance and operation of the migrant camps may be performing
work which is closely related and directly essential to such production. The
facts are very important to such a determination, however. Such employees in camps
maintained to satisfy a legal obligation under the Bracero program (Mexican
contract labor) are considered individually covered. On the other hand, where a
camp is operated merely as a convenience available to migrant workers and not
as an integral and indispensable part of the agricultural operations, we would
not assert individual coverage with respect to camp employees based solely on
their relationships to the agricultural production. Where questionable coverage

              <p>(a)   Employees who engage in the installation of apparatus,
equipment, machinery, and similar goods which are still moving in interstate
commerce are individually covered. Whether such goods remain in commerce during
the installation process is determined by both the nature of the contract of

a contract for work to be performed and the sale of the goods is incidental
thereto, the installation is considered to be predominantly of a local nature
and individual coverage will not apply. On the other hand, if the contract is
primarily a sale of the goods, individual coverage will apply where it is
determined that the installation activities are a necessary incident to the
sale. In making the latter determination, consideration shall be given to:</p><p>(1)  whether the performance of the installation work is
essential to the complete delivery in interstate commerce because of complexity
inherent in the product; or</p><p>(2)  whether the installation work is inherently intrastate
in character and reasonably separable from the interstate features of the sale.</p><p>If

handle, slaughter, and dress the livestock, remove the inedible portions,
handle and work on the by-products, fire the boilers, maintain, watch, or guard
the premises, as well as for those who do the office work, are also
individually covered. There is no distinction as to volume or amount of
production for interstate commerce where the shipments are regular and
recurrent.</p><p>(b)   Employees engaged in the production of by-products for
a meat packer producing or processing meats which are sold for consumption
within the same State are engaged in the production of goods for interstate
commerce if, at the time when they are engaged in the production of the
by-products the employer intends, hopes, expects, or has reason to believe that
the by-products will be sent out of the State in the same or altered form.</p><p>(c)   Tankage which is waste material or garbage is given to
a rendering company free of charge in winter and during the summer the employer
pays a fee to a rendering company for its removal. The tankage ultimately finds
its way out of State. Since this is only waste material or garbage, there is no
production of goods for interstate commerce. This should be distinguished from
a situation where a by-product is produced and shipped out of the State.</p>

investigations. If the business of the company requires the regular use of
interstate channels of communication with borrowers residing in other States,
the receipt of payments from such accounts, and the collection of such
accounts, the cashiers, stenographers, and other employees involved in these

Effect on interstate commerce.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Processing generally interrupts the movement of goods
in interstate commerce. Individual coverage may exist on other grounds,
however. The line to be drawn between operations that constitute a mere
incident of the interstate distribution of goods received from outside the
State and those that constitute processing that terminates the prior interstate
movement is a matter of degree. It is not possible to formulate any infallible
test that will serve to resolve every conceivable situation that may arise. It
is not necessarily true that any processing defined as “production” in FLSA Sec
3(j) is sufficient to break the flow of goods in interstate commerce. The test
of what constitutes processing involves a number of factors, including the
complexity of the operation, the change that is made in the goods, and the time
required.</p><p>(b)   Operations that have been held only incidental to
interstate distribution, and which will not stop the flow of interstate
commerce, include: the making of minor adjustments and performing minor services
on new automobiles; the blending of different grades of gasoline; and the
candling, sizing, and packing of eggs.</p><p>(c)   Among operations that have been held to be processing
are: the mixing of materials to make concrete; the making of sandwiches and
other such products from crackers, bread, and the like; the pasteurization and
bottling of unpasteurized beer; the blending of wines; the grinding or blending
of coffee; the dilution, pasteurization, clarification and homogenization of
milk or cream; the bottling of milk; the neutralization and churning of sour
cream to form butter the processing of cottage cheese to improve consistency
and increase fat content; and, the making of chocolate milk.</p>

However, where the terms of an interstate contract of sale call for the

interstate movement is not limited to the transportation that, in the narrowest
view, involves the crossing of a State line. An employee is engaged in

freight, or passengers moving in interstate commerce, are fixed facilities of
interstate commerce. As a general rule, employees engaged in work in or about
such fixed facilities of interstate commerce are subject to the FLSA as they

example, employees of drug stores, lunch counters, newsstands, barbershops, and
shoeshine parlors are not closely enough related to the movement of goods
through the terminals to be regarded as engaged in interstate commerce.</p><p>(c)   A terminal porter who not only keeps the station clean
but also assists passengers with their baggage and employees of an
establishment owning and operating coin-actuated baggage lockers installed in
stations are engaged in a terminal service so closely related to the physical
transportation of goods and passengers in interstate commerce as to be a part

individual basis in any workweek in which they are engaged in:</p><p>(1)  maintaining, servicing, and repairing vehicles which
are used on a regular and recurrent basis to transport goods in interstate
commerce. (This includes not only vehicles used to transport goods directly

such receipt and shipment are so closely related to the movement in interstate
commerce as to be also regarded as engaged in interstate commerce.</p><p>(c)   Employees engaged in maintenance, service, and repair
activities, and the clerical duties connected with the rental and use of vehicles
on a regular basis to transport goods in interstate commerce are engaged in
interstate commerce and the production of goods (vehicles) for interstate

controlling principles.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Employees of a warehouse, the storage facilities of
which are used in the course of interstate transportation and distribution of
goods, are engaged in interstate commerce.</p><p>(b)   The unloading, inspecting, and checking of goods
received at warehouse from outside the State, and the keeping of records with
respect thereto, constitute engagement in interstate commerce.</p><p>(c)   Whether employees engaged in and about a warehouse in
handling goods after their receipt from outside the State are engaged in
interstate commerce, depends upon the disposition and destination of the goods
after they leave the warehouse. In those situations where the flow of
interstate commerce terminates upon receipt of the goods at the warehouse, only
those employees are individually covered whose activities pertain to the
receipt of the goods. In situations where the flow of interstate commerce
continues through or begins after the warehousing operations, all employees are
individually covered who participate in any of the work through which goods are
received, stored, or distributed, or in any activities so closely related
thereto as to be a part thereof.</p><p>(d)   Where goods are received from outside the State and
stored in bulk warehouses, the stream of interstate commerce does not
necessarily end there, but may continue until the goods are delivered from the
warehouse to a dealer or consumer. In the case of subsequent distribution
within the same State, if the goods belong to a wholesaler who will distribute
them to retailers or other wholesalers, the warehouse employees who handle the
goods during their stay in the warehouse and who deliver them to the retailers
or wholesalers, may be engaged in interstate commerce under the principles of
the Jacksonville Paper case. (See FOH 11w08.)</p><p>(e)   Goods that are destined for another State may be
considered to be moving in interstate commerce even prior to their crossing of
a State line. Hence, the temporary storage of such goods may be considered
engagement in interstate commerce, depending upon the circumstances of such
storage with relation to previous and subsequent movement of the goods. All
employees in the ordinary warehouse serving chain stores which receives goods
from outside the State are individually covered even though the distribution
may be entirely intrastate. A similar result will follow where the distribution
of the warehouse or wholesale house is confined to a limited group of
retailers, such as wholesalers who distribute only to members of a particular
association of retail stores.</p>

store.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Employees of a chain store warehouse engaged in
storing out-of-State merchandise for direct shipment to customers of several
retail stores are covered on an individual basis. However, whether a particular
employee is so covered depends upon his or her own activities. Normally,
warehouse employees of such chain stores “are performing wholesale duties in
the very midst of the stream of interstate commerce”, and they “customarily
deal with both incoming and outgoing interstate shipments”. However, if an individual’s
work is in no way concerned with the interstate aspect of his or her employer’s
business, then he or she is not individually covered.</p><p>(b)   A repair and service facility, even though conducted
in a chain store warehouse servicing retail stores, is to be distinguished in
its activities from the process of wholesaling. Employees whose activities are
confined solely to delivery, repair, and servicing of merchandise which has
already reached the retail stores or which has been sold to retail customers by
the retail stores are not individually covered by the FLSA if all of the
merchandise is delivered within the State in which the chain store warehouse is

salvaging, sorting, loading, unloading or otherwise working on or handling
waste material, scrap metal or junk for shipment out of the State, is covered
on an individual basis. For example, the loading of scrap metal on railroad
cars for interstate shipment constitutes engagement in interstate commerce.
Likewise, operations performed on waste paper, rags or metal for shipment,
directly or indirectly out of the State or for use by producers in the
manufacture of goods to be shipped out of the state, such as paper boxes,
reclaimed woolens and the like, is the production of goods for interstate

which ultimately move in interstate commerce.</p><p>(b)   The removal of waste material, scrap metal and junk
from establishments that are engaged in the production of goods for interstate
commerce is covered on an individual basis. The removal of such waste material
is closely related and directly essential to the production of such goods. It
is immaterial that the waste material is picked up at the door of such an
establishment or from the adjoining alley or sidewalk, or that it does not
subsequently move in interstate commerce.</p>

              <p>(a)   Personnel engaged in watching and guarding buildings,
premises, equipment and other goods may be subject to the FLSA as either
engaged in interstate commerce, or in the production of goods for interstate
commerce. Employees engaged in watching or guarding the following instrumentalities
of interstate commerce are engaged in interstate commerce:</p><p>(1)  movable facilities of interstate commerce, such as
trucks, railroad cars, or ships, whether empty or loaded;</p><p>(2)  fixed facilities of interstate commerce, such as
interstate warehouse buildings, freight and passenger terminals, power
transmission buildings, telephone exchanges, and radio stations; and</p><p>(3)  covered construction of the channels of interstate
commerce, such as interstate highways, waterways, and railroad roadbeds. This
is true even though the watchman is employed by an independent protective
agency.</p><p>(b)   watchman who is employed at a fixed facility of
interstate commerce, such as a warehouse or distribution depot devoted to the
receipt and shipment of goods in interstate commerce is covered on an
individual basis. Similarly, an employee who watches goods which by their
nature have not yet come to rest is engaged in activities closely enough
related to interstate commerce to be engagement in interstate commerce. For
example, if he watches trucks freight cars, and boats prior to the unloading of
out-of-State goods, his work is individually covered.</p><p>(c)   Employees engaged in watching or guarding buildings,
premises, equipment, materials, or other goods that are being used in the
production of goods for interstate commerce are subject to the FLSA as being
engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce. They are in
processes or occupations that are closely related and directly essential to the
production of goods watched or guarded.</p><p>(d)   It is not necessary that the production operations
must be carried on at the precise moment that the watching or guarding is done.
If that which the employee guards is used regularly in the day time in the
production of goods for interstate commerce, the night watchman is covered. Nor
is it material that the plant which he or she guards is temporarily shut down,
although for a fairly long period. However, where production has definitely
ceased and no further production is being contemplated, the watching or
guarding cannot be said to be closely related and directly essential to the
production of any goods.</p><p>(e)   Whether a watchman who watches building materials on
construction jobs is individually covered depends upon the nature of the
construction job. In general, the watchman stands in the same position as other
employees, such as carpenters and laborers. Where the other employees are
subject to the Act because they are in processes or occupations that are
closely related and directly essential to the production of goods for
interstate commerce, the guard is individually covered. For example, employees,
including watchmen engaged in the maintenance, repair, reconstruction,
improvement, or extension of facilities used in the production of goods for
interstate commerce are in closely related processes or occupations directly
essential to the production thereof. Similarly, such work in connection with
fixed facilities and channels of interstate commerce, such as warehouse
buildings, freight and passenger terminals, pipeline stations, telephone
exchanges, radio stations, interstate highways, waterways, and railroad
roadbeds, is so closely related to the interstate movement of goods through or
over them as to be engagement in interstate commerce.</p>

              <p>(a)   Employees engaged in activities characteristic of the
wholesaling business may be engaged in interstate commerce by virtue of their
connection with the procurement or receipt of goods received directly from
outside the State, the handling and distribution of goods moving in interstate
commerce, or the original shipment of goods out of the State.</p><p>(b)   Employees of a wholesaler who participate in the sale,
shipment, et cetera, of goods to points outside the State are engaged in
interstate commerce.</p><p>(c)   Employees of wholesalers (with the exception of
employees engaged in work relating to the ordering and receipt of merchandise
from outside the State) are not individually covered, if the wholesaler brings
goods into the State for general distribution to the trade, stores them to
await orders, and then distributes them on order.</p>

              <h3>11w06 - Wholesaling: receipt
of out-of-State goods.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Employees of a wholesaler who are engaged in the
procurement and receipt of goods from outside the State are engaged in
interstate commerce without regard to the nature of the employer’s business or
the subsequent disposition of the goods. This is true whether the goods are
received by the wholesaler or directly by the customer on behalf of whom they
were procured to be shipped. Included within the coverage of the FLSA on this
basis are employees whose work is so closely related to the actual procurement
or receipt of the goods as to be, for all practical purposes, a part thereof.
For example, employees who keep records of interstate purchases and goods
received, maintain the accounts payable ledger, and other allied and receiving
employees, are so closely related to the interstate movement of the goods as to
be engaged in interstate commerce. Moreover, maintenance and custodial
employees of such a wholesale establishment are covered on an individual basis
for similar reasons. For example, maintenance employees engaged in repairing
the materials-handling equipment, the watchman who protects goods prior to
unloading, and the janitor who cleans the office of the wholesaler are likewise
so closely related to the movement of the goods ordered and received as to be
engaged in interstate commerce.</p><p>(b)   The coverage of the employees whose activities are
performed with respect to the out-of-State goods while such goods are in or
about the establishment of the wholesaler is determined by the status of the
goods at the time of the performance of the activity in question. If at that
time the goods are in fact still in the stream of interstate commerce,
performance of work connected therewith by any employee will be either actual
engagement in interstate commerce or so closely related thereto as to be
regarded as part thereof.</p>

              <h3>11w07 - Wholesaling: where
out-of-State goods come to rest.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Out-of-State goods of an intrastate wholesaler do not
come to rest until they reach the destination intended for them by the
importer. Normally, the destination intended for goods received for storage and
subsequent distribution in intrastate commerce is the place where they are held
for future distribution, such as shelves or storage bins, rather than the first
place at which they are set after unloading from the carrier. The fact that
there may be some delay in moving the goods from the point of unloading to the
shelves or bins is an immaterial circumstance which does not alter the results.</p><p>(b)   Thus any employee whose duties relate to the ordering
of goods from other States is subject to the FLSA as engaged in interstate
commerce. This will include not only those who make telephone calls or send
telegrams, or write letters, or handle payments, all in connection with such
purchases, but also employees who keep records of purchases, orders, and
receipts, or in any manner perform work which is materially related to the
purchases.</p><p>(c)   Employees engaged in receiving out-of-State goods are
actually engaged in interstate commerce, and those whose work is materially
related thereto are so closely related to the interstate movement as to be
engaged in interstate commerce.</p><p>(d)   Any employee whose duties includes the performance of
the following types of work, even after the out-of-State goods have been
unloaded and deposited on the unloading platform or warehouse floor, is engaged
in interstate commerce:</p><p>(1)  checking goods against invoices;</p><p>(2)  placing goods on shelves or in storage bins;</p><p>(3)  making reports on missing or damaged goods; or</p><p>(4)  entering articles received in interstate commerce in
the stock book. </p>

              <h3>11w08 - Wholesaling: prior
orders, pre-existent understandings, and anticipation of needs.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The Supreme Court, in the Jacksonville Paper Company
case, has defined those conditions under which goods remain within the channels
of interstate commerce until delivered to the customer level. The first group
comprises those goods purchased by the wholesaler upon the order of a customer
with the definite intention that the goods shall be carried at once to the
customer.</p><p>(b)   The second group comprises those goods obtained by the
wholesaler from the manufacturer or supplier to meet the needs of specified
customers pursuant to some understanding with the customer even though not
necessarily for immediate delivery. The Court ruled that the goods comprising
each of these two groups are within the channels of interstate commerce until
delivery is finally effected to the specific customer, known and intended at
the time of purchase by the wholesaler.</p><p>(c)   The third group comprises those goods the orders for
which have been based, by the wholesaler, on anticipation of the needs of a
stable group of specific customers rather than upon prior orders or
understandings.</p>

              <h3>11w09 - Wholesaling: chain
store distribution.</h3>
              <p>In the American Stores
case, the Court of Appeals held that where the warehouse and the retail stores,
located within the same State, are part of an integrated unit, goods do not
come to rest in the warehouse in the sense that the flow of goods in interstate
commerce has been terminated. Thus, all employees in the ordinary chain store
warehouse receiving goods from outside the State are individually covered, even
though the distribution effected is entirely intrastate. Likewise, the
employees would be individually covered where the distribution of the warehouse
or wholesale house is confined to a limited group of retailers, such as
wholesalers who distribute only to members of a particular association of
retail stores or to a limited number of retailers who handle the particular
product or brand.</p>

interstate shipment by wholesaler.</h3>
              <p>Employees of a
wholesaler who participate in the sale or shipment of goods outside of the
State are engaged in interstate commerce. The movement of the goods is
initiated by the employee who first removes them from the point at which
previously stored for future distribution; all employees whose duties are
thereafter related to such movement are individually covered. This broad group
includes such typical and illustrative occupations as order pickers, checkers,
packers, shipping clerks, loaders, clerical and office employees who keep
records or prepare correspondence relative to either the sale or the movement
of the goods, and maintenance and custodial employees, including watchmen and
janitors.</p>

wholesalers.</h3>
              <p>If, in fact, the
movement of goods in interstate commerce has ceased in the establishment of the
first wholesaler, the subsequent handling of such goods by the employees of the
second wholesaler is not covered on an individual basis, unless or until the second
wholesaler initiates a new movement in interstate commerce. However, if the
goods have remained in interstate commerce through the establishment of the
first wholesaler, the receipt of such goods in the establishment of the second
wholesaler is the same as receiving the goods directly from outside the State
and is therefore individually covered. Similarly, if the second wholesaler
receives the out-of-State goods by direct consignment or by drop-shipment from
their out-of-State source, they are deemed to have been received directly from
outside the State. Those employees who in any manner perform work which is
materially related to the purchase or receipt of such goods prior to their
arrival at their intended destination are covered on an individual basis.</p>

demolition work and in the sale of the salvaged parts are covered on an
individual basis where the employer has reason to believe that part of the
salvaged material will move in interstate commerce or will become part of goods
that are shipped in interstate commerce, whether as a result of a direct sale
by the employer or indirectly as a result of its disposition by his customer.</p><p>(b)   Individual coverage also exists where the employees
are engaged partially or wholly in wrecking buildings as a part of the
reconstruction, remodeling, or expansion of facilities used in the production
of goods for interstate or foreign commerce, whether the employees are engaged
in work at the job site, such as office and clerical workers, watchmen and

employees transporting such equipment to and from the job site</p>
