<h4 id="a00---purpose-and-use-of-foh-chapter-14.">14a00 - Purpose and use of FOH Chapter 14.</h4>
<p>This chapter supplements <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/null'>29 C.F.R. Part 4</a>, which contains the U.S. Department of Labor&#x2019;s regulations and interpretations with respect to the McNamara-O&#x2019;Hara Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended.</p>
<h4 id="a01---the-mcnamara-ohara-service-contract-act-sca-or-the-act.">14a01 - The McNamara-O&#x2019;Hara Service Contract Act (SCA or the Act).</h4>
<p>The SCA (41 U.S.C. &#xA7; 351, et seq.) applies to every contract entered into by the United States or the District of Columbia, the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees. Contractors performing on such Federal service contracts in excess of $2,500 must observe minimum wage and safety and health standards, and maintain certain records. Service employees on covered contracts in excess of $2,500 must be paid not less than the monetary wages and fringe benefits contained in wage determinations issued by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) for the contract work. Such wage and fringe benefit determinations may reflect what has been determined to be prevailing in the locality, or may reflect the wage rates and fringe benefits contained in the predecessor contractor&#x2019;s collective bargaining agreement (CBA), if any, pursuant to Section 4(c) of the SCA. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.'>29 C.F.R. Part 4.</a>)</p>
<h4 id="a02---the-fair-labor-standards-act-flsa.">14a02 - The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).</h4>
<p>The FLSA (29 U.S.C. &#xA7; 201, et seq.) prescribes standards for the basic minimum wage and overtime pay that may affect SCA-covered contracts. The FLSA interacts with the SCA in three key ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Section 2(b)(1) of the SCA provides that no contractor or subcontractor shall pay any employee engaged in performing work on a covered contract less that the minimum wage specified under Section 6(a)(1) of the FLSA. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.159'>29 C.F.R. 4.159</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Section 8(b) of the SCA defines the term &quot;service employee&quot; as any person engaged in the performance of a contract or that portion of a contract subject to the SCA except those employees in bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacities as those terms are defined in the FLSA regulations found at <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/541.'>29 C.F.R. Part 541.</a> (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/41/357'>41 U.S.C. 357(b)</a>; <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.113'>29 C.F.R. 4.113</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Section 6 of the SCA recognizes that other Federal laws, such as the FLSA, may require overtime compensation to be paid to service employees working on or in connection with contracts subject to the SCA. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/41/355'>41 U.S.C. 355</a>; SCA, <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.180'>29 C.F.R. 4.180</a>-4.182; FLSA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/778.'>29 C.F.R. Part 778.</a>)</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="a03---the-contract-work-hours-and-safety-standards-act-cwhssa.">14a03 - The Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA).</h4>
<p>The SCA recognizes that other Federal laws, such as the CWHSSA, may require overtime compensation to be paid to service employees working on or in connection with contracts subject to the SCA. The CWHSSA is more limited in scope than the FLSA and generally applies to government contracts in excess of $100,000 that require or involve the employment of laborers or mechanics, including guards and &#x201C;watchmen.&#x201D; (See SCA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.180'>29 C.F.R. 4.180</a>-4.182; CWHSSA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/5.5'>29 C.F.R. 5.5(b)</a>.)</p>
<p><h4 class="testClass">14a04 - WDOL.gov website.</h4></p>
<p>WDOL.gov (http://www.wdol.gov) provides a single website for access to federal contract labor standards information and wage determinations (WDs) issued under the SCA and the Davis-Bacon Act (DBA). (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.4'>29 C.F.R. 4.4(c)</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="b---general-and-statutory-provisions">14b - GENERAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS</h3>
<h4 id="b00---sca---statutory-provisions.">14b00 - SCA - Statutory provisions. </h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Absent an exemption under Sections 4(b) or 7 of the Act, Section 2(a) mandates that every contract entered into by any agency or instrumentality of the United States or the District of Columbia in excess of $2,500, the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in the United States through the use of service of employees, must contain:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Specified minimum monetary wages (MWs) and fringe benefits (FBs) determined by the Secretary of Labor (S/L) that are based upon wage rates and fringe benefits prevailing in the locality (or, in certain circumstances, the wage rates and fringe benefits contained in a collective bargaining agreement, if any, applicable to employees who performed on a predecessor contract) to be paid to the various classes of service employees employed by the contractor or any subcontractor in performance of the contract or subcontract;</p></li>
<li><p>A requirement that working conditions provided by or under the control of the contractor or subcontractor meet safety and health standards;</p></li>
<li><p>A requirement that notice be given to service employees on the day they commence work of the compensation due them under the minimum wage and fringe benefit provisions of the contract (or that such notice be posted in a prominent place at the worksite); and</p></li>
<li><p>A statement of the wage rates and fringe benefits that would be paid by the contracting agency to the various classes of service employees if such employees were hired directly by the agency to perform the contract work. This statement is included in contracts for informational purposes only.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The remaining sections of the SCA direct DOL to administer and enforce the Act, and give no authority to contracting agencies to issue final coverage determinations. DOL must ultimately decide any issue concerning coverage under the SCA. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/41/351'>41 U.S.C. 351 et seq</a>.; <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.101'>29 C.F.R. 4.101(b)</a>, 4.102.)</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="b01---coverage-general.">14b01 - Coverage &#x2013; general. </h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The SCA applies to contracts entered into by the United States or the District of Columbia, the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.107'>29 C.F.R. 4.107</a>-4.114.)</p></li>
<li><p>Specifications for services in a contract which is not as a whole principally for services are not subject to the SCA. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.111'>29 C.F.R. 4.111(a)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Contracts for services which are performed essentially by employees that qualify for exemption as bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employees under the FLSA and involve only a minor or incidental use of service employees would not require application of the SCA. (See SCA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.113'>29 C.F.R 4.113(a)(3)</a>; FLSA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/541.'>29 C.F.R. Part 541.</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The term &#x201C;contractor&#x201D; as used in the contract clauses required by the SCA also applies to any subcontractors. When a contractor undertakes a contract subject to the SCA, the contractor agrees to assume the obligations that the labor standards will be observed in furnishing the required services. These obligations may not be relieved by shifting all or part of the work to another, and the prime contractor is jointly and severally liable with any subcontractor for any underpayments that constitute a violation of the prime contract. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.114'>29 C.F.R. 4.114</a>.)</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="b02---agency-of-the-united-states-or-district-of-columbia.">14b02 - Agency of the United States or District of Columbia. </h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Section 2(a) of the SCA covers contracts (and any bid specification therefor) &#x201C;entered into by the United States or the District of Columbia,&#x201D; and Section 2(b) applies to contracts entered into &#x201C;with the Federal Government.&#x201D; Within the meaning of these provisions, contracts entered into by the United States and contracts with the Federal government include all contracts to which any agency or instrumentality of the United States Government becomes a party. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.107'>29 C.F.R. 4.107</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Contracts of the District of Columbia include all contracts of all agencies and instrumentalities of the District which procure services for, or on behalf of, the District or under the authority of the District. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.108'>29 C.F.R. 4.108</a>.)</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="b03---contracts-to-furnish-services.">14b03 - Contracts to furnish services. </h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Based on the language of the SCA, if a contract is &#x201C;entered into&#x201D; by or with the Government, and if its principal purpose is &#x201C;to furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees,&#x201D; it is subject to the SCA. (See 41 U.S.C. &#xA7;&#xA0;351(a).)</p></li>
<li><p>The SCA is intended to be applied to a wide variety of service contracts. To illustrate this point, the SCA regulations provide a listing of examples of contracts that have been found to come within its coverage. (See 29 C.F.R. &#xA7; 4.130(a).)</p></li>
<li><p>The nomenclature, type, or particular form of contract used is not determinative of SCA coverage. Contracts can be in writing, the result of competitive bidding, awarded on a cost plus basis to a single source (&#x201C;sole&#x201D; source), a purchase order, or a telephone call to a contractor. (See 29 C.F.R. &#xA7; 4.111(a).)</p></li>
<li><p>Contracts do not have to involve direct services to the government or an agency, nor do they require the expenditure of funds by an agency. Concessionaire contracts in which the contractor provides a service to individual personnel or the general public, for which he or she charges a fee to the user and then remits a portion of sale receipts to the government, are contracts for purposes of the SCA unless exempted.

<li><p>The SCA applies to all persons who actually perform the service work called for by a covered contract, &#x201C;regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a contractor or subcontractor and such person,&#x201D; except those persons expressly exempted from the definition of &#x201C;service employee.&#x201D; If a person is engaged in performing any service work called for under a covered contract, such person must be paid the wage and FBs provided under the Act, irrespective of any alleged &#x201C;independent contractor&#x201D; or non-employment relationship.

<li><p>Employees who do not perform the services required by a contract in excess of $2,500 principally for services, but whose duties are necessary to the performance thereof, as, for example, clerical employees who handle paper work in connection with the contract (such as billing or payrolls), must be paid not less than the MW specified under Section 6(a)(1) of the FLSA assuming such MW obligations apply.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The amount of the contract is not determinative of the Act&#x2019;s coverage although the statutory requirements and the contract clauses are different for contracts in excess of $2,500 and for contracts of a lesser amount.

<li><p>Contracts exceeding $2,500.</p>
<p>In every covered contract in excess of $2,500 or with no definite amount, the agency is required to include the SCA labor standards contract clauses set forth in 29 C.F.R. &#xA7; 4.6. In addition to other matters, such as R/K requirements and a summary of liabilities and penalties for violations, these clauses contain the basic provisions of Sections 2(a)(1) through (4) of the Act relating to: payment of prevailing MW rates, furnishing of FBs, observance of S&amp;H standards, and notice of compensation to employees (posting). In the absence of a WD attached to the contract specifying the prevailing rate or rates to be paid and the FBs to be furnished, the clauses also provide that neither the prime contractor nor any subcontractor shall pay any employees performing work on the contract less than the MW required by Section 6(a)(1) of the FLSA. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.6'>29 C.F.R. 4.6</a>, 4.150, 4.159.)</p></li>
<li><p>The labor standards contract clauses included in the prime contract are by their terms required to be included as well in any subcontract or any lower tier subcontract made thereunder. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.114'>29 C.F.R. 4.114</a>, 4.151.)</p></li>
<li><p>Contracts not exceeding $2,500.</p>
<p>The only clause required in Federal service contracts of $2,500 or less is the clause reflecting the basic provisions of Section 2(b)(1) of the SCA relating to the payment of the MW required by Section 6(a)(1) of the FLSA to employees engaged in performing work on the contract. However, pursuant to Section 18 of the FLSA, no provision of the FLSA shall excuse noncompliance with any federal, state or local law establishing a MW higher than the FLSA MW. WHD staff will not interpret or enforce any law other than those administered by the WHD, and States cannot interpret or enforce the SCA or FLSA. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/41/351'>41 U.S.C. 351(b)(1)</a>; <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.150'>29 C.F.R. 4.150</a>; FOH 32j01.)</p></li>
<li><p>Determining contract amount.</p>
<p>The value of the contract is determined by either the amount to be paid for the service or the amount which the contractor receives for providing the service. For example, concession contracts are considered to be contracts in excess of $2,500 if the contractor&apos;s gross receipts under the contract may exceed $2,500. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.141'>29 C.F.R. 4.141</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>CWHSSA contract clauses.</p>
<p>Any federal contract in excess of $100,000 that requires or involves the employment of &#x201C;laborers&#x201D; and &#x201C;mechanics,&#x201D; including &#x201C;watchmen&#x201D; and guards, is subject to the overtime provisions of CWHSSA. Such contracts, which may include SCA-covered contracts that employ many classes of service employees that fall within the terms &#x201C;laborers&#x201D; and &#x201C;mechanics,&#x201D; should include CWHSSA&#x2019;s contract clauses set forth in <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/5.5'>29 C.F.R. 5.5(b)</a>. However, failure to incorporate the CWHSSA contract clauses into a contract does not preclude CWHSSA coverage.

<li><p>Workers with disabilities &#x2013;</p>
<p>The SCA, like the FLSA, allows an employer to pay apprentices, student-learners, workers with disabilities in competitive employment, and workers with disabilities in rehabilitation facilities at special minimum wages (SMWs) that are less than the prevailing wages required by the WD. The SCA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.6'>29 C.F.R. 4.6(o)</a> instructs the employer to follow the same &quot;conditions and procedures&quot; required for the employment of such workers as are set forth in Section 14 of the FLSA. This regulatory exception is from the prevailing wage only. Employers are still required to pay the full FBs, or equivalent cash payment in lieu of providing FBs, to service employees with disabilities for the work performed. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.6'>29 C.F.R. 4.6(o)(1)</a> and 4.152(c)(2).) A SMW or commensurate wage will be based upon the prevailing wage listed in the applicable SCA WD for the classification of work to be performed on the contract. It will be determined by the individual productivity of the workers with disabilities in proportion to the productivity of experienced workers without disabilities who perform essentially the same type, quality, and quantity of work. (See SCA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.6'>29 C.F.R. 4.6(o)(1)</a>; FLSA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/null'>29 C.F.R. Part 525</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Apprentices &#x2013;</p>
<p>Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the SCA predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State apprenticeship agency that is recognized by DOL, or, if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship, ETA, DOL. The terms and conditions of the approved program will be followed in the employment of apprentices. Wage rates paid apprentices must not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, usually expressed as a percentage of the journeyworker&#x2019;s rate in the applicable WD. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeyworkers employed on the contract work must not be greater than the ratio permitted to the contractor under the registered program. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program must be paid the wage rate and FBs contained in the applicable WD for the journeyworker classification of work actually performed.

<li><p>The regulations provide detailed guidelines for delineating when contracts for major overhaul of equipment would be considered &#x201C;remanufacturing&#x201D; subject to the PCA rather than the SCA. Complete or substantial teardown and overhaul of heavy construction equipment, aircraft, engines, etc., where the Government receives a totally rebuilt end item with a new (or nearly new) life expectancy resulting from processes similar to original manufacturing, will normally be considered &#x201C;remanufacturing&#x201D; subject to the PCA so long as the work is performed in a facility owned and operated by the contractor. Contracts for routine maintenance or repair, inspection, etc., continue to be subject to the SCA. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.117'>29 C.F.R. 4.117</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Contracting agencies are required to initially determine whether work to be performed under a proposed contract would involve principally &#x201C;remanufacturing&#x201D; work or service work based on the guidelines, and incorporate the appropriate PCA or SCA labor standards clauses into the contract prior to soliciting bids. Application of the SCA or PCA to any type of contract not discussed in the regulations will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the Administrator.

<li><p>Contracts for the carriage or transportation of goods or personnel must be actually governed by published tariff rates for such carriage in order for the Section 7(3) exemption to apply.

(See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/41/356'>41 U.S.C. 356(3)</a>; <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.118'>29 C.F.R. 4.118</a>, 4.123(d)(3); FOH 14c00(c).)</p></li>
<li><p>The Section 7(3) exemption does not apply where the principal purpose of the contract is packing, crating, handling, loading, and/or storage of goods prior to, or following, line-haul transportation to the ultimate destination. The fact that substantial local drayage to and from the contractor&#x2019;s establishment may also be required does not alter the fact that the principal purpose of such a contract is other than the carriage of freight. However, if a firm has a separate contract for transportation subject to a published tariff rate, the Section 7(3) exemption would apply to that contract.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Where the principal purpose of a Government contract is to furnish services through the use of service employees, the contract is subject to the SCA regardless of who is the direct beneficiary of the services, or the source of the funds from which the contractor is paid for the service, and irrespective of whether the contractor performs the work in its own establishment, on a Government installation, or elsewhere. The fact that the contract requires or permits the contractor to provide the services directly to individual government personnel as a concessionaire rather than through a contracting agency does not negate SCA coverage. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.133'>29 C.F.R. 4.133(a)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>An administrative exemption is provided in <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.133'>29 C.F.R. 4.133(b)</a> for certain concession contracts, such as those entered into by the National Park Service, including National Forests and in the National Wildlife Refuge System, which are principally for the furnishing of food, lodging, automobile fuel, souvenirs, newspaper stands, and recreational equipment to the general public as opposed to furnishing such services to the United States Government or its personnel. This exemption does not affect a concession contractor&#x2019;s obligation to comply with the labor standards provisions of any other statutes such as the CWHSSA, DBA, and FLSA. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.133'>29 C.F.R. 4.133(b)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Questions arise in distinguishing between a contract whose principal purpose is the furnishing of services through the use of service employees (subject to the SCA) and a contract which is not for the purpose of procuring services, but rather only sets forth general conditions under which persons desiring to transact business with individuals on Government installations may enter and do so. Such agreements are not subject to the SCA.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For example, where the concession contract provides for the use of Government space or equipment on the installation for the activity involved, or prescribes to a significant extent conditions relating to prices, performance, and quality or type of service, the contract would generally be considered to have as its principal purpose the furnishing of services desired by the Government for its personnel, and be subject to the SCA. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.133'>29 C.F.R. 4.133(a)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast, SCA coverage would not be asserted on a concession contract or agreement which merely requires a contractor to comply with general police regulations designed to control traffic, maintain order, and suppress nuisances. SCA coverage would not be asserted where the requirements imposed by the contract or agreement on the contractor are limited to such matters as restricting solicitation or pick-up practices to specified areas on the installation, restricting hours of operation, requiring observance of speed limits, or other rules and regulations generally applicable to those permitted to do business on a Government installation. Also, absent other evidence that the contract&#x2019;s purpose is to secure services, SCA coverage will not be asserted by reason of inclusion in the contract of requirements to ensure the responsibility of the contractor such as bonding or licensing requirements.</p></li>

<li><p>If a vending machine contractor is obligated to furnish, install, stock, and service the vending machines; maintain such machines in efficient working order; make any necessary repairs; and maintain them in a clean, attractive, orderly and sanitary condition, the contract would be subject to the SCA. Under such a contract, the contractor&#x2019;s function is primarily that of furnishing a service, rather than a mere sale of supplies since it contemplates a continuing use of service employees to carry out the contract. The question of who owns the items available from the machines at the time a purchase is made is immaterial to the application of the SCA.</p></li>
<li><p>If a contractor has an agreement as described in (a) above where a continuing use of service employees is involved, the delivery route personnel and any employees performing any servicing of the machines would be covered by the SCA. Additionally, it is the position of WH that the production employees&#x2019; work involves the performance of duties necessary to the accomplishment of the contract and such employees must be paid not less than the MW required by Section 2(b) of the Act. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.153'>29 C.F.R. 4.153</a>.)</p></li>

<h4 id="g00---segregation-sca-covered-and-non-covered-work.">14g00 - Segregation: SCA-covered and non-covered work. </h4>
<p>If a contractor desires to segregate covered work from non-covered work under the SCA for purposes of applying the SCA WD, the contractor must identify such covered work accurately in the records or by other means. In this regard, an arbitrary assignment of time on the basis of a formula, as between covered and non-covered work, is not sufficient. However, if the contractor does not wish to keep detailed hour-by-hour records for segregation purposes under the SCA, records can be segregated on the wider basis of departments, work shifts, days, or weeks in which covered work was performed. For example, if on a given day no Government work was performed by a laundry under its contract, this day can be segregated and shown in the records. Similarly, if on a given day only noontime meals were provided by a restaurant under a covered contract to furnish meals to military personnel, employment on the night shift could be segregated. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.169'>29 C.F.R. 4.169</a>, 4.179.)</p>
<h4 id="g01---segregation-employees-performing-work-in-more-than-one-classification.">14g01 - Segregation: employees performing work in more than one classification.</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>If an employee performs work which can be clearly identified and segregated under more than one job classification listed in the applicable WD, i.e., working in different capacities in the performance of the contract, then the time spent by the employee in work properly related to each classification should be segregated and paid according to the wage rate specified for each classification. If the contractor cannot provide affirmative proof (employer records) of the hours spent in each class of work, then the contractor must pay the employee the highest of such rates for all hours worked in the workweek. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.169'>29 C.F.R. 4.169</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Working in &#x201C;different capacities&#x201D; applies only to work in different job classifications (e.g., janitors and window cleaners as defined in the SCA Directory of Occupations), not to levels within the same job classification (e.g., security guards I and II as defined in the SCA Directory of Occupations). Thus, for example, segregating work performed by an employee as security guard I and II would not be permitted. In such a situation, the employee must be paid the highest rate listed in the WD for security guards (i.e., security guard II rate) for all hours worked in the workweek on the covered contract.</p></li>

<h4 id="g02---security-guard-services---compensability-of-training-time.">14g02 - Security guard services - compensability of training time. </h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Where a covered contract dictates that persons are required to complete certain training before performing on the contract as security guards, such persons are considered employees of the contractor while undergoing such training and time spent in training is compensable hours worked as described below. Whether this training is of limited application or more general in nature (e.g., State-mandated training courses), it cannot be considered &#x201C;voluntary&#x201D; within the meaning of the FLSA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/785.27'>29 C.F.R. 785.27</a>, since the contractor is obligated to provide employees in order to meet the stipulations in the contract which require the training. Likewise, time spent in training that is specifically required by a covered contract is compensable hours worked even if the training is performed prior to formal contract award or the trainee subsequently is not hired as a contract security guard. The training time for such employees would be compensable work time, but not at the compensation level provided in the applicable WD as the contract services for which wage rates and fringe benefits are specified in the applicable WD are not being performed. The contractor must pay wages for this training time at rates not less than the MW specified under Section 6(a)(1) of the FLSA and Section 2(b)(1) of the SCA, unless otherwise specified in the applicable WD.

<h4 id="g03---mail-haul-contracts-hours-worked-issues.">14g03 - Mail haul contracts hours worked issues. </h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The basic principles for determining hours worked by a truck driver on duty for 24 hours or more as set forth in FOH 31b09 and 31b12 are applicable to SCA mail haul truck drivers.</p></li>
<li><p>Time during which an employee is considered on or off duty by the Department of Transportation is not governed by the same principles as apply under the FLSA. The DOT&#x2019;s regulations are concerned primarily with the safe operation of the vehicle and not compensable hours worked. Thus, the off-duty time required by DOT for safety purposes may exceed the amount of sleep time or other non-working time that may be deducted pursuant to FOH 31b09 or 31b12.</p></li>
<li><p>The principles set forth in FLSA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/785.14'>29 C.F.R. 785.14</a> through 785.22 must be applied to determine whether layover or breakdown time is hours worked. Where such time is compensable hours worked and occurs on an SCA contract, it must be paid at a rate not less than the applicable SCA WD rate for drivers since such time is intrinsically related to contract work. If a contractor chooses to pay for layover and breakdown time, which would otherwise not be considered hours worked under FLSA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/null'>29 C.F.R. 785</a>, for the purpose of not breaking a driver&#x2019;s continuous tour of duty on tours of 24 hours or more, then such time must also be paid at the applicable SCA WD rate.</p></li>
<li><p>WH considers the totality of the circumstances in determining whether layover or breakdown time is hours worked. Small remote towns with few amenities often do not provide an opportunity for an employee to use the time effectively for his own purposes. In such cases, the layover or breakdown time would be considered hours worked and compensation must be no less than the SCA WD rate.</p></li>
<li><p>Overtime exemption applicable to mail haul contracts.</p>
<p>Section 13(b)(1) of the FLSA provides an overtime exemption for employees who are within the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to Section 204 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935. On June 14, 1972, the Department of Transportation published a notice in the Federal Register (37 Fed. Reg. 11781) asserting its power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service for contract mail haulers who operate in interstate or foreign commerce.</p>
<p>The FLSA&#x2019;s &#xA7;&#xA0;13(b)(1) exemption may therefore apply to certain employees of contract mail haulers, provided the tests for that exemption are met. See 29 C.F.R. &#xA7; 782.8(b). Note, however, that drivers, driver&#x2019;s helpers, loaders, and mechanics, whose duties affect the safety of operation of a vehicle engaged in transportation on public highways in interstate or foreign commerce and who would otherwise satisfy the exemption, are nonetheless required to be paid overtime compensation if the vehicle used for mail haul purposes weighs 10,000 pounds or less. This is known as the &#x201C;small vehicle exception&#x201D; to the motor carrier exemption. The small vehicle exception applies and overtime pay is due to an employee in any workweek when the employee&#x2019;s work, &#x201C;in whole or in part,&#x201D; affects the safety of operation of a small vehicle. The phrase &#x201C;in whole or in part&#x201D; means an employee who performs such duties involving small vehicles for the entire week or part of the week must receive overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in that workweek.</p>
<p>Note that the small vehicle exception will not apply to certain vehicles A) designed or used to transport more than 8 passengers (including driver) for compensation, B) designed or used to transport more than 15 passengers (including driver) and not used to transport passengers for compensation, or C) used in transporting hazardous material requiring placarding under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation. See Fact Sheet #19 and FAB 2010-2.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, the CWHSSA exempts all Federal contracts &quot;for transportation by land, air or water&quot; from its provisions for overtime pay. The overtime provisions of this statute would also not apply to employees working on USPS mail hauling contracts. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/40/3701'>40 U.S.C. 3701(b)(3)</a>; FOH 15i00(2) &amp; 15i01(c).)</p></li>
<li><p>Applicable wage rate.</p>
<p>The wage rate applicable to mail haul truck drivers is based upon the point of origin of the route required by the contract. This point of origin is commonly referred to as the &#x201C;head out&#x201D; point. The &#x201C;head out&#x201D; rate is applicable to all drivers who work on the contract regardless of where they may start their portion of the route.</p></li>

<h4 id="g04---cost-of-furnishing-and-maintaining-uniforms.">14g04 - Cost of furnishing and maintaining uniforms. </h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Employees performing on most SCA food service, security guard service, nursing home service, and janitorial service contracts are required by the employer, by the employer&#x2019;s Government contract, by law, or by the nature of the work, to wear clean uniforms and/or related apparel or equipment. In such situations, the financial cost of furnishing and maintaining (except in the case of wash and wear uniforms, see (d) below) clean uniforms or equipment is considered to be a business expense of the employer and may not be imposed upon the employees if to do so would reduce their wages below the FLSA MW or SCA prevailing wage rate (or FLSA or CWHSSA OT). Where the MW (or OT) is diminished below the required rate, the employer must bear the cost of providing clean uniforms and equipment up to the amount of any such deficiency. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.168'>29 C.F.R. 4.168(b)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>A determination of the cost of furnishing the uniforms (and related equipment) itself presents no problem. If the employee is required to furnish the uniform, the actual cost incurred by the employee shall be used to ascertain whether a MW or OT violation has occurred. The same is true where a commercial laundry or uniform rental services is utilized. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.168'>29 C.F.R. 4.168(b)</a>; FOH 30c12.)</p></li>
<li><p>Where uniform cleaning and maintenance is the responsibility of the employee, a contractor may satisfy its wage obligation under the Act by reimbursing employees $3.35/wk or $.67/day for such cleaning and maintenance. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.168'>29 C.F.R. 4.168(b)(1)(ii)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>There generally is no requirement that employees be reimbursed where the uniforms furnished are made of &#x201C;wash and wear&#x201D; materials which may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments and require no special treatment such as daily washing, dry cleaning or commercial laundering. This limitation does not apply, however, where a different provision has been set forth in the applicable WD. In the case of WDs issued under Section 4(c) of the Act for successor contracts, the amount established by the parties to the predecessor CBA is deemed to be the cost of laundering uniforms.

(See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.163'>29 C.F.R. 4.163(h)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Under Section 4(c), the predecessor contractor&#x2019;s existing CBA provides the basis for the WD applicable to the successor contract. If the CBA is no longer binding on the parties, e.g., as a result of union decertification or a legitimate impasse recognized by the National Labor Relations Act, the successorship requirements of Section 4(c) would be broken. The CBA rates would not apply to the successor contract, but would continue to apply throughout the contract period during which the decertification or impasse was reached.</p></li>
<li><p>Pursuant to Section 4(b) of the SCA, a variation limits the self-executing application of Section 4(c) for new and changed CBAs entered into by the incumbent contractor such that a new or changed CBA is not effective for successorship purposes if: (1) in the case of a successor contract for which bids have been invited by formal advertising, notice of the terms of the new or changed CBA is received by the contracting agency less than 10 days before the date set for bid opening (provided that the contracting agency finds that there is not reasonable time still available to notify bidders), or (2) for awards of successor contracts to be entered into pursuant to negotiations or resulting from execution of a renewal option or extension, notice of the terms of the new or changed CBA is received by the contracting agency after the award of the successor contract, and the start of contract performance is within 30 days of the award, renewal option, or extension (however, if the contract does not specify a start of performance date within 30 days from the award, and/or performance of such procurement does not begin within this 30-day period, any notice of the terms of the new or changed CBA received by the contracting agency not less than 10 days before commencement of the contract will be effective for purposes of the successor contract under Section 4(c)). This variation will apply only if the contracting agency has given both the incumbent contractor and its employees&#x2019; collective bargaining representative written notification at least 30 days in advance of applicable estimated procurement dates. Estimated procurement dates include bid solicitation, bid opening, date of award, commencement of negotiations, receipt of proposals, or the commencement date of a contract resulting from a negotiation, option, or extension, as the case may be. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.1'>29 C.F.R. 4.1</a>b(b).)</p></li>
<li><p>There are two types of appeals that can be made concerning collectively bargained rates where Section 4(c) applies -- based on substantial variance issues, or based on issues concerning arm&#x2019;s-length negotiations. Both types of appeals are resolved based on administrative proceedings handled by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) pursuant to <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/null'>29 C.F.R. Part 6</a>, and/or the Administrative Review Board (ARB) pursuant to <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/8.'>29 C.F.R.

<h4 id="h02---conformability-of-classificationswage-rates.">14h02 - Conformability of classifications/wage rates. </h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>&#x201C;Conformance&#x201D; is the method used to establish wage rates for classes of service employees to be employed on a covered service contract that are not listed on the WD included in the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the WD). (See 29 C.F.R. &#xA7; 4.6(b)(2).)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Contractors should conform wage rates for any unlisted class of service employee before such an employee performs any contract work and classify unlisted classes in a manner that provides a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between the unlisted class and the classes listed in the WD.</p></li>
<li><p>Conformed wage rates must be paid to all employees in the affected class retroactive to the date such employees commenced any contract work. Such rates are treated as if the rates and classes had been included on the original WD issued for the contract. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.6'>29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(v)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Conformances may not be used to artificially subdivide classes already listed in the WD. For example, a stock clerk as defined in the &#x201C;SCA Directory of Occupations&#x201D; is the same job in terms of knowledge, skills, and duties as the shelf stocker and store worker II. If a stock clerk was listed in the WD, a conformance cannot be based on splitting the job into two jobs and establishing a hybrid classification, e.g., shelf stocker and stock clerk II. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.152'>29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Where WDs list a series of levels within a job classification family, e.g., Engineering Technicians I through VI, the lowest level listed for a job classification family is considered to be the entry level and establishment of a lower level through conformance is not permissible. A conformance cannot establish a job level below the entry level listed in the WD. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.152'>29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Trainee classifications cannot be conformed. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.152'>29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Helper classifications in skilled maintenance trades (e.g., electricians, machinists, automobile mechanics, etc.) cannot be conformed. Helper classifications in skilled maintenance trades whose duties constitute separate and distinct jobs may be used if listed in the WD. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.152'>29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1)</a>.)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Conformance Procedures.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The contractor is required to provide a written report of a proposed conformance, including information as to whether the employees involved or their authorized representative agree or disagree with the conformed wage rates and FBs, to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class begins to perform work on the contract. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.6'>29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(ii)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>The contracting officer, after reviewing the proposed conformance, is required to submit a report that includes the agency&#x2019;s recommendation to the NO/Division of Wage Determinations/Branch of Service Contract Wage Determinations for review. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.6'>29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(ii)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>The Branch will approve, modify or disapprove the proposed conformance or render a final determination within 30 days of receipt of the report or will notify the contracting agency that additional time is necessary to review the report. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.6'>29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(ii)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>The Branch will transmit the final determination to the contracting officer who is to promptly notify the contractor of the action taken. The contractor is required to furnish each affected employee with a copy of the conformance determination or post it at the job site as part of the WD. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.6'>29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(iii)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>If the contracting agency does not agree to submit a conformance, the WHD may initiate action pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#xA7; 4.6(b)(2)(vi) for a final determination of a proper conformed classification, wage rate and/or FBs.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option or extension of an existing contract, the conformance procedures provide an &#x201C;indexing procedure&#x201D; for previously conformed classifications. A contractor can increase a previously conformed rate by the average percentage increase between the rates listed in the current WD for all classifications to be used on the contract and those rates specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable WD without obtaining WH approval or agreement by the employees involved, but must notify the contracting officer. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.6'>29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(iv)(B)</a>.)</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Any administrative costs (e.g., recordkeeping costs associated with payroll administration) incurred by a contractor directly in providing FB plans are considered business expenses of the firm and not contributions made on behalf of the employees.

<li><p>FB obligations may be discharged by furnishing any equivalent combination of cash or bona fide FBs. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.170'>29 C.F.R. 4.170</a>, 4.177.)</p></li>

<li><p>It is the contractor&#x2019;s responsibility to satisfy the FB obligations set forth in an SCA WD. The contractor may choose the FBs to be provided, whether an employee accepts or refuses the FBs offered. If an employee desires cash payments or benefits other than those chosen by the contractor, that would be a matter for discussion and resolution between the employee and the employer. If the contractor furnished a lesser amount of the FBs called for by the applicable WD, the contractor must furnish the employee with the difference between the amount stated in the WD and the actual cost of the FB which the contractor provided. As set forth in <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.175'>29 C.F.R. 4.175(a)(2)</a>, the contractor may make up the difference in cash to the employee, or furnish equivalent benefits, or a combination thereof.

Terms of the CBA will dictate eligibility requirements, and the amount and extent of such FBs. Since a successor contractor&#x2019;s obligations are governed by the terms of the CBA, any interpretation of the wage and FB provisions of the CBA where they are unclear must be based on the intent of the parties, provided that such interpretation does not violate the law. Some of the principles discussed in the regulations regarding specific interpretations of the FB provisions of prevailing WDs may not be applicable to WDs issued pursuant to Section 4(c).

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>To be considered &#x201C;bona fide&#x201D; for SCA purposes, a FB plan, fund, or program must constitute a legally enforceable obligation which meets certain criteria. The plan, fund, or program must be compliant with the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), laws and regulations enforced by the IRS, and State insurance laws, and contributions must be made irrevocably to a trustee or third person pursuant to an insurance agreement, trust, or other funded arrangement.

<li><p>Unfunded, self-insured FB plans under which a contractor allegedly makes &#x201C;out of pocket&#x201D; payments to provide benefits for employees as costs are incurred, rather than making irrevocable contributions to a trust or other funded arrangements, are not normally considered &#x201C;bona fide&#x201D; plans or equivalent benefits except for plans to provide paid vacation and holiday FBs.

<li><p>Under certain conditions, a contractor may request approval by the Administrator of an unfunded self-insured plan in order to allow credit for payments under such a plan in meeting the FB requirements of the Act. The purpose of seeking advance approval is to avoid situations involving unfunded plans where monies allegedly allocated by a contractor to provide FBs are used for other purposes or are recouped without actually furnishing any benefits. This procedure is not intended to prohibit self-insured plans where irrevocable payments are made pursuant to a trust or other funded arrangement and other conditions are met.

<p>Most prevailing WDs require an employer to furnish employees a specified amount of paid vacation upon completion of a specific length of service with a contractor or successor; e.g., &#x201C;one week paid vacation after one year of service with a contractor or successor&#x201D; or &#x201C;one week&#x2019;s paid vacation after one year of service.&#x201D; Unless specified otherwise in an applicable WD, the following two factors must be taken into consideration in determining when an employee has completed the required length of service to be eligible for vacation benefits:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The total length of time spent by an employee in the continuous service of the present (successor) contractor, including both the time spent performing commercial work and the time spent performing on the Government contract(s) itself. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.173'>29 C.F.R. 4.173(a)(1)(i)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Where applicable, the total length of time spent in any capacity as an employee in the continuous service of any predecessor contractor(s) who carried out similar contract functions at the same Federal facility. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.173'>29 C.F.R. 4.173(a)(1)(ii)</a>.)</p>
<p>However, prior service as a Federal employee is not counted toward an employee&#x2019;s eligibility for vacation benefits under the applicable WD. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.173'>29 C.F.R. 4.173(a)(3)</a>.)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Eligibility requirement - continuous service.</p>
<p>Under the principles set forth above, if an employee&#x2019;s total length of service adds up to at least one year, the employee is eligible for the specified amount of vacation with pay provided in the WD. The term &#x201C;continuous service&#x201D; does not require the combination of two entirely separate periods of employment where there has been a break in service. Whether or not there is a break in the continuity of service so as to make an employee ineligible for a vacation benefit is dependent upon all the facts in the particular case. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.173'>29 C.F.R. 4.173(b)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Accrual or vesting and payment of vacation benefits.</p>
<p>Where a prevailing WD specifies &#x201C;one week paid vacation after one year of service with a contractor or successor,&#x201D; an employee who renders the &#x201C;one year of service&#x201D; continuously becomes eligible for the &#x201C;one week paid vacation&#x201D; (i.e., 40 hours of paid vacation, unless otherwise specified in an applicable WD) upon his/her anniversary date of employment and upon each succeeding anniversary date thereafter. There is no accrual or vesting of vacation eligibility before the employee&#x2019;s anniversary date of employment, and no segment of time smaller than one year need be considered in computing the employer&#x2019;s vacation liability, unless otherwise specifically provided for in a particular WD. The vacation benefits need not be provided by the employer on the date of vesting. However, the required benefit must be furnished before the employee&#x2019;s next anniversary date, before the current contract is completed, or before the employee terminates employment, whichever occurs first. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.173'>29 C.F.R. 4.173(c)(2)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Contractor liability for vacation benefits.</p>
<p>The liability for an employee&#x2019;s vacation is not prorated among contractors unless specifically provided for in a particular WD. The contractor by whom a person is employed at the time the vacation right vests, i.e., on the employee&#x2019;s anniversary date of employment, must provide the full benefit required by the applicable WD on that date before the employee&#x2019;s next anniversary date, before the current contract is completed, or before the employee terminates employment, whichever occurs first. Thus, vacation benefits must be complied with in full on an annual basis. Any unused vacation benefits may not be &#x201C;carried over&#x201D; from year to year. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.173'>29 C.F.R. 4.173(c)</a>-(d).)</p></li>
<li><p>Certified listing of employee anniversary dates.</p>
<p>In the case of a contract performed at a Federal facility where employees may be retained by a succeeding contractor, <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.6'>29 C.F.R. 4.6(1)(2)</a> provides that the incumbent prime contractor must furnish a certified list of all service employees on the contractor&#x2019;s or subcontractor&#x2019;s payroll during the last month of the contract, together with the anniversary dates of employment (with the incumbent as well as predecessor contractors) of each such employee, to the contracting officer not less than 10 days before contract completion. A copy of this list is to be provided to the successor contractor for determining employee eligibility for vacation FBs which are based on length of service with predecessor contractors (where such benefit is required by an applicable WD). Failure to obtain such employment data does not relieve a contractor from any obligation to provide vacation benefits. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.173'>29 C.F.R. 4.173(d)(2)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Rate applicable to computation of vacation benefits.</p>
<p>The rate applicable to the computation of vacation benefits is the applicable WD rate or employee&#x2019;s regular rate of pay, whichever is higher, at the time the vacation benefit is provided or a cash equivalent is paid. If an applicable WD requires that the hourly wage rate be increased during the period of the contract, the rate applicable to the computation of any required vacation benefits is the hourly rate in effect in the w/w in which the actual paid vacation is provided or the equivalent is paid, as the case may be, and would not be the average of two hourly rates. This rule would not apply to situations where a WD specified a different method of computation and the rate to be used. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.173'>29 C.F.R. 4.173(e)(1)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Cash equivalent for vacation.</p>
<p>Where an employer elects to pay an hourly cash equivalent in lieu of a paid vacation, which is computed in accordance with <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.177'>29 C.F.R. 4.177(c)(5)</a>, such payments need commence only after the employee has satisfied the &#x201C;after one year of service&#x201D; requirement (in cases where there is such an eligibility requirement). However, should the employee terminate employment for any reason before receiving the full amount of vested vacation benefits due, the employee must be paid the full amount of any difference remaining as a final cash payment. The rate applicable to the computation of cash equivalents for vacation benefits is the hourly wage rate in effect at the time such equivalent payments are actually made. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.173'>29 C.F.R. 4.173(c)(1)</a> and (e)(1).)</p></li>
</ol>
<p><h4 class="testClass">14j04 - Holiday pay. </h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Most prevailing WDs list a specific number of named holidays for which payment is required. A full-time employee who is eligible to receive payment for a named holiday must receive a full day&#x2019;s pay up to 8 hours unless a different standard is used in the WD, such as one reflecting CBA benefit requirements. A full-time employee who works on the day designated as a holiday must be paid, in addition to the amount he/she ordinarily would be entitled to for that day&#x2019;s work, the cash equivalent of a full-day&#x2019;s pay up to 8 hours, or be furnished another day off with pay. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.174'>29 C.F.R. 4.174(c)(1)</a>-(2).)</p></li>
<li><p>An employee&#x2019;s entitlement to holiday pay fully vests by working in the w/w in which the named holiday occurs. Accordingly, any employee who is terminated before receiving the full amount of holiday benefits due must be paid the holiday benefits as a final cash payment. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.174'>29 C.F.R. 4.174(c)(4)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>If the applicable WD does not include a paid holiday provision for any day declared by the U.S. President to be a holiday, or for any work day where the Federal facility is closed such as due to inclement weather, the contractor is not required to pay covered service employees who take that day off. Any pay provided would be a matter of discretion for the contractor, and contract payments for such time not worked would be a procurement matter within the purview of the contracting agency.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="j05---temporary-and-part-time-employees.">14j05 - Temporary and part-time employees. </h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The SCA makes no distinction between temporary, part-time, and full-time employees. In the absence of express limitations, the FBs specified in the WD apply to all temporary and part-time service employees engaged in covered work. However, in general, temporary and part-time employees are only entitled to an amount of the FBs specified in the WD which is proportionate (i.e., a pro rata share) to the amount of time spent in covered work. Unless otherwise specified in the WD, vacation and holiday benefits are based upon a full-time schedule that consists of 40 hours a week or eight hours a day. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.165'>29 C.F.R. 4.165(a)(2)</a>, 4.176(a); FOH 14i00(c).)</p></li>
<li><p>Holiday obligations to temporary and part-time employees who work an irregular schedule of hours may be discharged by paying such employees a proportion of the holiday benefits due full-time employees based on the number of hours the temporary and part-time employee worked in the w/w prior to the w/w in which the holiday occurs. With respect to vacation obligations, the number of hours such employee worked in the year preceding the employee&#x2019;s anniversary date of employment may be utilized to determine vacation benefits due. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.176'>29 C.F.R. 4.176(a)(3)</a>.)</p></li>

<h4 id="j06---health-and-welfare-hw-and-pension-payments.">14j06 - Health and welfare (H&amp;W) and pension payments. </h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>As set forth in AAM No. 188, a single &#x201C;prevailing&#x201D; nationwide H&amp;W rate method has been established for determining FB requirements to be incorporated in most SCA WDs. The single rate is generally updated once a year based upon data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Employment Cost Index (ECI) summary of Employer Cost for Employee Compensation. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.52'>29 C.F.R. 4.52(a)</a>, 4.175.)</p></li>
<li><p>&#x201C;Fixed cost&#x201D; per employee H&amp;W FBs (<a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.175'>29 C.F.R. 4.175(a)</a>).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Most prevailing WDs containing H&amp;W and/or pension requirements specify a fixed payment per hour on behalf of each service employee. This FB is due each service employee on the basis of &#x201C;all hours paid for,&#x201D; including paid vacations, holidays, and sick leave, up to a maximum of 40 hours per week and 2,080 hours per year. Payments are specified on the WD in hourly, weekly, and monthly amounts.</p></li>
<li><p>If a WD specifies a FB that can be obtained for less than the amount of contribution required on the WD, the employer must make up the difference in cash to the employee, or furnish equivalent benefits, or a combination thereof. The FBs and cash equivalent payments under the &#x201C;fixed cost&#x201D; per employee benefit requirement may be made in varying amounts to employees, provided the total amount paid by the contractor for FBs and/or cash equivalents to each individual employee is at least the amount required by the WD.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>&#x201C;Average cost&#x201D; H&amp;W FBs (<a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.175'>29 C.F.R. 4.175(b)</a>.)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Some WDs specifically provide for H&amp;W and/or pension benefits in terms of average cost. In such cases, a contractor&#x2019;s contributions per employee to a &#x201C;bona fide&#x201D; plan are permitted to vary, depending upon the individual employee&#x2019;s marital or employment status. It is also possible under the &#x201C;average cost&#x201D; concept for some employees to not receive any FBs.</p></li>
<li><p>The contractor&#x2019;s total contributions for all service employees enrolled in the plan must average at least the WD requirements per hour per service employee. In determining average cost, &#x201C;all hours worked,&#x201D; including overtime hours, for all service employees that were employed on the contract during the payment period must be counted. The term &#x201C;all hours worked&#x201D; does not include paid leave hours, such as vacations, holidays, or sick leave. It also does not cover any unpaid leave time.</p></li>
<li><p>The contractor&#x2019;s total contributions for all service employees enrolled in the FB plan(s) must average at least the FB obligation stated in the WD. The types and amounts of benefits (if any) provided, and the eligibility requirements for service employees to participate in a FB plan, are decided by the employer.</p></li>
<li><p>If the contractor&#x2019;s contributions average less than the amount required during a payment period, the contractor must make up the deficiency by providing cash equivalent payments or equivalent FB payments to all service employees who worked on the contract during the payment period. However, cash equivalent payments under the &#x201C;average cost&#x201D; FB requirements can only be made in an amount determined to be deficient after payments have been made to the FB plans, and then must be made equally to all service employees based upon their hours worked. A contractor cannot make cash equivalent payments to some employees and not to others, nor can a contractor pay different cash amounts to employees under the same contract. A contractor must pay the same amount of cash equivalent payments per hour worked to all employees. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.175'>29 C.F.R. 4.175(b)</a>.)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Some H&amp;W and pension plans contain eligibility exclusions for certain employees. Also, employees receiving benefits through participation in plans of an employer other than the contractor or by a spouse&#x2019;s employer may be prevented from receiving benefits from the contractor&#x2019;s plan because of prohibitions against &#x201C;double coverage.&#x201D; While such exclusions do not invalidate an otherwise bona fide plan, the employees excluded from participation in the plan must be furnished equivalent bona fide FBs or be paid a cash equivalent payment during the period they are not eligible, or choose not to participate in the plan. An employee who desires to opt-out of the contractor&#x2019;s health plan must demonstrate that his or her other coverage specifically prohibits double coverage in writing. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.175'>29 C.F.R. 4.175(c)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>It is not required that all employees participating in a FB plan be entitled to receive payments from the plan at all times. For example, a contractor may be permitted to claim credit for contributions made to FB plans on behalf of participating employees during periods of time when they may not be entitled to receive benefits (e.g., a 30-day &#x201C;waiting period&#x201D; under some insurance plans for newly hired employees). If no contributions are made for such employees, then no credit may be taken toward the contractor&#x2019;s FB obligations. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.175'>29 C.F.R. 4.175(c)(2)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Payments to a &#x201C;bona fide&#x201D; H&amp;W or pension insurance plan or trust program may be made on a periodic basis, but not less often than quarterly. If the plan requires that contributions be made on a monthly basis, then to be in compliance the contractor must reconcile the cost incurred by such contributions against its SCA FB obligations on a monthly (or no less often than monthly) basis. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.175'>29 C.F.R. 4.175(d)(1)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Where the WD specifies a fixed contribution on behalf of each employee, and a contractor exercises the option to make hourly cash equivalent or differential payments, such payments must be made promptly on the regular payday for wages. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.165'>29 C.F.R. 4.165(a)(1)</a>, 4.175(d)(1), 4.177(c)(1).)</p></li>
<li><p>The only restriction the SCA places on pension plans, including 401(k) plans, is that they be &#x201C;bona fide&#x201D; FB plans. Such plans are considered &#x201C;bona fide&#x201D; if they meet the requirements of Section 7(e)(4) of the FLSA. (See FLSA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/778.215'>29 C.F.R. 778.215</a>; SCA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.170'>29 C.F.R. 4.170</a>, 4.171(a).)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Neither the SCA nor its implementing regulations address vesting requirements with respect to retirement plans. However, bona fide plans are required to meet the vesting requirements pursuant to ERISA. (See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.171'>29 C.F.R. 4.171(a)(5)</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Pension plans that define a year&#x2019;s service for vesting purposes in terms of a minimum number of hours worked by a participant and require certain number of years in service for a participant to become fully vested would be in compliance with the SCA so long as the plan&#x2019;s vesting provisions meet ERISA&#x2019;s requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Pension plans often provide that forfeitures of employees who do not vest under the plan will be used to reduce the employer&#x2019;s contribution in the following year. For SCA purposes, an employer may not use forfeitures as a credit towards satisfying the requirements of an applicable WD. To allow an employer to do so would result in the employer&#x2019;s taking double credit for the same contribution. Forfeitures that are allocated to the accounts of remaining eligible participants would, however, be creditable toward meeting FB obligations under the SCA.</p></li>

<li><p>The SCA does not provide for compensation of covered employees at premium rates for overtime hours of work. Section 6 of the Act recognizes that other Federal laws, such as the FLSA and CWHSSA may require such compensation to be paid to employees working on or in connection with SCA-covered contracts. CWHSSA (<a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/40/327'>40 U.S.C. 327</a> - 332) is more limited in scope than the FLSA (<a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/201'>29 U.S.C. 201</a>, et seq.) and generally applies to Federal Government contracts in excess of $100,000 that require or involve the employment of laborers, mechanics, guards, and &#x201C;watchmen.&#x201D; (See SCA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/4.180'>29 C.F.R. 4.180</a> - 4.182; CWHSSA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/5.1'>29 C.F.R. 5.1</a> - 5.17; FLSA <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/null'>29 C.F.R. 778</a>; FOH 15g - k and 32.)</p></li>

<li><p>Neither the FLSA, nor the CWHSSA, preclude any State, territory, or municipality from implementing its own labor standards with respect to minimum wage and overtime compensation. If Federal and State laws have different requirements, a contractor would be obligated to satisfy both sets of standards in order to ensure compliance.
