performed for the farmer by a bona fide independent contractor, the independent

many instances, farm workers are furnished their meals, lodging, and other
facilities. In the ordinary case, for purposes of applying Sec 3(m) (Reg 531),
the employer may treat as wages the reasonable cost or fair value of board,
housing, fuel, and a garden plot furnished the employee. Where such facilities
as a house and garden plot are furnished to a family that has several members
working on the employer’s farm during the year, no more than the amount
representing the reasonable cost to the employer, or the fair value, can be
charged to the entire family occupying the house.</p>

              <p>Numerous
questions have arisen as to the employee-employer relationship in agriculture
where sharecropping arrangements or landlord-tenant agreement provide for
shares of crops as rental payments in farm operations. Sample situations and
comments thereon have been prepared for guidance in resolving such question.
These are included, with an explanation, in WH Publication 1187 which is filed

The stripping of
tobacco in an independent warehouse that prepares the crop for market is not a
practice performed &quot;by a farmer&quot; if performed by employees of the
warehouse, even though the warehouse employs as strippers, the farmers who grew
the tobacco. In a situation where tobacco farmers and their tenants exchange
services in stripping tobacco grown by them, careful examination of the
arrangement is necessary to determine whether the strippers:</p><p>(1) 
Are individually
employed in turn by each farmer (in which event they would be considered as
employed in &quot;agriculture&quot;, if the stripping performed for each farmer
is a subordinate part of his activities), or</p><p>(2) 
Are employed by
the warehouse (in which event the stripping is not performed &quot;by a

of nurseries or florists engaged in caring for plants obtained from other
growers.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
In some cases
nursery operators and florists purchase or secure agricultural or horticultural
commodities, such as rooted cuttings or young plants, from others and it
becomes necessary to determine whether the activities of particular employees
in connection with these commodities constitute primary agriculture, i.e.,
&quot;cultivation, growing.. . .&quot; within the meaning of Sec 3(f). In
making such a determination it is necessary to consider all the facts and circumstances
including whether the operations performed on the plants are calculated to
produce growth to maturity or substantial maturity or whether the operations
are merely designed to care for and preserve the plants while they are on the
employer’s premises. Among the factors to be considered are:</p><p>(1) 
The stage of
development of the plant at the time it is obtained, i.e., whether it is
immature, substantially mature or fully matured; and</p><p>(2) 
The nature and
purpose of operations performed on the plant; and</p><p>(3) 
The length of
time the plant is retained from the time it is obtained to the time of sale or
other disposition and its stage of development at the time.</p><p>(b)  The principles set forth in (a) above
are not hard and fast rules but must be applied in the total fact situation to
aid in determining the actual purpose and result of the activities engaged in
by the employees. The following examples will serve to illustrate the
application of these principles. Where plants are received in a state of
substantial maturity and are merely potted and preserved for a short period of
time prior to sale or other disposition, the activities of employees engaged in
caring for such plants would not be considered &quot;cultivation&quot; or
&quot;growing&quot; within the primary definition of agriculture. This would be
the case where substantially mature trees and shrubs from other nurseries are
planted or &quot;healed in&quot; for later use in landscaping operations. On
the other hand, where rooted cuttings or young plants are received and require
substantial growth to reach maturity and where a root system must be developed
and regular and intensive care such as spraying, watering, and fertilizing must
be performed, the activities of employees performing such operations will be
considered as &quot;cultivation&quot; or &quot;growing&quot; within the
definition. (See also IB 780.205-.209.)</p>

trees, whether wild or planted, are not &quot;agricultural or horticultural
commodities&quot; as these terms are used in Sec 3(f) (see IB 780.115.).
Consequently the planting, tending, cutting, and trimming of Christmas trees
does not constitute &quot;primary agriculture&quot; (see IB 780.208).
Activities in connection with Christmas trees may be considered &quot;secondary

              <h3>20b07 - Pine straw.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Pine straw is the
fresh, undecomposed pine needles that have fallen from pine trees.  It is
produced commercially and collected for use as a mulch and groundcover.  The
raking, gathering, baling and loading of pine straw for commercial purposes is
usually performed in pine stands or plantations, from pine trees being grown
for forestry and lumbering operations.</p><p>(b)  Based on the plain language of the
statute, forestry and lumbering operations are not considered primary
agriculture.</p><p>(c)  
Pine straw
activities generally will not qualify as secondary agriculture, unless all the
activities are performed by a farmer or on a farm in conjunction with the other
farming operations.</p><p>(d)  Since pine straw activities typically
do not qualify as primary or secondary agriculture, the minimum wage and
overtime pay protections of the FLSA will apply to most pine straw workers.</p><p>(e)  
Section 13(b)(28)
exempts from overtime pay “any employee employed in planting or tending trees,
cruising, surveying, or felling timber, or in preparing or transporting logs or
other forestry products to the mill, processing plant, railroad, or other
transportation terminal, if the number of employees employed by his employer in
such forestry or lumbering operations does not exceed eight.”  Pine straw workers
are typically employed in the forestry or lumbering operations described in
this exemption because pine straw is a natural substance of trees and therefore
a “forestry product.”  See 29 USC 213(b)(28).  Pine straw workers will
therefore qualify for the Section 13(b)(28) exemption when the employer employs
eight or fewer pine straw workers.</p><p>(f)  
The FLSA
agricultural child labor standards, allowing pine straw workers under the age
of 16 to perform all pine straw activities except operating and assisting in
operation of a forklift, would generally only apply to pine straw activities if
they qualified as secondary agriculture.  The FLSA child labor provisions for
nonagricultural work prohibit pine straw workers under the age of 16 from
employment in pine straw activities and prohibit those who are 16 and 17 years
old from operating or assisting in the operation of power-driven hoisting
devices, such as forklifts, backhoes, and skid steer loaders.</p><p>(g)  
Since pine straw
activities generally do not qualify as agriculture under the FLSA, employers
may continue to utilize the H-2B temporary worker program as opposed to the
H-2A temporary worker program.</p><p>(h)  See FOH 57k for the application of
MSPA to pine straw workers and FOH 36b07 for the application of the OSH Act
Field Sanitation Standards to pine straw workers.</p>

              <p>(a)  
The term
&quot;outside buyer&quot; as used in Sec 13(b)(5) refers only to employees who
are engaged in buying or contracting to buy, and who are regularly performing
these functions away from their employer’s place of business. The term does not
include buyers who are located and perform their work in fixed establishments,
usually known as buying stations, which are located in the country or in small
rural communities away from the main plant where the goods are processed. Sec
13(b)(5) describes an occupation, rather than specific operations, as the basis
of exemption for the employees involved.</p><p>(b)  The exemption applies to an employee
who has as his or her chief duty or primary function buying, in the sense of
obtaining and soliciting commitments from the persons on whom he calls, to sell
the named commodities. Such an employee will be exempt even though in the
course of his duties he spends substantial portions of his time in such work as
driving over fixed routes and calling on established customers to pick up the
commodities, delivering them to the company plant, returning the empty
containers and delivering payment checks, and other work incidental to his
occupation as an outside buyer. On the other hand, a routeman who merely trucks
commodities is not within the exemption.</p>

characteristic of the occupation or an individual employed as an outside buyer

work is different from work foreign to the occupation, as for example the
picking up of supplies bought by the employer, or the performance of productive

              <h3>20j00 - Enforcement
policy for computing BW when the employer is subject to Sec 7(m), 13(h), (i),
and (j) exemptions.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
When an employer
has failed to pay OT specifically required by Sec 7(a) but could have properly
applied any of the above exemptions to the period when no OT was paid, care
must be taken in determining the extent of liability to assure that he/she is
not given an advantage in applying the exemption retroactively that would not
have been available to an employer who conscientiously applied the exemption
each week as he/she went along. For this reason, WH will be guided by the
following in enforcing the Act:</p><p>(1) 
If the employer
has available during a particular investigation period year any of the
exemptions, but has failed to post the required notice of exemption and has
failed to keep the records as required in Reg 516, Subpart B, it will be
assumed that he has claimed as exempt weeks the first 14 weeks in the year in
which the establishment engaged in operations subject to the exemption and in
which the employer did not pay OT compensation for hours over 40 in a week. If
in any of these first 14 weeks of OT any employee has worked in excess of 10
hours a day or 48 hours in week, without receiving OT pay, BW shall be sought
in these weeks for the employee for hours in excess of 10 or 48 in those weeks.
Such weeks will be counted as weeks of exemption. Of course, when the exempt
weeks are used up, OT is due for hours worked in excess of 40 in all remaining
weeks in the calendar year. (See also FOH 32a01.)</p><p>(2) 
The calendar year
(or period of 52 consecutive weeks) is used in determining the weeks of
exemption irrespective of the fact that some part of a calendar year (or
period) may fall outside a 2-year investigation period. While the Statute of
Limitations may preclude a request for BW for more than a 2-year period of
time, it has no application insofar as the selection of the exempt w/w’s is
concerned. Thus, if a 2-year investigation period started in the latter part of
the calendar year or period, it is possible that all (or some) of the weeks of
exemption for that year or period were used up before the investigation period
started, and no more weeks (or fewer than the specified number of weeks) are
available for the balance of that year or period.</p><p>(b)  The policy regarding BW contained in
FOH 32a01(b) is also applicable to Secs 7(m), 13(h), (i), and (j).</p>

The choice of the
fourteen weeks is a matter that is within the discretion of the employer.
Exemption may be taken, however, only for such w/w’s during which the
operations specified in the Act are carried on and only for those employees who
worked not more than 10 hours in a day or 48 hours in a week, or were
compensated at time and one half their regular rate of pay for hours worked in
excess of 10 a day or 48 a week.</p><p>(b)  The exempt weeks need not run
consecutively. The decision as to each w/w during which the establishment
operated under the exemptions may be made at the end of the w/w, the employees
being paid accordingly, the nature of the exemption taken being recorded on the
payroll, and a notice thereof being posted in accordance with Reg 516.</p>

This Sec provides
a partial OT exemption (up to 10 hours in a workday and up to 48 hours in a w/w
for up to 14 w/w’s in the aggregate in any calendar year) for employees
employed &quot;exclusively to provide services necessary and incidental
to&quot;:</p><p>&quot;(A) . . . the ginning of cotton in an establishment

and the compressing of raw cotton when performed at a cotton warehouse or
compress-warehouse facility, other than one operated in conjunction with a
cotton mill, primarily engaged in storing and compressing;&quot; or</p><p>&quot;(C) . . . the receiving, handling, storing, and

An employer’s use
of the Sec 13(h) exemption for a particular group of employees precludes use of
any other exemption under Secs 7 or 13 for those employees. Such use, however,
does not prohibit utilizing Secs 13(i) or 13(j) for certain other employees
simply because Sec 13(h) is used. Thus, for example, if an employer claims Sec
13(h) for certain employees in the establishment, he or she cannot claim other
Sec 7 or Sec 13 exemptions for them, but can utilize Secs 13(a)(1), 13(i), or
13(j) for non-Sec 13(h) activities by other employees. </p><p>(2) 
The statutory
wording &quot;necessary and incidental&quot; in Sec 13(h) is not analogous in
scope to that of &quot;engaged in&quot; in Secs 13(i) and 13(j) and shall not
be interpreted to have the same meaning and effect. For example, employers
whose employees actually perform the operations described in Sec 13(i) or 13(j)
may claim the exemption for those so engaged. Employers whose employees are
engaged in occupations &quot;necessary and incidental&quot; to work performed
pursuant to Sec 13(i) or 13(j), who work exclusively in such operations and who
work solely in those portions of the premises devoted by their employer to such
operations, may claim exemption(s) provided by Sec 13(h).</p><p>(3) 
Sec 13(h) is more
narrow in its application than the expired Secs 7(c) and 7(d) with respect to
the cotton storing and compressing and cottonseed processing industries.
Pursuant to Reg 526.10(b)(8) and 526.11(b)(1), old Secs 7(c) and 7(d) exempted
entire industries, whereas Secs 13(h)(1)(B) and 13(h)(1)(C) exempt only
individual employees. Sec 13(h) requires that              employees be
&quot;exclusively&quot; involved in specified activities (thus permitting no
tolerances).</p><p>(c)  
Sec 13(h)
provides an exemption for employees performing auxiliary services (services
that are &quot;necessary and incidental&quot; to the named operations) which
are not exempt under Secs 13(i) and 13(j). It also replaces Secs 7(c) and/or
(d) with respect to the operations named in Sec 13(h) which were previously
exempted under Secs 7(c) and/or 7(d). For example employees not actually engaged
in ginning cotton (see IB 780.810) or processing sugar beets, sugar beet
molasses, or sugar cane into sugar (see IB 780.818) may be eligible for the
exemption provided by this Sec.</p>

(repealed 12/31/76) that applied on a calendar-year basis, Sec 13(j), like
former Sec 13(b)(26), is applicable during the active season within a period of
52 consecutive weeks. This means an employer may start his or her exemption
year in any w/w during the active season and can select the Sec 13(j) exemption
weeks available from the rest of the subsequent 51 w/w’s.</p><p>(c)  
Prior to the 1977
amendments (effective 1/1/78), Sec 13(j) replaced 13(b)(26) and the latter
provided a partial OT exemption as illustrated in the following table:</p><div>
