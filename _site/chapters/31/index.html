            <h3>31a00. Employees sent home for lack of work.</h3>
            <p>If
an employee is told upon reporting for work that there is no work available and
is immediately sent home, he/she will not be considered to have spent any time
working. If, however, the employee reports for work at the scheduled place at
the prescribed time and is not immediately sent home but is suffered or
permitted to wait for work after the regular shift was scheduled to begin, the
time spent in waiting between the scheduled commencement of the shift and the
time the employee starts work or is sent home is counted as working time. Some
employment agreements provide for the payment of a minimum number of hours pay
to an employee on those occasions when he/she reports for work and none is
available. Pay arrangements of this kind are discussed in IB 778.220 - 778.222.
(See FOH 32d04.)</p>

            <h3>31a01. Rest periods.</h3>
            <p>(a)  
Rest periods of short duration,
running from 5 minutes to about 20 minutes, are common in industry. They
promote the efficiency of the employee and are customarily paid for as working
time. They must be counted as hours worked.</p><p>(b)  
Where a regular rest period of
known duration is longer than 20 minutes, the waiting time rules apply. In
other words, if the employees are free to go where they please, and the rest
period is long enough to permit the employees to use it for their own purposes,
and if bona fide and not an attempt to evade or circumvent the FLSA or PCA,
such periods are not hours worked.</p><p>(c)  
Unauthorized extensions of
authorized breaks are not counted as hours worked for an employee when the
employer had expressly and unambigously communicated to the employee that:</p><p>(1)  The authorized break may only last for a specific
length of time;</p><p>(2)  Any extension of such break is contrary to the
employer’s rules; and</p><p>(3)  Any extension of such a break will be punished.</p>

            <h3>31a02. Homeworker’s waiting time.</h3>
            <p>If
the employer designates the exact time for reporting and the homeworker reports
at that time and is compelled to wait, the time spent in waiting must be
considered as hours worked. If the homeworker reports at a time which is not
prearranged or at a time other than that specified by the employer and the
employer is not prepared to accept the finished goods and charge out new
material to the homeworker, the time spent in waiting will not be considered as
hours worked.</p><p>1/  This
chapter supplements IB Part 785 and is not of itself a complete statement of
the Division’s position on hours worked.</p>

            <h3>31a03. Idle time during the normal workday while in travel status.</h3>
            <p>When
employees are in travel status and the employer wishes to pay them for idle
hours during which they normally would have worked had they been employed at
their regular job and in their regular place of employment, we will respect the
agreement of the parties and allow them to count the hours as hours worked. The
hours must be counted as hours worked in all respects and they must be taken
into consideration when computing OT.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="31b00"></div>
            <h3>31b00. Less than 24 hours duty.</h3>
            <p>An
employee who is required to be on duty for less than 24 hours is working even
though permitted to sleep or engage in other personal activities when not busy.
For example, a telephone operator who is required to be on duty for specified
hours is working even though permitted to sleep when not answering calls, It
makes no difference that facilities are furnished for sleeping. The employee’s
time is given to the employer. The employee is required to be on duty and the
time is work time.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="31b01"></div>
            <h3>31b01a.           Clothes changing and washup time on a formula basis.</h3>
            <p>An
employer may set up a formula by which employees are allowed given amounts of
time to perform clothes changing and washup activities, provided the time set
is reasonable in relation to the actual time required to perform such
activities. The time allowed will be considered reasonable if a majority of the
employees usually perform the activities within the given time.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="31b02"></div>
            <h3>31b02  Employees residing temporarily on employer’s premises.</h3>
            <p>(a)  
There are certain circumstances
(usually at locations such as hard-to-reach construction jobs, isolated
dredging barges and offshore drilling sites) where practical considerations
make it necessary for employees to remain temporarily on the employer’s
premises and to eat and sleep there during their stay. In such situations, the
employees shall not be considered as on “duty of 24 hours or more” if they have
a regular schedule of hours and thereafter are relieved of duties except for
extra work required by the exigencies of the job. Only the actual working time
need be counted as hours worked.</p><p>(b)  
The rules governing “duty of 24
hours or more” (IB 785.22) are applicable where, from all the conditions of
employment, including the understanding of the parties, it is clear that the
employee is employed to wait rather than waiting to be employed. Among the
factors which would support such a conclusion are:</p><p>(1)  the employee has no regular schedule of hours, or a
schedule in name only, and is required to perform work on a helter-skelter
basis at any time during the day or night; or</p><p>(2)  the employee has a regular schedule of hours but the
unscheduled periods are so cut through with frequent work calls that this time
is not his/her own.</p><p>(c)  
Some employers, such as offshore
oil well drilling contractors, arrange transportation to remote locations in
such a way that two crews having regular work schedules as in (a) above, arrive
at the same time. One crew will ordinarily go to work immediately and the other
must wait through an entire shift (or a substantial portion thereof) before
starting work. At the end of the tour of duty at the worksite, one crew, after
completing its last shift, must wait through the last shift (or a substantial
portion thereof) of the other crew before crews are transported back from the
worksite at the same time. Such waiting time on the initial and terminal days
is as much an integral part of those particular 24-hour periods as the idle
periods between the regular workshifts on the other workdays. Where the
employees are not on call and are completely relieved of duty, such idle time
on the initial and terminal days is not considered hours worked.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="31b04"></div>
            <h3>31b04. Radio announcers and performers.</h3>
            <p>Time
spent by performers, including radio announcers on out-of-stretch (see FOH
32d08a) radio and television programs for which talent fees (as defined in Reg
550) are paid, is not counted as hours worked provided the fee is sufficient to
compensate for the straight time and OT compensation which would normally be
due for such time.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="31b05"></div>
            <h3>31b05. Participation in athletic contests.</h3>
            <p>As
an enforcement policy, Wage-Hour will not consider as hours worked under the
FLSA or PCA any time spent by an employee as a participant in, or as an umpire,

            <h3>31b08. Emergency Government employment and disaster relief work.</h3>
            <p>(a)  
Since persons summoned or called
upon by Government or other public officials, pursuant to statutory authority,
to engage in firefighting, national defense, civil defense, flood control, or
other activities, become in legal effect employees of the State or Federal
Government, the employer whose employees have been so engaged is not required
to consider time spent in such activities as hours worked for the company
during the w/w. Any money paid for such activities need not be included in
determining the regular rate.</p><p>(b)  
Similarly, where contractors are
specifically requested by Federal, State, or local authority under the general
police powers of the Government concerned to furnish employees to render
disaster relief services such as rescuing injured persons, restoring municipal
services, clearing streets, and controlling damage, these contractors and their
employees will be considered employees of the Government and the Act applied in
the same manner as in (a) above. Thus, the time spent on such work need not be
counted as hours worked, and any compensation paid for such emergency work need
not be included in the regular rate. Such services are normally furnished
without compensation to the contractor (or at cost) and the arrangement is
terminated as soon as immediate needs are met.</p><p>(c)  
If a contractor contracts with a
Government agency for work following a disaster, to be performed as a
commercial venture or as part of his/her regular business activity (as
distinguished from (b) above), the Act shall be applied in the regular manner.</p>

            <p>(a)  
Time spent in sleeping berths in
trucks.</p><p>Berths
in trucks are regarded as adequate sleeping facilities for the purposes of IB
785.41 and 785.22. However, this rule applies to sleeping berth time of truck
drivers or helpers only when they are on continuous tours of duty during trips
away from home for a period of 24 hours or more. If the trip begins and ends at
the home station and is performed within one working day (less than 24 hours),
all time on duty on the truck is time worked (except, of course, for bona fide
meal periods) even though some of that time is spent in the sleeping berth.
(FOH 31b00.)</p><p>(b)  
Tours of duty of 24 hours or more
but less than 48 hours.</p><p>FOH
31b12 and IB 785.22 describe excludable sleep time for hours of duty of 24
hours or more. On continuous tours of duty of more than 24 hours but less than
48 hours, one extra hour of sleep time in excess of the maximum 8 hours may be
claimed for each hour beyond 40 that a continuous tour of duty extends,
provided that the employee has actually slept such number of hours. For
example, in a 42-hour continuous tour of duty, no more than 10 hours could be
deducted for sleep time. Similarly, in a 45-hour continuous tour, a maximum of
13 hours could be deducted. However, in the absence of an express or implied
agreement concerning the exclusion of sleep time, the time spent sleeping
constitutes hours worked even though the tour of duty exceeds 24 hours. See
also 31b12.</p><p>(c)  
Continuous tours of duty.</p><p>(1)  As indicated in IB 785.12 through 785.16, waiting or
layover time will be considered off-duty time and not part of the employee’s
hours of work if the employee is completely relieved of all duties and
responsibilities, is permitted to leave the truck or temporary station to go
anywhere, knows in advance that work will not resume until a specified time,
and the period of layover is of sufficient length to be used effectively for
the employee’s own purposes. Thus, no standard rule of thumb, such as “2-hour
layover time” or “4-hour layover time” can be used to unequivocally state that
a layover period of such length has automatically broken a continuous tour of
duty. Whether or not a continuous tour of duty greater than 24 hours is
interrupted by a waiting or layover time is a question of fact. For example, if
a truck driver stops for a layover of 2 hours, but the stopping point happens
to be in a remote location which has no available facilities (restaurants,
etc.), the tour of duty has not been interrupted and the “off-duty” time is
compensable hours worked.</p><p>(2)  With regard to team truck drivers, because of the
special circumstances under which they work, we would not regard a bona fide
layover period as breaking a continuous tour of duty if the employer paid wages
for that period.</p><p>(3)  Time spent in noncompensable bona fide meal periods
and bona fide regularly scheduled sleeping periods would not break a continuous
tour of duty provided that such periods do not exceed the maximum limitations
in 785.22 and the “40-hour rule” set forth in (b) above. (See also 31b12.)</p>

            <p>In
some instances an employee of a newspaper or radio or television station will
read a particular book with the view to a possible book review story for use in
the newspaper or on the air. This presents no problem as to hours worked where
the reading is done in the course of the employee’s regular duties at the establishment
or elsewhere at any time at the employer’s specific request. However, the
reading may be done away from the employer’s establishment and outside duty
hours, such as at the employee’s home in the evening, and on a speculative
basis - that is, with the thought that a book review might be prepared. In such
cases there is a substantial question as to whether the reading was done for
the benefit of the employer or for the pleasure or information of the employee.
In such cases, WH will not assert that such reading is hours worked even though
the book is subsequently reviewed in the newspaper or on the air.</p>

            <p>(a)  
If an employee is required to be
on duty 24 hours or more, the employer and employee may agree to exclude a bona
fide regularly scheduled sleeping period, provided adequate sleeping facilities
are furnished by the employer and the employee can usually enjoy an
uninterrupted night’s sleep. (See IB 785.22.)</p><p>(b)  
It is the position of WH that a
reasonable night’s sleep means that an employee obtains at least five hours of
sleep during the scheduled period. These five hours need not be five continuous
uninterrupted hours of sleep. However, if interruptions are so frequent as to
prevent reasonable periods of sleep totaling not less than five hours, the
entire period would be considered hours worked.</p>

an “on-call” employee performs services for his employer at home and yet has
long periods of uninterrupted leisure during which he can engage in the normal
activities of living, Wage-Hour will accept any reasonable agreement of the
parties for determining the number of hours worked. As an example, this policy
will apply to an “on-call” employee who is required by the employer to remain
at home to receive telephone calls from customers when the company office is
closed. The agreement should take into account not only the actual time spent
in answering the calls but also some allowance for the restriction on the
employee’s freedom to engage in personal activities resulting from the duty of
answering the telephone.</p>

time.</h3>
            <p>(a)  
Where there is a “reasonable
agreement” between employer and employee pursuant to IB 785.23, such an
agreement establishes the hours the employee is considered to work, but precise
R/K regarding hours worked is not required. The employer may keep a time record
showing the schedule adopted in the agreement and indicate that the employee’s
work time generally coincided with the agreement or schedule. If it is found by
the parties that there is significant deviation from the initial agreement, a
new agreement should be reached reflecting the actual facts.</p><p>(b)  
The “reasonable agreement” must be
an employer-employee agreement and not a unilateral decision by the employer.
Such an agreement should normally be in writing in order to preclude any
possible misunderstanding of the terms and conditions of an individual’s
employment. It must take into account not only the time spent working but also
the time when the employee may engage in normal private pursuits, with sufficient
time for eating, sleeping, entertaining, and other periods of complete freedom
from all duties when he or she may leave the premises for personal reasons. The
agreement must also consider such relevant factors as the degree to which the
use of the employee’s personal time is limited or restricted by the conditions
of employment and the extent of interruption to eating and sleeping periods.
However, whether an employee is free to use time for personal pursuits will
depend on the facts in each case, notwithstanding the provisions of any written
agreement.</p>

week.</h3>
            <p>(a)  
The “reasonable agreement”
referred to in IB 785.23 may apply to an employee who resides on the employer’s
premises five days a week, since such employee may be considered as residing on
the employer’s premises “for extended periods of time”. (See Reg 552.102.)</p><p>(b)  
Ordinarily, an employee residing
on the employer’s premises for 120 hours or more in a week would meet the
requirements of (a) above. Where less than 120 hours in a week are spent
residing on the employer’s premises, five consecutive days or nights would also
qualify as residing on the premises “for extended periods of time.” For
example, employees who are on duty from 9 a.m. Monday until 5 p.m. Friday would
also be considered to reside on the employer’s premises. Even though on duty
for less than 120 hours, they are on duty for five consecutive days (Monday
through Friday). The fact that they sleep over only four nights does not alter
this conclusion. Similarly, employees who are on duty from 9 p.m. Monday until
9 a.m. Saturday would also be considered to reside on their employer’s premises
since they are on duty for five consecutive nights (Monday night through Friday
night).</p>

or less, meal time may not be excluded from hours worked in the usual
circumstance. However, where such an employee is completely relieved from duty

would not be included in hours worked for purposes of Sec 7(k).</p>

            <p>Under
Reg 553.222(c), where an employer and employee had agreed that time spent
sleeping be compensable, the employer cannot make unilateral changes in the
agreement in order to exclude sleep time from compensable hours of work and
then consider the employee’s continued employment to be acceptance of such
change. Some form of uncoerced mutual assent is necessary to consider the
parties’ agreement validly changed.</p><p>Reg
553.222(c) does not address the converse, i.e., the procedure for making sleep
time compensable where there was previously an expressed or implied agreement
to exclude such time from compensable hours of work. Consequently, an employee
could unilaterally withdraw his/her consent and the employer would then be
required to compensate the employee for any future sleep time that may occur.
However, the employer would not be required to agree to a continuation of the
same terms and conditions of employment. The employer and employee would be
free to establish new conditions of employment, such as rate of pay, hours of
work, or reassignment. Where employees are represented for collective
bargaining purposes, such changes in the terms or conditions of employment
could be addressed within the collective bargaining process. Non-represented
employees would be left to private agreement between the employer and
themselves.</p>

Whether the time spent in caring
for a team of horses, or for a truck, and driving to and from the job site
outside the employee’s workday is hours worked, depends on the nature of the
hiring agreement.</p><p>(b)  
If under the agreement the
employer has no right to possession of the team or truck away from the job site
but has merely hired the use of the team or truck for the daily working period
at the job site, beginning after the delivery there of the harnessed team or
the truck by the owner and ending when the owner leaves with his team or truck,
the employer obviously has no responsibility for the team or truck outside this
period, and cannot direct what is to be done in the way of caring for it, or
how, where, or by whom it shall be readied for work. In such an event, the care
and transportation of the team or truck would be engaged in by the owner and
not as an employee of the employer Under these circumstances, time spent in those
activities outside the employee’s workday at the job site would not be hours
worked.</p><p>(c)  
On the other hand if the agreement
between the employer and the employee contemplates outright hire of the team or
truck for a period of time so that the owner employee is caring for the team or
truck and transporting it as a mere custodian for the employer to whom it is

worktime For example, it an employee who has gone home after completing his
day’s work is subsequently called out at night to travel a substantial distance
to perform an emergency job for one of his employer’s customers, all time spent
on such travel is working time However, where an employee is given prior
notice, as for example, he is told on Friday that he will be required to work

WHPC is taking no position on

contract, custom or practice. Thus, if all of the time spent in such travel is
paid for, all of it must be counted as hours worked. On the other hand, where

            <h3>31c09. Temporary help firms.</h3>
            <p>The
typical temporary help firm (such as Peakload, Inc. and Manpower, Inc.) is
engaged in supplying workers employed by the firm on an “as needed” basis to
various establishments. A person who desires employment usually registers with
the temporary help firm. For certain types of jobs the registrant usually
voluntarily “shows up” at some central location where he awaits employment
opportunity. If work is available or becomes available, he is sent or taken to
the customer’s establishment. If accepted by the customer, he remains and
performs the work of that employer. At the end of the day, the worker is free
to go home and collect his pay later or to return to the central location to be
paid for his work. The circumstances vary. If the employment understanding
clearly is that the pay or the time of the employee begins and ends at the
customer’s establishment, waiting for assignments at the central location or in
travel from there to the customer’s establishment and return would not be
compensable worktime. In other words, his working time is computed in the same
manner as if he had gone directly from his home to the customer’s establishment
and returned home from there at the end of the day. This would be true even
though he may be assigned to work at the same customer’s establishment for more
than one day.</p><p>ADD the following new Sec to

            <h3>31c10. Compensability of travel time of employees who voluntarily drive
company vehicles between home and work sites.</h3>
            <p>(a)  
Background:</p><p>(1)  In some industries employers utilize somewhat modified
vans or trucks for use by employees who perform service work at a customer’s
home or business establishment. The vehicle provides a necessary means for the
employee to transport needed parts, tools, equipment, etc., to various work
sites during the day. The employer may give employees the opportunity to drive
the vehicle between home and work on a voluntary basis.</p><p>(2)  In some instances, the employee starts the work day by
calling the employer’s dispatcher from home, receiving one or more work
assignments to begin the work day, and traveling directly from home to the
first work site rather than traveling first to the employer’s establishment and
then to the work site. At the end of the day the employee may be required to
call the employer’s dispatcher to advise that the last service call for the day
has been completed and that the employee is leaving the last work site for
home, where the employee parks and locks the vehicle. During this call to the
dispatcher, the employee may or may not receive assignments for the next day.</p><p>(3)  WH policy on the compensability of travel time in such
situations was set forth in an Administrator’s opinion letter dated August 5, 1994.
In light of the concerns expressed by both employers and employees, and the
possible effects of applying this interpretation in a wide variety of
industries, the Secretary of Labor, on October 19, 1994, deferred any WH
efforts to enforce the policy in that opinion letter while a review was
undertaken.</p><p>(b)  
Policy:</p><p>An
Administrator’s opinion letter was issued on April 3, 1995, which withdrew the
August 5, 1994, opinion letter and set forth WH’s position in this matter.
Accordingly, where the following circumstances exist, time spent traveling
between the employee’s home and the first work site of the day and between the
last work site of the day and the employee’s home need not be compensated:</p><p>(1)  driving the employer’s vehicle between the employee’s
home and customers’ work sites at the beginning and end of the workday is
strictly voluntary and not a condition of employment;</p><p>(2)  the vehicle involved is the type of vehicle that would
normally be used for commuting;</p><p>(3)  the employee incurs no costs for driving the employer’s
vehicle or parking it at the employee’s home or elsewhere; and</p><p>(4)  the work sites are within the normal commuting area of
the employer’s establishment.</p>

            <h3>31d00. Ambulance services.</h3>
            <p>(a)  
Numerous hours worked questions
may arise with respect to employees engaged in ambulance services. The most
common are as follows:</p><p>(1)  Less than 24 hours duty. Ambulance employees who are
required to be on duty at their employer’s place of business for periods of
less than 24 hours are working even though they are permitted to sleep or
engage in other personal activities when not busy. (See IB 785.21.) However,
the usual rules with respect to meal periods would apply when they are relieved
of all duties for the purpose of eating meals.</p><p>(2)  Duty of 24 hours or more. (See IB 785.22.) Some
ambulance employees may be required by the employer to be on duty on his
premises for 24 hours or more. The parties may agree to exclude bona fide meal
periods and a regularly scheduled sleeping period of not more than 8 hours,
provided the employer furnishes adequate sleeping facilities and the employee
can usually enjoy uninterrupted sleep during the period. If the sleeping period
is more than 8 hours, only 8 hours may be excluded from hours worked. Any
interruption of the sleeping period to respond to calls must be counted as
hours worked. If the period is interrupted to such an extent that the employee
cannot get a reasonable “night’s sleep”, the entire sleeping period must be
counted as hours worked. For enforcement purposes, the “night’s sleep” will be
considered reasonable if the employee can get at least 5 hours sleep during the
period. Thus, where these tests are met, the actual sleeping time (i.e., not
less than 5 hours and not more than 8 hours) may be excluded from hours worked.
Off-duty periods during which the employee has complete freedom from duties and
may leave the premises for his own purposes may also be excluded.</p><p>(3)  Employees who reside on the employer’s premises
permanently or for extended periods of time. Some ambulance service employees
reside on their employer’s premises. In such cases, the employee is not working
all the time he is on the premises. In determining hours worked, bona fide
off-duty time need not be counted and any reasonable agreement of the parties
which takes into consideration all the pertinent facts will be accepted. (See
IB 785.23.) In the absence of an agreement, the Inv should make a reasonable
determination giving recognition to the facts in the particular case which
indicate the amount of time that the employee does have to eat, sleep, and
devote to his own pursuits.</p><p>(4)  On-call time. Except where the employee is on duty 24
hours or more or resides on the premises, time spent by an employee in an
“on-call” status at his employer’s establishment is hours worked. On the other
hand, where an employee is not required to remain on his employer’s premises
but is free to engage in his own pursuits and merely required to leave word
where he may be reached, the time so spent is not considered to be hours
worked. See IB 785.17.) If the employee does in fact go out on a call, the time
actually spent in making the call including travel time is hours worked. Also,
there may be situations when calls are so frequent or the “on-call” conditions
so restrictive that the employee is not really free to use the intervening
periods for his own benefit. In such cases he may be considered as “engaged to
wait” rather than “waiting to be engaged” and the waiting time would also be
counted as hours worked.</p><p>(5)  Employee who takes ambulance to his home. In the
ordinary case where an employer permits an employee to drive an ambulance to
and from his home for the employee’s own convenience, the time so spent in
driving is not hours worked (see FOH 31c01). If the employee is required to
take the ambulance home in order to be able to respond to calls immediately,
all the time spent in driving would be hours worked. The time the ambulance
remains parked idly outside the employee’s residence, and the employee is free
to engage in his own pursuits subject only to the understanding that he leave
word at his home or with company officials where he may be reached, would not
be regarded as hours worked under the Act. The waiting time would be counted as
hours worked only in situations of the type referred to in the last two
sentences of paragraph (4). If the ambulance is parked at the employee’s home,
the employee would be considered working from the time he sets out on a call
until the time he returns to his home.</p>

            <h3>31d01. Community residences for the mentally retarded. and others in
need of custodial care.</h3>
            <p>(a)  
Employees of these group homes may
have regularly scheduled off-duty periods during the day (for which they are
not paid) which might ordinarily break a continuous tour of duty of 24 hours or
more. Therefore, a question arises as to whether their sleep time can be
deducted from working time.</p><p>(b)  
Full-time houseparents.</p><p>The
facilities in question employ houseparents, as well as relief staff in many
cases, to provide custodial care for individuals who reside at the facilities.
The houseparents sleep overnight, sometimes as many as 5 or 6 days in a row,
after which they get a day or 2 off. In addition, the houseparents may also
have several hours off each afternoon, when they are free to do whatever they
choose, including leaving the premises. They sleep in private quarters separate
from the residents of the group home. Many of these houseparents maintain
permanent residences elsewhere in the community, but others have as their only
residence the facility for the mentally retarded. Where such full-time house
parents meet the standards set forth in FOH 31b20, they are considered to be
residing on the premises in accordance with IB 785.23. Therefore, the sleeptime
rules in IB 785.22 and .23 will be applied.</p><p>(c)  
Relief employees.</p><p>(1)  The relief staff may stay overnight at a facility for
one or more nights a week. During a 24-hour period, these employees may also
have regularly scheduled off-duty time during the day with complete freedom
from all responsibilities. They, too, sleep in private quarters separate from
the residents of the group home.</p><p>(2)  In situations where a community residence employs at
least one employee who resides on the employer’s premises “for extended periods
of time” (see FOH 31b20 and IB 785.23), the employer and a relief employee who
performs essentially the same duties as such full-time employee may enter into
a “reasonable agreement” (see FOH 31(b)(18)(b)) to hours worked. Such an
agreement, entered into in advance of the performance of any work, may provide
that sleeping time of up to 8 hours can be excluded from compensable hours of
work, regardless of the length of the tour of duty involved. Also, a mutually
agreed-upon amount of off-duty time, during which the employee is completely
free from all responsibilities, can be excluded from compensable hours of work.
Since the residents of such facilities are usually on the premises all day on
weekends, the hours worked by weekend relief employees may be significantly
longer than the hours worked by the employees who work weekdays. Agreements
with weekend employees must reflect such differences.</p>
