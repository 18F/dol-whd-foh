              <h3>31a00. Employees sent home for lack of work.</h3>
              <p>If
an employee is told upon reporting for work that there is no work available and
is immediately sent home, he/she will not be considered to have spent any time
working. If, however, the employee reports for work at the scheduled place at
the prescribed time and is not immediately sent home but is suffered or
permitted to wait for work after the regular shift was scheduled to begin, the
time spent in waiting between the scheduled commencement of the shift and the
time the employee starts work or is sent home is counted as working time. Some
employment agreements provide for the payment of a minimum number of hours pay
to an employee on those occasions when he/she reports for work and none is
available. Pay arrangements of this kind are discussed in IB 778.220 - 778.222.

              <p>(a)  
Rest periods of short duration,
running from 5 minutes to about 20 minutes, are common in industry. They
promote the efficiency of the employee and are customarily paid for as working
time. They must be counted as hours worked.</p><p>(b)  
Where a regular rest period of
known duration is longer than 20 minutes, the waiting time rules apply. In
other words, if the employees are free to go where they please, and the rest
period is long enough to permit the employees to use it for their own purposes,
and if bona fide and not an attempt to evade or circumvent the FLSA or PCA,
such periods are not hours worked.</p><p>(c)  
Unauthorized extensions of
authorized breaks are not counted as hours worked for an employee when the
employer had expressly and unambigously communicated to the employee that:</p><p>(1)  The authorized break may only last for a specific
length of time;</p><p>(2)  Any extension of such break is contrary to the
employer’s rules; and</p><p>(3)  Any extension of such a break will be punished.</p>

the employer designates the exact time for reporting and the homeworker reports
at that time and is compelled to wait, the time spent in waiting must be
considered as hours worked. If the homeworker reports at a time which is not
prearranged or at a time other than that specified by the employer and the
employer is not prepared to accept the finished goods and charge out new
material to the homeworker, the time spent in waiting will not be considered as
hours worked.</p><p>1/  This

hours during which they normally would have worked had they been employed at
their regular job and in their regular place of employment, we will respect the
agreement of the parties and allow them to count the hours as hours worked. The
hours must be counted as hours worked in all respects and they must be taken

              <h3>31b02  Employees residing temporarily on employer’s premises.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
There are certain circumstances
(usually at locations such as hard-to-reach construction jobs, isolated
dredging barges and offshore drilling sites) where practical considerations
make it necessary for employees to remain temporarily on the employer’s
premises and to eat and sleep there during their stay. In such situations, the
employees shall not be considered as on “duty of 24 hours or more” if they have
a regular schedule of hours and thereafter are relieved of duties except for
extra work required by the exigencies of the job. Only the actual working time
need be counted as hours worked.</p><p>(b)  
The rules governing “duty of 24
hours or more” (IB 785.22) are applicable where, from all the conditions of
employment, including the understanding of the parties, it is clear that the
employee is employed to wait rather than waiting to be employed. Among the
factors which would support such a conclusion are:</p><p>(1)  the employee has no regular schedule of hours, or a
schedule in name only, and is required to perform work on a helter-skelter
basis at any time during the day or night; or</p><p>(2)  the employee has a regular schedule of hours but the
unscheduled periods are so cut through with frequent work calls that this time
is not his/her own.</p><p>(c)  
Some employers, such as offshore
oil well drilling contractors, arrange transportation to remote locations in
such a way that two crews having regular work schedules as in (a) above, arrive
at the same time. One crew will ordinarily go to work immediately and the other
must wait through an entire shift (or a substantial portion thereof) before
starting work. At the end of the tour of duty at the worksite, one crew, after
completing its last shift, must wait through the last shift (or a substantial
portion thereof) of the other crew before crews are transported back from the
worksite at the same time. Such waiting time on the initial and terminal days
is as much an integral part of those particular 24-hour periods as the idle
periods between the regular workshifts on the other workdays. Where the
employees are not on call and are completely relieved of duty, such idle time
on the initial and terminal days is not considered hours worked.</p>

              <h3>31b08. Emergency Government employment and disaster relief work.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Since persons summoned or called
upon by Government or other public officials, pursuant to statutory authority,
to engage in firefighting, national defense, civil defense, flood control, or
other activities, become in legal effect employees of the State or Federal
Government, the employer whose employees have been so engaged is not required
to consider time spent in such activities as hours worked for the company
during the w/w. Any money paid for such activities need not be included in
determining the regular rate.</p><p>(b)  
Similarly, where contractors are
specifically requested by Federal, State, or local authority under the general
police powers of the Government concerned to furnish employees to render
disaster relief services such as rescuing injured persons, restoring municipal
services, clearing streets, and controlling damage, these contractors and their
employees will be considered employees of the Government and the Act applied in
the same manner as in (a) above. Thus, the time spent on such work need not be
counted as hours worked, and any compensation paid for such emergency work need
not be included in the regular rate. Such services are normally furnished
without compensation to the contractor (or at cost) and the arrangement is
terminated as soon as immediate needs are met.</p><p>(c)  
If a contractor contracts with a
Government agency for work following a disaster, to be performed as a
commercial venture or as part of his/her regular business activity (as
distinguished from (b) above), the Act shall be applied in the regular manner.</p>

              <p>(a)  
Time spent in sleeping berths in
trucks.</p><p>Berths
in trucks are regarded as adequate sleeping facilities for the purposes of IB
785.41 and 785.22. However, this rule applies to sleeping berth time of truck
drivers or helpers only when they are on continuous tours of duty during trips
away from home for a period of 24 hours or more. If the trip begins and ends at
the home station and is performed within one working day (less than 24 hours),
all time on duty on the truck is time worked (except, of course, for bona fide
meal periods) even though some of that time is spent in the sleeping berth.
(FOH 31b00.)</p><p>(b)  
Tours of duty of 24 hours or more
but less than 48 hours.</p><p>FOH
31b12 and IB 785.22 describe excludable sleep time for hours of duty of 24
hours or more. On continuous tours of duty of more than 24 hours but less than
48 hours, one extra hour of sleep time in excess of the maximum 8 hours may be
claimed for each hour beyond 40 that a continuous tour of duty extends,
provided that the employee has actually slept such number of hours. For
example, in a 42-hour continuous tour of duty, no more than 10 hours could be
deducted for sleep time. Similarly, in a 45-hour continuous tour, a maximum of
13 hours could be deducted. However, in the absence of an express or implied
agreement concerning the exclusion of sleep time, the time spent sleeping
constitutes hours worked even though the tour of duty exceeds 24 hours. See
also 31b12.</p><p>(c)  
Continuous tours of duty.</p><p>(1)  As indicated in IB 785.12 through 785.16, waiting or
layover time will be considered off-duty time and not part of the employee’s
hours of work if the employee is completely relieved of all duties and
responsibilities, is permitted to leave the truck or temporary station to go
anywhere, knows in advance that work will not resume until a specified time,
and the period of layover is of sufficient length to be used effectively for
the employee’s own purposes. Thus, no standard rule of thumb, such as “2-hour
layover time” or “4-hour layover time” can be used to unequivocally state that
a layover period of such length has automatically broken a continuous tour of
duty. Whether or not a continuous tour of duty greater than 24 hours is
interrupted by a waiting or layover time is a question of fact. For example, if
a truck driver stops for a layover of 2 hours, but the stopping point happens
to be in a remote location which has no available facilities (restaurants,
etc.), the tour of duty has not been interrupted and the “off-duty” time is
compensable hours worked.</p><p>(2)  With regard to team truck drivers, because of the
special circumstances under which they work, we would not regard a bona fide
layover period as breaking a continuous tour of duty if the employer paid wages
for that period.</p><p>(3)  Time spent in noncompensable bona fide meal periods
and bona fide regularly scheduled sleeping periods would not break a continuous
tour of duty provided that such periods do not exceed the maximum limitations
in 785.22 and the “40-hour rule” set forth in (b) above. (See also 31b12.)</p>

              <p>In
some instances an employee of a newspaper or radio or television station will
read a particular book with the view to a possible book review story for use in
the newspaper or on the air. This presents no problem as to hours worked where
the reading is done in the course of the employee’s regular duties at the establishment
or elsewhere at any time at the employer’s specific request. However, the
reading may be done away from the employer’s establishment and outside duty
hours, such as at the employee’s home in the evening, and on a speculative
basis - that is, with the thought that a book review might be prepared. In such
cases there is a substantial question as to whether the reading was done for
the benefit of the employer or for the pleasure or information of the employee.
In such cases, WH will not assert that such reading is hours worked even though
the book is subsequently reviewed in the newspaper or on the air.</p>

Where there is a “reasonable

R/K regarding hours worked is not required. The employer may keep a time record

The “reasonable agreement” must be
an employer-employee agreement and not a unilateral decision by the employer.
Such an agreement should normally be in writing in order to preclude any
possible misunderstanding of the terms and conditions of an individual’s
employment. It must take into account not only the time spent working but also
the time when the employee may engage in normal private pursuits, with sufficient
time for eating, sleeping, entertaining, and other periods of complete freedom
from all duties when he or she may leave the premises for personal reasons. The
agreement must also consider such relevant factors as the degree to which the
use of the employee’s personal time is limited or restricted by the conditions
of employment and the extent of interruption to eating and sleeping periods.
However, whether an employee is free to use time for personal pursuits will
depend on the facts in each case, notwithstanding the provisions of any written

Ordinarily, an employee residing

qualify as residing on the premises “for extended periods of time.” For
example, employees who are on duty from 9 a.m. Monday until 5 p.m. Friday would
also be considered to reside on the employer’s premises. Even though on duty
for less than 120 hours, they are on duty for five consecutive days (Monday
through Friday). The fact that they sleep over only four nights does not alter
this conclusion. Similarly, employees who are on duty from 9 p.m. Monday until

Reg 553.222(c), where an employer and employee had agreed that time spent

then consider the employee’s continued employment to be acceptance of such
change. Some form of uncoerced mutual assent is necessary to consider the
parties’ agreement validly changed.</p><p>Reg
553.222(c) does not address the converse, i.e., the procedure for making sleep
time compensable where there was previously an expressed or implied agreement
to exclude such time from compensable hours of work. Consequently, an employee
could unilaterally withdraw his/her consent and the employer would then be
required to compensate the employee for any future sleep time that may occur.
However, the employer would not be required to agree to a continuation of the
same terms and conditions of employment. The employer and employee would be
free to establish new conditions of employment, such as rate of pay, hours of

but has merely hired the use of the team or truck for the daily working period
at the job site, beginning after the delivery there of the harnessed team or
the truck by the owner and ending when the owner leaves with his team or truck,
the employer obviously has no responsibility for the team or truck outside this
period, and cannot direct what is to be done in the way of caring for it, or
how, where, or by whom it shall be readied for work. In such an event, the care
and transportation of the team or truck would be engaged in by the owner and
not as an employee of the employer Under these circumstances, time spent in those
activities outside the employee’s workday at the job site would not be hours

Travel time spent in carrying

and his work site, involving no appreciable burden or inconvenience, is not
hours worked. In determinations of this kind, some consideration must be given

clearly is that the pay or the time of the employee begins and ends at the

company vehicles between home and work sites.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Background:</p><p>(1)  In some industries employers utilize somewhat modified
vans or trucks for use by employees who perform service work at a customer’s
home or business establishment. The vehicle provides a necessary means for the
employee to transport needed parts, tools, equipment, etc., to various work
sites during the day. The employer may give employees the opportunity to drive
the vehicle between home and work on a voluntary basis.</p><p>(2)  In some instances, the employee starts the work day by
calling the employer’s dispatcher from home, receiving one or more work
assignments to begin the work day, and traveling directly from home to the
first work site rather than traveling first to the employer’s establishment and
then to the work site. At the end of the day the employee may be required to
call the employer’s dispatcher to advise that the last service call for the day
has been completed and that the employee is leaving the last work site for
home, where the employee parks and locks the vehicle. During this call to the
dispatcher, the employee may or may not receive assignments for the next day.</p><p>(3)  WH policy on the compensability of travel time in such
situations was set forth in an Administrator’s opinion letter dated August 5, 1994.
In light of the concerns expressed by both employers and employees, and the
possible effects of applying this interpretation in a wide variety of
industries, the Secretary of Labor, on October 19, 1994, deferred any WH
efforts to enforce the policy in that opinion letter while a review was
undertaken.</p><p>(b)  
Policy:</p><p>An
Administrator’s opinion letter was issued on April 3, 1995, which withdrew the
August 5, 1994, opinion letter and set forth WH’s position in this matter.
Accordingly, where the following circumstances exist, time spent traveling
between the employee’s home and the first work site of the day and between the
last work site of the day and the employee’s home need not be compensated:</p><p>(1)  driving the employer’s vehicle between the employee’s
home and customers’ work sites at the beginning and end of the workday is
strictly voluntary and not a condition of employment;</p><p>(2)  the vehicle involved is the type of vehicle that would
normally be used for commuting;</p><p>(3)  the employee incurs no costs for driving the employer’s
vehicle or parking it at the employee’s home or elsewhere; and</p><p>(4)  the work sites are within the normal commuting area of
the employer’s establishment.</p>

              <h3>31d00. Ambulance services.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Numerous hours worked questions
may arise with respect to employees engaged in ambulance services. The most
common are as follows:</p><p>(1)  Less than 24 hours duty. Ambulance employees who are
required to be on duty at their employer’s place of business for periods of
less than 24 hours are working even though they are permitted to sleep or
engage in other personal activities when not busy. (See IB 785.21.) However,
the usual rules with respect to meal periods would apply when they are relieved
of all duties for the purpose of eating meals.</p><p>(2)  Duty of 24 hours or more. (See IB 785.22.) Some
ambulance employees may be required by the employer to be on duty on his
premises for 24 hours or more. The parties may agree to exclude bona fide meal
periods and a regularly scheduled sleeping period of not more than 8 hours,
provided the employer furnishes adequate sleeping facilities and the employee
can usually enjoy uninterrupted sleep during the period. If the sleeping period
is more than 8 hours, only 8 hours may be excluded from hours worked. Any
interruption of the sleeping period to respond to calls must be counted as
hours worked. If the period is interrupted to such an extent that the employee
cannot get a reasonable “night’s sleep”, the entire sleeping period must be
counted as hours worked. For enforcement purposes, the “night’s sleep” will be
considered reasonable if the employee can get at least 5 hours sleep during the
period. Thus, where these tests are met, the actual sleeping time (i.e., not
less than 5 hours and not more than 8 hours) may be excluded from hours worked.
Off-duty periods during which the employee has complete freedom from duties and
may leave the premises for his own purposes may also be excluded.</p><p>(3)  Employees who reside on the employer’s premises
permanently or for extended periods of time. Some ambulance service employees
reside on their employer’s premises. In such cases, the employee is not working
all the time he is on the premises. In determining hours worked, bona fide
off-duty time need not be counted and any reasonable agreement of the parties
which takes into consideration all the pertinent facts will be accepted. (See
IB 785.23.) In the absence of an agreement, the Inv should make a reasonable
determination giving recognition to the facts in the particular case which
indicate the amount of time that the employee does have to eat, sleep, and
devote to his own pursuits.</p><p>(4)  On-call time. Except where the employee is on duty 24
hours or more or resides on the premises, time spent by an employee in an
“on-call” status at his employer’s establishment is hours worked. On the other
hand, where an employee is not required to remain on his employer’s premises
but is free to engage in his own pursuits and merely required to leave word
where he may be reached, the time so spent is not considered to be hours
worked. See IB 785.17.) If the employee does in fact go out on a call, the time
actually spent in making the call including travel time is hours worked. Also,
there may be situations when calls are so frequent or the “on-call” conditions
so restrictive that the employee is not really free to use the intervening
periods for his own benefit. In such cases he may be considered as “engaged to
wait” rather than “waiting to be engaged” and the waiting time would also be
counted as hours worked.</p><p>(5)  Employee who takes ambulance to his home. In the
ordinary case where an employer permits an employee to drive an ambulance to
and from his home for the employee’s own convenience, the time so spent in
driving is not hours worked (see FOH 31c01). If the employee is required to
take the ambulance home in order to be able to respond to calls immediately,
all the time spent in driving would be hours worked. The time the ambulance
remains parked idly outside the employee’s residence, and the employee is free
to engage in his own pursuits subject only to the understanding that he leave
word at his home or with company officials where he may be reached, would not
be regarded as hours worked under the Act. The waiting time would be counted as
hours worked only in situations of the type referred to in the last two
sentences of paragraph (4). If the ambulance is parked at the employee’s home,
the employee would be considered working from the time he sets out on a call
until the time he returns to his home.</p>

need of custodial care.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Employees of these group homes may
have regularly scheduled off-duty periods during the day (for which they are
not paid) which might ordinarily break a continuous tour of duty of 24 hours or
more. Therefore, a question arises as to whether their sleep time can be
deducted from working time.</p><p>(b)  
Full-time houseparents.</p><p>The
facilities in question employ houseparents, as well as relief staff in many
cases, to provide custodial care for individuals who reside at the facilities.
The houseparents sleep overnight, sometimes as many as 5 or 6 days in a row,
after which they get a day or 2 off. In addition, the houseparents may also
have several hours off each afternoon, when they are free to do whatever they
choose, including leaving the premises. They sleep in private quarters separate
from the residents of the group home. Many of these houseparents maintain
permanent residences elsewhere in the community, but others have as their only
residence the facility for the mentally retarded. Where such full-time house
parents meet the standards set forth in FOH 31b20, they are considered to be
residing on the premises in accordance with IB 785.23. Therefore, the sleeptime
rules in IB 785.22 and .23 will be applied.</p><p>(c)  
Relief employees.</p><p>(1)  The relief staff may stay overnight at a facility for
one or more nights a week. During a 24-hour period, these employees may also
have regularly scheduled off-duty time during the day with complete freedom
from all responsibilities. They, too, sleep in private quarters separate from
the residents of the group home.</p><p>(2)  In situations where a community residence employs at
least one employee who resides on the employer’s premises “for extended periods
of time” (see FOH 31b20 and IB 785.23), the employer and a relief employee who
performs essentially the same duties as such full-time employee may enter into
a “reasonable agreement” (see FOH 31(b)(18)(b)) to hours worked. Such an
agreement, entered into in advance of the performance of any work, may provide
that sleeping time of up to 8 hours can be excluded from compensable hours of
work, regardless of the length of the tour of duty involved. Also, a mutually
agreed-upon amount of off-duty time, during which the employee is completely
free from all responsibilities, can be excluded from compensable hours of work.
Since the residents of such facilities are usually on the premises all day on
weekends, the hours worked by weekend relief employees may be significantly
longer than the hours worked by the employees who work weekdays. Agreements
with weekend employees must reflect such differences.</p>
