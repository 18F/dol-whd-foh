            <h3>12a00 - Statutory definition and IB.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
FLSA Sec 3(r) defines the
“enterprise” which is the business unit tested for coverage under Sec 3(s). IB
779.200 through 779.235 contains the official Wage-Hour interpretations
regarding the principles which determine the activities which are included
within an enterprise for purposes of the Act.</p><p>(b)          
Effective 7/1/72, the Education
Amendments of 1972 amended Sec 3(r)(1) to include preschools within the
coverage of the Act. Sec (r)(1) as amended reads as follows: </p><p>“(1) in connection with the operation of a hospital, an institution
primarily engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, the mentally ill or
defective who reside on the premises of such institution a. school for mentally
or physically handicapped or gifted children, a preschool, elementary or secondary
school, or an institution of higher education (regardless of whether or not
such hospital, institution or school is public or private or operated for
profit or not for profit), or”</p><p>(c)           
Effective 5/1/74, the 1974
Amendments amended Sec 3(r) to include all public agencies within coverage of
the Act. Sec 3(r)(3) of the amended Act reads as follows: </p><p>“(3)           in connection with the activities of a public agency”.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="12a01"></div>
            <h3>12a01  - Common ownership.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Sec 3(r) does not require unified
operation if there is common control. Further, common ownership may in certain
situations be sufficient to establish the common control required by the Act
(see IB 779.215 and 779.222). It does not necessarily follow, however, that the
activities which are thus commonly controlled are related and performed through
such common control for a common business purpose so as to bring them all
within a single enterprise. A determination as to whether or not these tests
are met requires that the total situation be considered and that each of the tests
be viewed realistically in the context of the others rather than solely in
isolation.</p><p>(b)          
While the facts in each case will
be determinative of whether the tests of Sec 3(r) are met, the following
excerpts from recent opinions will serve to illustrate the application of the
principles set out in (a) above in situations where common ownership was a
factor to be considered.</p><p>(1)  A parent corporation, characterized as a holding
company or finance and investment group, owns and controls numerous subsidiary
corporations. The latter are engaged, respectively, in such diversified
activities as retail hardware, animal feed manufacture, building management,
mortgage loans, steel container manufacture, and so on. The opinion stated: “A
holding corporation may be organized and operated for investment purposes and
the facts may show in a particular case that the activities of its operating
subsidiaries are not actually related activities performed through common
control for a common business purpose but are separately performed for
different corporate purposes contained in the separate corporate charters. A
different situation would be presented, of course, if it appeared that the
holding company, under authority of its charter, was in fact performing with
its subsidiaries through common control a combination of related activities in
which the various corporations are engaged, and that such activities were all
related to, and performed for, a unitary business purpose for which the holding
company was formed and which is common to all such activities”.</p><p>(2)  Two brothers live, respectively, in cities A and B.
They have for several years owned a retail grocery supermarket, as equal
partners. This supermarket is operated by a manager who is in active charge of
the store. One of the brothers individually purchased an operating grocery
store in another town. This store is operated by a full-time manager who makes
daily reports to the owner brother. He makes no reports to the other brother.
The operation of the two stores is not unified in any way. An issue was raised
as to whether the activities of the two stores are related activities performed
for a common business purpose. The opinion stated: “The activities in question
are related in kind, since they are those of retail stores. The question
remains, however, as to whether they are, within the meaning of Sec 3(r),
related activities performed through common control for a common business
purpose. It is true, as stated in IB 779.212, that the term “common business
purpose” as used in Sec 3(r) does not have a narrow concept and is not intended
to be limited to a single business establishment or a single type of business.
But where, as here, there are related activities having no functional
interdependence and they are separately conducted to serve the business purpose
of the partnership on the one hand and the business purpose of one brother
individually on the other, we are not prepared to say that the requirement of
performance ‘through common control’ of ‘related activities’ for a ‘common business
purpose’ is sufficiently met”.</p>

            <h3>12a02 - Country and town clubs.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Country and town clubs, even
though nonprofit organizations, which are organized and operated exclusively by
and for the pleasure and recreational purposes of a select group of persons
specially selected for membership (or their guests), are considered to be
operated for a “business purpose” within the meaning of Sec 3(r). There is no
exclusion in the Act for pleasure or recreational clubs and the activities of
such clubs do not fall within the “nonprofit educational, religious and
eleemosynary” activities set forth in IR 779.214. The fact that a membership
organization is formed for the purpose of providing facilities or services to
its members only does not remove it from the sphere of business. (See IB
779.317 and FOH 25j06.)</p><p>(b)          
Included in the ADV of such a club
enterprise are initiation fees which are paid only once; direct charges for use
of club facilities which includes charges for food and beverage; athletic or
sporting rental fees; lodging and valet charges; membership dues and
assessments paid as a condition of continued membership; fees paid by members
to club professionals for lessons (whether or not accounted for to the club.)</p>

            <h3>12a03 - Fraternal orders.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Like social or recreational clubs,
the activities of a national fraternal order and its local lodges usually do
not fall within the nonprofit educational, religious, or charitable activities
set forth in IB 779.214. Generally, such orders are considered to be operated for
a “business purpose” within the meaning of Sec 3(r). The ADV of a fraternal
order includes gross receipts from membership fees and any insurance business
or other commercial-type ventures since such sums are generated for a “business
purpose”.</p><p>(b)          
However, for purposes of
determining enterprise coverage, a national fraternal order and its local
lodges constitute a single enterprise under the Act only if the activities are
performed through unified operations or common control for a common business
purpose. Where a local lodge operates as a service and/or social club and the
national order has little or no control over its day-to-day operations and also
has no interaction with the local lodge regarding activities such as insurance
programs or other business ventures, there would be no single enterprise. In
such cases, each lodge must be tested separately for purposes of determining
enterprise coverage</p>

            <h3>12a04 - Golf facilities at country clubs operated by professionals.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Where the golf facilities operated
by a professional at a country club are held out as a place where goods and
services can be obtained to meet more completely and conveniently the needs and
desires of the club’s members it expects to service, It would be unrealistic to
regard the activities of such facilities as functionally separated from those
of the country club as a whole, for purposes of enterprise coverage. Rather,
the relationship of the business activities in providing goods and services to
the club’s members is functionally close and immediately connected with a
single business purpose common to the golf facilities and the country club. The
Act’s definition of “enterprise” contemplates that the activities of “one or
more corporate or other organizational units” may be joined in a single enterprise
meeting the statutory tests. The effect of the agreement between the country
club and the golf professional is to bring about the performance through
unified operations of the activities described so that they serve a common
business purpose, thus reflecting a situation much like that of companies
operating leased departments in stores, which clearly are contemplated by the
Act as included in the store enterprise. Therefore, Wage-Hour would consider
that the activities so joined form a single enterprise as defined in Sec 3(r)
of the Act. (See also FOH 12a02(b).)</p><p>(b)          
These golf professionals are not
considered independent contractors of the kind referred to in Sec 3(r) as
performing related activities for the enterprise, as distinguished from these
performing such activities as participants in the enterprise. The term
“independent contractor” as used in Sec 3(r) for the purpose of exclusion from
the term “enterprise” has reference to an independent business which performs
services for other businesses as an established part of its own business
operations, and which deals in the ordinary course of its own operations with
the enterprise for which it performs services. The exclusion does not extend to
the performance of any related activities which, in economic reality, are
integral parts of the operation of the enterprise and actually performed
through unified operation or under common control with its other related
activities for its common business purpose. Not only are such activities not
excluded from the enterprise, but the employees of the golf professional would
be covered under enterprise coverage to the same extent as other employees of
the country club.</p>

            <p>(a)           
IB 779.226 - 778.232 discuss
franchise agreements. The following agreement, involving an employment agency,
is a further example of a situation where a single enterprise was found to
exist:</p><p>(1)  the agreement includes an announcement of the
intention to form a national chain of such businesses as are conducted by the
franchisor and by means of the same trade name, forms, training manuals and
distinguishing characteristics (as established by the franchisor) to present a
united front and to secure public good will and encourage the use of the
franchisor’s service on a national basis;</p><p>(2)  the franchisee is bound to observe strictly the rules
of operation established by the franchisor (who is free to change them at
anytime) and to file quarterly a statement of operation and whatever other
reports the franchisor may require;</p><p>(3)  the franchisor prescribes, by means of a uniform form,
the contract which the franchisee shall make with his employees and his clients
and the fee to be charged the latter. Advertising presents the franchisor and
franchisee as one to the public. Franchisee is barred by the a franchise
agreement from entering into the same business for himself or with other firms
providing the service for three years and his employees for six months after
their service ends;</p><p>(4)  in addition to the fee paid for the franchise, a uniform
percentage of gross receipts is remitted monthly to the franchisor who has
access at all times to the books, papers, and records;</p><p>(5)  the franchisor has power to enforce the arrangements
for its participation and supervision through its right to terminate the
franchise if any term of agreement is violated. In the event of a sale of the
controlling interest, the franchisor receives a percentage of the sale price to
defray costs in training and assistance for the new management;</p><p>(6)  all job orders with a starting salary of $500 or more
per month must be sent by the franchisee to the franchisor who processes them
and distributes them to all franchise offices. If another office succeeds in
placing an applicant in the job the fee is split 50-50 between the two franchisee
offices;</p><p>(7)  the franchisor furnishes roving managers and trouble
shooters where needed. </p>

            <h3>12a06 - Banking
enterprises.</h3>
            <p>(a)   In most cases, an enterprise engaged in banking is
limited by law to activities which are related to banking and to purposes of a
bank. This does not mean, however, that the only activities within a banking
enterprise are those which constitute banking in its most narrow sense.
Included in the enterprise of a bank, for example, where conducted under
unified operation or common control for a common business purpose, would be
those real estate operations incidental to a bank’s lending money and providing
housing for the conduct of its business. Thus, the operation of the bank
building or other buildings acquired as an incident to its banking operation,
even though such buildings are occupied by tenants other than the bank, would
be within the banking enterprise. The operation by the bank itself or a
subsidiary corporation of a parking lot or garage in conjunction with such a
building for the purpose of providing parking accommodations for customers of
the bank and the building tenants would likewise be included.  (See IB
779.206(b).)</p>

            <h3>12b00 - Statutory
provisions.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Sec 3(s) of the Act as amended in
1974 defines the term “enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of
goods for commerce” as “an enterprise which has employees engaged in commerce
or in the production of goods for commerce, or employees handling, selling, or
otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for
commerce by any person . . . .“ The Act further specifies that: “Any
establishment which has as its only regular employees the owner thereof or the
parent, spouse, child or other member of the immediate family of such owner
shall not be considered to be an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the
production of goods for commerce or a part of such an enterprise, and the sales
of such establishment shall not be included for the purpose of determining the
annual gross volume of sales of any enterprise for the purpose of this
subsection.”</p><p>(b)          
Pending issuance of a revised
coverage bulletin, Secs 779.240 through 779.243 continues as valid
interpretations of the phrase in Sec 3(s): “or employees handling, selling, or
otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for
commerce by any person....”  The reference in Sec 3(s) as amended in 1974 to
enterprises having “employees engaged in commerce or in the production of goods
for commerce”, as in the case of the prior reference in the Act as amended in
1961 to enterprises in the activities of which “employees are so engaged”,
simply means that the employment of employees individually covered in the
traditional sense will also constitute a basis for determining that the
enterprise itself is engaged in “commerce or the production of goods for
commerce”. The usual tests for such individual coverage apply.</p><p>(c)           
The language of Sec 3(s) of the
1966 Amendments--”. . . including employees handling, selling, or otherwise
working on goods . . .“--was changed in the 1974 Amendments to “. . . or
employees handling, selling or otherwise working on goods or materials ... .“
By changing the word “including” to “or”, Congress indicated its intention to
reflect more clearly that this is an additional basis of coverage. The 1974
Amendments also added the words “or materials” to make clear the Congressional
intent to include within this additional basis of coverage the handling of
goods consumed in the employer’s business, e.g., the soap used by a laundry.</p><p>(d)          
 </p><p>(1)  The 1977 amendments established a new Sec 3(s)(2) for
coverage of enterprises comprised exclusively of one or more retail or service
establishments and whose AGV of sales or business done (exclusive of the usual
excise taxes) is not less than:</p><p>$275,000 effective 7/1/78</p><p>$325,000 effective 7/1/80</p><p>$362,500 effective 1/1/82</p><p>(2)  Sec 3(s) was further amended in 1977 to require that
those retail or service enterprises which were subject to Sec 6(a)(1) on June
30. 1978, and which were removed from coverage under Sec 3(s)(2) because the
AGV is less than the sales volume tests, must (if the AGV does not fall below
$250,00) pay its employees not less than the MW in effect on the day before
coverage was lost. Such newly uncovered retail or service enterprises are
required to pay OT.</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="12b01"></div>
            <h3>12b01 - Enterprise
employee test.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
In order for all employees of an
enterprise to be covered on an enterprise basis under amended Sec 3(s), at
least some of the employees employed in the activities which constitute the
enterprise must be engaged in commerce or in producing goods for commerce, or
handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been
moved in or produced for commerce by any person. Thus, where the enterprise has
some employees so engaged, it is not necessary that two or more employees in
each establishment be individually covered. The requirement is that the
enterprise have some employees who are individually covered or engaged in
handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been
moved in or produced for commerce by any person. Although two or more employees
so engaged may be sufficient to satisfy this requirement, it is important to
establish, if possible, that the number of such employees is substantial or
that it represents a significant portion of the employees in the enterprise.</p><p>(b)          
It is not necessary that the enterprise
have two or more employees engaged in the named activities every week since
this test as with other requirements for enterprise coverage under Sec 3(s) is
applied on an annual basis. Thus, this requirement will be met if such
employees are engaged in the named activities on a regular and recurrent basis.
The requirement will not be met, however, where the enterprise has employees
engaged only in an insubstantial amount of the named activities on isolated or
sporadic occasions.</p><p>(c)           
It is not necessary that the
employees engaged in the activities described in Sec 3(s) be nonexempt. Thus,
for example, the test will be met where one or more of the employees is exempt
from Sec 6 or 7 so long as they are engaged in the named activities. Likewise,
so long as the enterprise “has” such employees employed in its activities, it
is not necessary that such employees perform their duties in an establishment
of the enterprise.</p>

            <h3>12b02 - Application of
amended Sec 3(s) to mixed or hybrid enterprises.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
A single enterprise within the
meaning of Sec 3(r) may in some cases be engaged in various activities which,
although related and for a common business purpose, so differ in character and
function as to constitute a mixed or hybrid enterprise and thus involve the
possible application of more than one of the tests under Sec 3(s). For example,
a manufacturing enterprise may also engage in construction. In such situations,
the application of the test of Sec 3(s) shall be made as follows:</p><p>(1)  If the hybrid enterprise consists only of a
combination of activities which are named in Secs 3(s)(3) through (5) as
activities of the enterprise therein described (with respect to which there is
no ADV test), all employees employed in the hybrid enterprise shall be considered
covered on an enterprise basis under Sec 3(s).</p><p>(2)  If the hybrid enterprise consists of some combination
of activities named as those in which enterprises covered under Secs 3(s)(3)
through (5) are engaged, together with other activities not so named, the employees
employed in the hybrid enterprise shall be considered covered on an enterprise
basis under Sec 3(s), if the ADV test of Sec 3(s)(1) is met by the hybrid
enterprise.</p><p>(3)  In the case of any hybrid enterprise consisting of a
combination of activities named as those in which enterprises covered under
Secs 3(s)(3) through 3(s)(5) are engaged, together with other activities not so
named, whose ADV is less then $250,000 exclusive of the specified taxes, the
facts shall be developed and the matter submitted to the RS for opinion with
respect to coverage of the employees employed in the enterprise in activities
not named in Secs 3(s)(3) through 3(s)(5) as activities of the enterprises
covered thereby. In any such case, however, enterprise coverage extends at least
to those employees employed in the hybrid enterprise in activities named in
Secs 3(s)(3) through (5) as activities of the enterprises therein described</p>

            <h3>12b03 - Goods or materials
under Sec 3(s).</h3>
            <p>Employees will be considered to be handling, selling or otherwise
working on “goods or materials” that have been moved in or produced for
commerce by any person within the meaning of Sec 3(s), if what they are
handling, selling, or working on constitutes “goods or materials” which have
been so moved or produced. “Goods” are defined in Sec 3(i) of the Act. The fact
that the interstate movement of the goods or materials handled or worked on by
the employees does not begin until after, or has ended before, their work is
performed can provide no basis for concluding that their activities do not
relate to “goods or materials” within the meaning of Sec 3(s). Congress has
specifically recognized that demand for a product affects interstate inflow of
“goods or materials” quite as surely as production for commerce affects
outflow. Thus the language “goods or materials”, as used in Sec 3(s), includes
trucks, equipment, replacement parts, supplies, stock-in-trade, finished or raw
materials and other “goods or materials” that have been moved in or produced
for commerce.</p>

(See IB 779.261 thru IB 779.264.)
The extent to which State excise taxes on tobacco are levied at the retail
level depends upon the law of the particular State. In cases where enterprise
coverage hinges on the question of State excise taxes on tobacco, all the facts
regarding such taxes shall be submitted through channels to the RS for an
opinion.</p><p>(b)          
The price of auto license plates
does not represent a separately stated tax imposed at the retail level for the
use of highways. Thus, no part of the sale price of auto license plates can
qualify as excise taxes levied “at the retail level”.</p>

purposes of Sec 3(s) AGV test.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
The definition of a “sale” in Sec
3(k) and the discussion in IB 779.259 of income which is included in the AGV of
sales for purposes of Secs 3(s)(1) and 3(s)(2) will in most cases provide
sufficient guidance to determine whether the AGV tests of Sec 3(s) are met. In
some cases, however, it may not be possible to determine on the basis of
current interpretative material whether certain income or transactions are
considered as “sales” (or “business”) for purposes of Sec 3(s). In such cases,
and where enterprise coverage hinges on the question, all the facts regarding
such income and transactions shall be submitted through channels to the RS for
an opinion.</p><p>(b)          
The interpretations set forth
below are specific determinations regarding certain “sales” (or “business”) of
particular establishments and industries. When referring to these
determinations it must be kept in mind that the listings do not include all
“sales” of the named establishments and industries.</p><p>(1)  Insurance companies.  </p><p>The total premium income received from all policies in a given year
constitute “sales” and are included in that year’s AGV of sales without regard
to the year in which the policy was originally sold.</p><p>(2)  Banks and financial institutions.</p><p>Interest from loans and stock dividends are included in the AGV of
sales.</p><p>(3)  Automobile license bureaus or tag agencies.</p><p>The gross price of auto license plates sold by privately operated auto
tag agencies or license bureaus is included in the ADV. (See also FOH 12b04(b)
and FOH 21ca07.)</p><p>(4)  Real estate. financial, and property management firms.</p><p>The total rental receipts received by real estate, financial, and
property management firms from buildings which they own are included in the AGV
of sales for purposes of Sec 3(s)(1). With respect to properties which such
firms manage but do not own, only the gross fee or gross commission received
for services rendered would be included in the AGV of sales. In connection with
other related activities, such as the sale of property and property insurance,
the annual sales volume is measured by gross receipts and not by commission
payments.</p>

by United States, State, or local governments will be excluded in computing the

            <h3>12c02 - “Business done”
defined.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
The 1966 Amendments added the
phrase “or business done” to the term “annual gross volume of sales made” in
Sec 3(s)(1) to reflect more clearly the economic test of business size
previously expressed in the Act in terms of “annual gross volume of sales”. It
is intended by this test to measure the size of an enterprise for purposes of
enterprise coverage in terms of the ADV in dollars (exclusive of specified
taxes) of the business transactions of the enterprise, regardless of whether such
transactions are “sales” in a technical sense. Based on language contained in
the Congressional Reports, the measure is intended to be applied to business
transactions with the customers of the enterprise, or with the persons who
purchase property or services of any kind through transactions with the
enterprise, in terms of the gross price they pay for whatever they obtain as a
result of the transaction; no intent appears to measure “business done” by
adding to such amounts the sums paid out by the enterprise as business
expenses. For example, gross dollar volume from “business done” will include
the gross amounts paid by the tenants or users as consideration for the leasing
or rental of property to them by the enterprise. On the other hand,
expenditures made by the enterprise such as rental payments, mortgage payments,
interest payments on loans, and accounts payable will be excluded in computing
gross volume of sales made and business done.</p><p>(b)          
In applying Sec 3(s)(1), the ADV
of an enterprise is deemed to include the gross volume of the “sales” which it
makes, as defined in Sec 3(k) of the Act (see IB 779.259), and/or the gross
volume of its “business done” as explained in (a) above; that is, the gross
dollar volume of any other business activity in which the enterprise engaged
which can similarly be measured on a dollar basis.</p>

The 1977 Amendments amended Sec
3(s) effective January 1, 1978, to include a new Sec 3(s)(2). Sec 3(s)(1) was
amended by adding the following after “and begin February 1, 1969, is an
enterprise”:</p><p>“, other than an enterprise which is comprised exclusively of retail or
service establishments and which is described in paragraph (2),”.</p><p>Sec 3(s)(2) now reads:</p><p>“is an enterprise which is comprised exclusively of one or more retail
or service establishments, as defined in section 13(a)(2), and whose annual
gross volume of sales made or business done is not less that $250,000
(exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level which are separately stated),
beginning July 1, 1978, whose annual gross volume of sales made or business
done is not less than $275,000 (exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level
which are separately stated), beginning July 1, 1980, whose annual gross volume
of sales made or business done is not less than $325,000 (exclusive of excise

Sec 3(s) was further amended by
adding the following “grandfather clause” to the end of the section.</p><p>“Notwithstanding paragraph (2), an enterprise which is comprised of one
or more retail or service establishments, which on June 30, 1978, was subject
to section 6(a)(1), and which because of a change in the dollar volume standard
in such paragraph prescribed by the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1977 is
not subject to such section, shall, if its annual gross volume of sales made or
business done is not less than $250,000 (exclusive of excise taxes at the
retail level which are separately stated), pay its employees not less than the
minimum wage in effect under such section on the day before such change takes
effect and shall pay its employees in accordance with section 7.  A violation
of the preceding sentence shall be considered a violation of section 6 or 7 as
the case may be.”</p><p>(c)           
The Amendments of 1977 made a
number of changes in the FLSA which concern enterprises comprised exclusively
of one or more retail or service establishments. These amendments:</p><p>(1)  Changed the ADV test for coverage under new Sec
3(s)(2);</p><p>(2)  Increased the MW;</p><p>(3)  Increased the monthly dollar test for tipped employees
under Sec 3(t); and</p><p>(4)  Decreased the tip credit under Sec 3(m) of the Act.</p><div>

Enterprises not 3(s)(2) covered on
6/30/78:</p><p>(Some effects of changes in the ADV under Sec 3(s)(2) on coverage of
retail or service enterprises are illustrated below. See also FOH 21a01.)</p><p>(1)  A new retail or service enterprise beginning business
after 6/30/78 is not covered until its ADV reaches the applicable statutory
amount contained in Sec 3(s)(2) ($362,500 effective 1/1/82).</p><p>(2)  If such an enterprise had an ADV of less than $250,000
on 6/30/78, it was not a covered Sec 3(s)(2) enterprise. This lack of coverage
under Sec 3(s)(2) continues if the enterprise never attains an ADV which would
cover it under Sec 3(s)(2) ($362,500 since 1/1/82).</p><p>(3)  However, if such an enterprise’s ADV increases so that
it equals or exceeds the $362,500 ADV test currently in effect, the enterprise
must begin paying MW and OT at the time coverage becomes applicable.</p><p>(4)  If the ADV later falls below $362,500, the enterprise
would not be covered and would remain so until the ADV again increases to the
$362,500 level at which time the enterprise would again be covered under Sec
3(s)(2)</p><p>(b)          
Enterprises 3(s)(2) covered on
6/30/78:</p><p>Some effects of changes in the ADV of a Sec 3(s)(2) enterprise which is
“grandfathered” under Sec 3(s) are illustrated below:</p><p>(1)  Enterprise coverage under the grandfather clause at
the end of Sec 3(s) cannot be asserted unless the enterprise was covered on
6/30/78. The language of Sec 3(s) expressly requires that in order to be
grandfathered an enterprise must have been covered on 6/30/78.</p><p>(2)  By way of illustration, if, during the period 7/1/78
to 6/30/80, a retail enterprise had an ADV of at least $275,000, and its ADV
subsequently falls below $275,000 (but remains at least $250,000), the MW
effective for that enterprise reverts to $2.65 an hour (the MW in effect on the
day before the statutory ADV increased to $275,000). This MW remains in effect
for the enterprise until its ADV falls below $250,000, or until its ADV once
again reaches a statutory ADV level which requires payment of a higher MW. This
is illustrated below:</p><div>

</div><p>(3)  To further illustrate, if the ADV of a retail or
service enterprise (which was covered on 6/30/78) was $300,000 on 7/1/80, and
the enterprise became noncovered because of the increase in the statutory
standard on that date ($325,000), it would be required to continue to pay an MW
of 3.10 per hour until such time as the ADV of the enterprise met a later
statutory level ($325,000 from 7/1/80 to 12/31/81; $362,500 after 12/31/81). At
such time as the ADV of the enterprise reached the later statutory level, it would
be required to pay the MW in effect at that time ($3.35 per hour since
12/31/80).</p><p>Once its ADV has risen to a later statutory level, the enterprise would
be required to continue to pay the applicable MW until such time as its ADV
falls below that level. Thereafter, it would be required to pay (1) whatever MW
was applicable “on the day before the statutory change took effect,” and (2)
proper OT. For example, if an enterprise having an ADV of $362,500 fell to an
ADV of $300,000, its applicable MW would become $3.10 an hour, which was the
statutory MW in effect on 6/30/80, the day before the statutory ADV level rose
to $325,000.</p><p>If on the other hand, the ADV of the enterprise falls below $250,000,
it would cease to be covered until such time as its ADV rose to at least the
current level of $362,500.</p><p>(c)           
Certain special problems which
have arisen from the application of the grandfather clause are as follows:</p><p>(1)  A hotel or motel enterprise which is grandfathered
under Sec 3(s)(2) cannot pay OT based on the old partial OT exemption formerly
contained in Sec 13(b)(8) notwithstanding the fact that Sec 13(b)(8) was in
effect at the time the enterprise was grandfathered. Sec 3(s) states that a
retail or service enterprise which is grandfathered shall pay its employees in
accordance with Sec 7. There is no implication that any exemptions which were
repealed are to apply currently to grandfathered enterprises because the
exemption may have been applicable on 6/30/78, or thereafter.</p><p>(2)  Retail or service enterprises which are grandfathered
under Sec 3(s)(2) cannot take a tip credit higher than that currently in effect
(40%).  </p><p>There is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that the higher
tip credits which were available to employers prior to 1/1/79 or 1/1/80 are currently
to be made available to grandfathered enterprises.</p><p>For example, if $3.10 continues to be the MW applicable to a
grandfathered enterprise, the employer would be entitled to a tip credit not to
exceed 40% of $3.10, that is, $1.24 per hour. (Sec 3(m), as amended, effective
1/1/80.)</p>

            <p>For purpose of CL, enterprise coverage will continue to be asserted
with respect to employees of retail and service enterprises which have MW
obligations as a result of the grandfather clause, but which no longer meet the
higher dollar tests of Sec 3(s)(2). Although Sec 3(s) does not expressly
provide for the retention of enterprise coverage with regard to CL for
previously covered Sec 3(s)(2) enterprises, there is no evidence that Congress
intended such coverage to be eliminated.</p>

            <p>A gasoline service station enterprise comprised exclusively of one or
more retail or service establishments is subject to Sec 3(s)(2) coverage and
must be tested for ADV as any other retail or service enterprise (see FOH

Sec 3(s)(3) of the Act brings
within coverage employees employed in an enterprise which “is engaged in
laundering, cleaning, or repairing clothing or fabrics”. (There is no ADV test
for such enterprises.)</p><p>(b)          
Since enterprise coverage as
defined in Sec 3(s) of the Act includes “employees handling, selling, or
otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for
commerce by any person”, the requirement that some employees in the enterprise
engage in the named activities will be satisfied, for example, where some
employees in the enterprise handle or work with supplies received from outside
the State such as bleaches, soaps, or packaging materials such as cartons and
wrapping paper.</p>

following establishments are considered to be included in an enterprise which
is engaged in laundering, cleaning, or repairing clothing or fabrics:</p><p>(1)  Central laundry or dry cleaning establishments;</p><p>(2)  Laundry or dry cleaning establishments (generally
known in the trade as “valet shops” or “will-call” or “pickup and delivery”
stations) which receive from and return to their customers clothing or fabrics
for laundering, cleaning, or repairing at a central laundry or dry cleaning
establishment;</p><p>(3)  Coin-operated laundries (laundromats); and</p><p>(4)  Self-service cleaners.</p><p>In such cases the possibility of a family owned and operated
establishment should not be overlooked (see FOH 12b00).</p>

            <h3>12e03 - Laundry operations
by hotels. motels, or restaurants.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Employees of a hotel, motel, or
restaurant engaged in performing laundering, cleaning, or repairing of clothing
or fabrics will be covered on an enterprise basis under Sec 3(s)(3) if there
are in the hotel, motel, or restaurant enterprise employees “engaged in
commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, including employees
handling ... by any person”. However, a Sec 13(a)(2) exemption may still apply
to other employees of the hotel, motel, or restaurant who are not engaged in
such laundry operations if the test of that exemption are met. (See FOH
21cL01.)</p><p>(b)          
Generally, enterprise coverage
under Sec 3(s)(3) applies to employees of a hotel, motel, or restaurant who
regularly and recurringly perform laundering, cleaning, or repairing of
clothing or fabrics in the laundry or drycleaning portion of the establishment.
Thus, for example, employees who regularly and recurringly perform the actual
laundering work or who work in a pickup station or in a coin-operated laundry
operated by the hotel will be considered as engaged in laundering for purposes
of Sec 3(s)(3). On the other hand, a bellhop who merely picks up and returns
clothing to be laundered or dry-cleaned or a maid who merely handles linens
incident to the making or unmaking of beds would not be considered as so
engaged.</p>

            <p>The activities of the typical diaper service, i.e., the rental of

Sec 3(s)(3). Its operation is no different from that of a laundry which
specializes in renting laundered uniforms, towels, and linens.</p>

            <p>Painting, sandblasting, and tuckpointing are part of the construction
industry and are clearly a construction or reconstruction activity where
performed as an integral part of a definite construction or reconstruction job,
such as the renovation, remodeling, rehabilitation, or reconstruction of
existing structures or the construction of new structures. In addition,
contract painting, even though part of the ordinary maintenance of an existing
structure, is generally regarded as a part of the construction industry when
performed by an employer engaged in the business of painting, and would be
considered “construction or reconstruction” for purposes of Sec 3(s)(4).</p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="12f02"></div>
            <h3>12f02 - Installation as a
construction activity.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Certain business such as
establishments engaged in the sale of plumbing and heating equipment,
electrical fixtures and supplies, irrigation equipment, and fencing and siding,
in addition to selling goods, also install the goods which are sold. In
determining whether such installation constitutes engagement in “construction
or reconstruction” for purposes of Sec 3(s)(4), it is necessary to consider the
general characteristics of the entire transaction. At least in situations where
one or more of the following conditions are present the installation will normally
be considered as engagement in construction or reconstruction:</p><p>(1)  The cost of installation is substantial in relation to
the sale of the goods.</p><p>(2)  The installation involves substantial structural
changes, extensive labor, planning, or the use of specialized equipment.</p><p>(3)  The goods are being installed in conjunction with the
construction, renovation, remodeling, or reconstruction of a home or other
structure.</p><p>(4)  The goods installed are of a specialized type which
the general consuming public does not ordinarily have occasion to use.</p><p>(b)          
By way of example of the
principles involved, if the installation requires only minor carpentry,
plumbing, or electrical work (as may be the case where ordinary plumbing
fixtures, or household items such as stoves, garbage disposals, attic fans, or
window air conditioners are being installed or replaced), or where only labor
of the type required for the usual installation of chain link fences around a
home or small business establishment is involved, in the absence of any of the
criteria listed in (a) above, such installation will not normally be considered
as “construction or reconstruction”.</p><p>(c)           
In determining the cost of
installation in relation to the sale price of the goods pursuant to subsec
(a)(1) above and IB 779.321, the difference between the total price paid by the
purchaser for the installed job and the price charged him for the materials
used is the cost (to the purchaser) of installation.</p>

            <h3>12f06 - Landscaping as a
construction activity.</h3>
            <p>In some sales agreements between builders and individual home buyers,
the buyer contracts for a package arrangement whereby the completed home
includes the landscaping. In those cases where the general builder by contract
or agreement subcontracts the landscaping, the subcontractor is contributing
toward the actual construction of the completed home as contemplated by the
sales agreement. In such situations the activities of the landscaper, including
the planting of nursery products, the grading and seeding of lawns, and
construction of retaining walls, are closely identified with building the homes
and are considered to be “construction” for purposes of applying Sec 3(s)(4). </p>
        
            <a href="#">Back to top</a><div id="12f07"></div>
            <h3>12f07 - Floor covering
firms.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
The installation of hardwood
floors, wall tile, and floor tile is “construction or reconstruction” for
purposes of Sec 3(s)(4) whether performed in conjunction with original
construction or as a part of a remodeling or repair operation. Additionally,
contracts for relaying or refinishing floors on “insurance jobs” (such as
repair work due to fire or water damage) would be contracts for “reconstruction”
in the ordinary case.</p><p>(b)          
Where such a firm lays carpeting
or linoleum (as a contractor or subcontractor) as part of the construction or
reconstruction of a building, the activities may properly be classified as
“construction or reconstruction”. However, the laying of carpeting or linoleum
in existing premises may not be considered “construction or reconstruction”
when done merely to meet a customer’s request for covering or renewing a floor
since the actual construction work involved in such an operation is normally de
minimis.</p>

            <p>(a)           
Sec 3(s)(5) brings within the
coverage of the Act employees employed in an enterprise which “is engaged in
the operation of a hospital, an institution primarily engaged in the care of
the sick, the aged, the mentally ill or defective who reside on the premises of
such institution, a school for mentally or physically handicapped or gifted
children, an elementary or secondary school, or an institution of higher
education (regardless of whether or not such hospital, institution, or school
is public or private or operated for profit or not for profit)”.</p><p>(b)          
Effective 7/1/72, the Education
Amendments of 1972 amended Sec 3(s)(5) to include preschools within the
coverage of the Act. Sec 3(s)(5) as amended reads as follows:</p><p>“(5) is engaged in the operation of a hospital, an institution
primarily engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, the mentally ill or
defective who reside on the premises of such institution, a school for mentally
or physically handicapped or gifted children, a preschool, elementary or
secondary school or an institution of higher education (regardless of whether
or not such hospital, institution, or school is public or private or operated
for profit or not for profit), or”</p><p>Prior to 7/1/72, employees of preschools were not covered under Sec
3(s)(5).</p><p>(c)           
On June 24, 1976, the Supreme
Court in the case of National League of Cities. et al. v. Usery held that the
MW and OT provisions of the FLSA do not apply to State and local government
employees engaged in activities which are an integral part of traditional
government services. (See FOH 59d.) The Court expressly found that the
following activities were among those to which these provisions do not apply:
“schools, hospitals, fire prevention, police protection, sanitation, public
health, parks and recreation”. Additionally, there are certain activities
clearly reserved for State and local governments which DOL will regard as no
longer subject to MW and OT (e.g., the Courts, Legislatures and other governing
bodies, tax assessor’s office). The Court’s decision does not discuss
activities which might be regarded as “nontraditional” such as State liquor stores,
and utility and transit services. The majority opinion does state that the MW
and OT provisions could apply to a State’s operation of a railroad. Questions
which cannot be resolved because of uncertainty as to whether the function is
“traditional”, should be developed and referred to the RS for an opinion.</p><p>(d)          
The Court’s decision deals only
with the MW and OT provisions of the FLSA. It is our position that the decision
does not affect the application of the EP and CL provisions of the FLSA or of
the ADEA to employees of State and local governments, and that the provisions
continue to apply.</p>

            <h3>12g01 - Hospital defined.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
The FLSA does not define a
hospital. However, the term “hospital” refers to those establishments commonly
known as “hospitals” which primarily engaged in the offering of medical and
surgical services to patients who generally remain at the establishments either
overnight, several days, or for extended periods. Clinics and dispensaries are
not included within the term “hospital” unless operated by a hospital in the
hospital establishment.</p><p>(b)          
Based on considerations of the
standards and findings of other agencies and authoritative sources it is the
position of WH that any establishment described in (a) above which meets any of
the following three tests should be recognized as a hospital for purposes of
the FLSA:</p><p>(1)  Any establishment recognized by the U.S. department of

            <p>Such an institution (other than a hospital) is an institution primarily
engaged in (i.e., more that 50% of the income is attributable to) providing
domiciliary care to individuals who reside on the premises and who, if
suffering from physical or mental infirmity or sickness of any kind, will
require only general treatment or observation of a less critical nature than that
provided by a hospital. Such institutions are not limited to nursing homes,
whether licensed or not licensed, but include those institutions generally
known as nursing homes, rest homes, convalescent homes, homes for the elderly
and infirm, and the like. (See also FOH 25i and 12g12.)</p>

3(r) and 3(s) of the Act) which provides for the care and protection of infants
or preschool children outside their own homes during any portion of a 24-hour
day. The term “preschool” includes any establishment or institution which
accepts for enrollment children of preschool age for purposes of providing
custodial, educational, or development services designed to prepare the children
for school in the years before they enter the elementary school grades. This
includes day care centers, nursery schools, kindergartens. Head Start programs
and any similar facility primarily engaged in the care and protection of
preschool children.</p>

            <p>The word “hospital”, as used in the Act, refers to an institution (see
FOH 12f01) for the care of sick, wounded, infirm, or aged persons. A veterinary
hospital for the care of animals is not considered to be a hospital within the
meaning of Sec 3(s)(5). Consequently, employees of a veterinary hospital will
be covered on an enterprise basis only if the veterinary hospital meets the
tests of Sec 3(s)(1) or 3(s)(2), whichever is applicable (see FOH 21a01(d)).</p>

            <p>(a)           
The “enterprise” operating a
private institution of higher education normally consists of that institution’s
administrative and academic offices, custodial and maintenance functions and
facilities, physical plant and real estate. Many universities occupy more than
one campus and many others have a number of separate schools or departments in
separate geographical units. All the constituent elements relating to one or
more campuses, schools or departments, the operation of which is related and
performed through unified operations or common control for a common business
purpose would be considered a single enterprise for purpose of Secs 3(r) and
3(s)(5). Insofar as the operation of schools and related institutions is
concerned, the term “common business” encompasses those activities, whether performed
by one or more persons, corporations, or other organizational units, which are
directed to the same objective or objectives in which the enterprise is
interested.</p><p>(b)          
Pending interpretations by the
courts, Wage-Hour will take no position as to the application of the Act to
housekeepers, food service employees, or cleaning personnel who work

            <h3>12g09  - University and
college fraternity and sorority house - coverage.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Many universities and colleges
have on their campuses fraternity and sorority houses that provide dormitory
and dining hall facilities for students (members). In order to provide these
services such organizations may employ such personnel as house directors or
house mothers, cooks, maids, etc. These employees are generally paid from
revenues derived from the charges to members for items such as room, board, and
dues. in the ordinary case these organizations are controlled and operated by
the national and local chapter organization and the degree of supervision and
control by the educational establishment is likely to be quite casual and
nominal. As a general rule WH does not consider the operation of these
fraternity and sorority houses as a part of the college or university
enterprise within the meaning of Secs 3(r) and 3(s)(5).</p><p>(b)          
There may be instances where the
facts demonstrate that certain activities such as the provision of student
meals and lodging in the fraternity and sorority houses are part of the
university enterprise, as could be the case, for example, where the university
owns the houses or exercises a high degree of supervision and control. In such
doubtful situations, a careful study of the fraternity or sorority charter
provisions and the university rules applicable to such houses would be
essential in making a determination.</p><p>(c)           
While the general rule excludes
student meal and lodging activities in fraternity and sorority houses from
enterprises coverage under Sec3(s)(5), the possible application of Sec 3(s)(1)
to the fraternity or sorority enterprise should not be overlooked.</p>

            <h3>12g11  - Institutions of
higher education.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Although the term “institutions of
higher education” contained in Secs 3(r)(1) and 3(s)(5) is not defined in the
FLSA, the ordinary meaning of the phrase is that they are institutions above
the secondary level, such as colleges or universities, junior colleges,
professional schools of engineering, law, library science, social work, etc.
Generally, an institution of higher education is an educational institution
which:</p><p>(1)  Admits as regular students only individuals having a
certificate of graduation from a high school or the recognized equivalent of
such a certificate; and</p><p>(2)  Is legally authorized within a State to provide a
program of education beyond high school; and</p><p>(3)  Provides an educational program for which it normally
awards a bachelor’s degree, or provides not less than a two-year program which
is acceptable for full credit toward such a degree, or offers a two-year
program in engineering, mathematics, or the physical or biological sciences
which is designed to prepare the student to work as a technician and at a
semiprofessional level in engineering, scientific, or other technological
fields which require the understanding and application of basic engineering,
scientific, or mathematical principles or knowledge.</p>

            <p>For enforcement purposes, a private institution for the residential
care of emotionally disturbed persons would come within the coverage of Sec
3(s)(5) of the Act if more than 50% of its residents have been admitted by a
qualified physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist. For purposes of the 50%
test, the term “admitted” includes evaluations of mental or emotional
disturbance by a qualified physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist either
subsequent to admission to the institution or preceding admission and being the
cause for referral.</p>

            <h3>12g14 - “Community living
centers” and “halfway houses” for retarded persons.</h3>
            <p>For enforcement purposes, a private institution for mentally retarded
persons, sometimes called a “community living center” or a “halfway house”,
would come within the coverage of Sec 3(s)(5) of the Act, if more than 50% of
its residents have an IQ of 69 or less as determined on the basis of a valid
test administered by a qualified professional and a reasonable degree of “care”
is being provided. An IQ of 69 or below is considered “mentally defective”.
“Care” may include such services as waking up residents in the morning to see
that they get breakfast in time to leave for work, picking some up at night
after work, special counseling, instruction in money management and health
matters and generally keeping an eye on them and listening to problems. (See
also FOH 12g02 and 12g12.)</p>

            <h3>12g15 - “Care” of the aged
and infirm.</h3>
            <p>(a)           
Many establishments variously
referred to as “retirement hotels”, “retirement apartments”, “homes for…”, “senior
citizens retirement homes” and the like provide residences and other services
for older persons. In order to determine whether such an establishment may
qualify as an “institution primarily engaged in the care of the … aged …”, one
of the key questions is whether “care” is provided.</p><p>(b)          
The word “care” as it is used in
Sec 3(s)(5) is subject to a broad interpretation and encompasses routine
custodial services and attention. Institutions which care for the aged, (as
well as other institutions which care for the sick, or for the mentally ill or
defective), can vary from extremely well-serviced establishments to those of a
custodial type of servicing. Where an establishment must take full
responsibility of any nursing home or hospital care a resident requires, this
constitutes “care” of the resident. However, it does not necessarily follow
that to be a home for the aged, the establishment must be a nursing home or
otherwise medically oriented. If the aged occupants, in addition to receiving
food, shelter, and laundry, must be closely watched because their senile
condition necessitates their being supervised and guided, even though they
receive no medical attention, they may, depending upon all the facts, be
receiving “care” for the aged within the meaning of Sec 3(s)(5). (See also FOH
12g02, 12g12, and 12g14.)</p><p>(c)           
On the other hand, some apartment
hotels and retirement homes that cater to retirees and other elderly persons
who are completely ambulatory and in reasonably good health are not considered
institutions primarily engaged in the care of the aged who reside on the
premises. Even though such an establishment may furnish certain special
services, as for example, emergency pull bells in the bathroom connected to a
public address system in the office and a registered nurse on duty for an hour
each day to aid tenants if they need help in taking required medication, these
services may, depending upon all the facts, be just a part of a deluxe service
furnished by the establishment and such establishments would not be covered
under Sec 3(s)(5).</p>

            <h3>12g16 - Day care
homes--family owned and operated.</h3>
            <p>Certain day care homes are not covered on an enterprise basis because
they are family owned and operated (see last sentence of Sec 3(s)). Typically a
mother who is already caring for her own children will care for other parents’
children in her residence without the aid of any regular employees other than
her immediate family. Such residences are distinct establishments for purposes
of the Act and are excluded from enterprise coverage by the last sentence of
Sec 3(s) notwithstanding that such homes may be in some way affiliated with a
covered enterprise.</p>
