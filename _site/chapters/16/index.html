taxes due is an example of a wage attachment. This is the case even though
there may be no actual court proceeding involved in the tax lien or levy. (See
FOH 16c01.) Accordingly, such attachments are garnishments for purposes of the
discharge restriction in sec 304 of the CCPA.</p><p>(c)   An “administrative garnishment“ is an amount of money
withheld from a private sector employee’s disposable earnings for the payment
of a non-tax debt owed the federal government. Similar garnishments for federal
employees are called “salary offsets.” As used in this chapter, the term
“administrative garnishment” includes “salary offsets.” Usually, administrative
garnishments are instituted for the repayment of loans, such as those granted under
the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Administrative garnishments are garnishments
for purposes of the CCPA.</p><p>(1) 
They are authorized by and subject
to the terms of the Debt Collection Improvement Act (DCIA), 31 U.S.C. 3720D.
For federal employees the terms are set at 5 U.S.C. 5514. These laws generally
limit the garnishable amount to fifteen percent of disposable earnings. (See
(4) below.)</p><p>(2) 
The Higher Education Act (HEA)
authorizes guaranty agencies for student loans to administratively garnish up
to 10% of disposable earnings for defaulted student loans. The Department of
Education may garnish up to 15% under the DCIA.</p><p>(3) 
WH has no enforcement authority
with respect to such withholdings, provided they are within the CCPA’s limits.
Questions over the amount of withholding on an administrative garnishment,
where no CCPA violations are indicated, should be referred to the agency
initiating the withholding action. (See FOH 16a0l(b).)</p><p>(4) 
When a debtor agrees in writing to
allow withholding of an amount greater than the DCIA or HEA limits, the
deductions are considered wage assignments. (See (d) below.)</p><p>(d)  A “wage assignment” is a voluntary transfer of the
right to receive wages. It is ordinarily a private transaction accomplished
through a contract, without any court compulsion. A wage assignment is not a
garnishment within the meaning of the CCPA.</p>

public generally. They are enforced as matters of public, as well as private,

tips and gratuities.</h3>
              <p>The application of
garnishments to tips and gratuities under the CCPA is similar to the treatment
of their ownership under the FLSA.</p><p>(a)   Bona fide tips are not subject to the provisions of
the CCPA. A garnishment is inherently a procedural device designed to reach and
sequester earnings held by the garnishee (usually the employer). Tips paid
directly to an employee by a customer are not “earnings” within the meaning of
sec 302 of the CCPA, since they do not pass to the employer. This includes gratuities
transferred free and clear to an employee at the direction of credit customers
who add tips to the bill.</p><p>(b)  Service charges added to a customer’s bill constitute
“earnings” within the meaning of sec 302 when passed on to the employee. As
such, they are subject to the provisions of the CCPA. The following examples
demonstrate the point.</p><p>(1) 
A restaurant charges a customer
15% of the check, as a service charge, and in turn pays this amount to the
server (debtor). Since this is an automatic charge, there is no gratuity by the
customer. The compensation passed from the employer (garnishee) to the server.</p><p>(2) 
The employment agreement is such
that the customer’s tips belong to the employer and must be credited or turned
over to the employer.</p>

              <p>Sec 303 establishes limits
on the amount of earnings available for garnishment. These limits are based on
disposable earnings. (See FOH 16b0l.) The CCPA sets three levels of protection

not covered by the two other categories). The second concerns support payments
(that is, child support and alimony). The final level pertains to debts owed
for federal and state taxes or personal bankruptcy.</p><p>(a)   Garnishments for consumer debts must not exceed the
lower of:</p><p>(1) 
25 % of disposable earnings; or</p><p>(2) 
The amount by which disposable
earnings exceed 30 times the minimum wage multiplied by the number of weeks or
fraction thereof worked. (See FOH 16b02.)</p><p>The following chart shows
the current maximum garnishment of disposable earnings for consumer debts. It
is based on the $5.15 an hour minimum wage. These restrictions do not apply to
garnishments for child support, alimony, personal bankruptcy, or to recover
state or federal taxes. (See FOH 16b00(b) and (c).) </p><div>

</div><p>In this example, $125.00 is garnishable for consumer debts.
It does not matter that the employee’s disposable earnings for the second w/w
were less than $154.50, because the employer pays on a biweekly basis. In order
for any consumer garnishment to take place in a 2-week pay period, disposable
income must be greater than $309.00. In a biweekly pay period, when disposable
earnings are between $309.00 and $412.00, only the amount in excess of $309.00
is subject to such garnishment. When the disposable earnings are in excess of
$412.00, as in the above example, up to 25% of the biweekly disposable earnings
may be garnished for consumer debts. (See FOH 16b00(a).)</p><p>(2) 
A company pays on a semi-monthly
basis. Pay periods run from the 1st through the 15th and the 16th  through the
end of the month. The employer pays employees in full on the last day of the
pay period. The firm is served with a garnishment on the 17th. The debtor
employee has accrued two day’s disposable earnings in the amount of $200.00. No
wages would be subject to garnishment at this time, because in a semimonthly pay
period disposable earnings must be greater than $334.75 for any garnishment to
take place. (See FOH 16b00(a).) The employee’s disposable earnings in any
particular w/w are not material. Therefore, in those states that do not allow
the garnishment of future earnings, the employer could not withhold on a
garnishment order issued that day. The garnishment amount will be recomputed on
all wages for the period, if another garnishment is served at the end of the
pay period.</p><p>(c)   The restrictions of sec 303 are applicable to the pay
period of the individual whose earnings are subjected to garnishment. Where
there is a hold-back period for wages earned, the multiple limitations
prescribed in the Statute and Reg 870.10 are applied separately to the earnings
for each pay period. Earnings for two or more pay periods are not lumped
together.</p><p>(d)  Sec 302(a) of the CCPA states “[t]he term ‘earnings’
means compensation paid or payable for personal services, whether denominated
as wages, salary, commission, bonus, or otherwise, and includes periodic
payments pursuant to a pension or retirement program. ” The statutory definition
generally embraces compensation for personal services. When the employment contract
provides furnished facilities, such as meals and lodging, the dollar value of
the furnished facilities is part of the earnings and must be considered in
applying the restrictions of sec. 303(a).</p><p>(e)   The Supreme Court has held that the statutory terms
“earnings” and “disposable earnings” are, for the purposes of the CCPA,
generally confined to periodic payments of compensation. They do not pertain to
every asset that is traceable in some way to such compensation. (Kokoszka v. Belford,
417 US 642 (1974).) Under this decision, certain lump sum payments, such as tax
refunds, are neither periodic payments, nor subject to the limitations imposed
by the CCPA. The treatment of lump sum severance or pension payments is not
clear and contact should be made with the NO/OEP/FMLA Team with the facts
involved prior to making a final determination for any particular case. It is
WH’s position that bonuses are considered “earnings” for the pay period in
which they are received, and subject to the limits on garnishment.</p>

withholdings are not wages.</h3>
              <p>Part 531.39(b) states, “[w]hen
the payment to a third person of monies withheld pursuant to a court order
under which the withholding exceeds that permitted by the CCPA, the excess will
not be considered equivalent to payment of wages to the employee for purpose of
the Fair Labor Standards Act.” Therefore, amounts withheld by the employer from
an employee’s earnings under a garnishment order in excess of the withholdings
allowed by sec 303 of the CCPA are not wages pursuant to sec 3(m) of the FLSA.
Accordingly, where such excess withholdings decrease wages below the
compensation due under the FLSA a violation of that Act exists. This is not
altered by the fact that such excess withholdings are for the benefit of the
employee, paid to a third person and the employer derives no profit or benefit
from the transaction.</p><p><b>16bl0 - Draw against commission.</b></p><p>The definition of “earnings”
in sec 302(a) of the Act includes, “compensation paid or payable … whether
denominated as wages, salary, commission, ...” WH considers a draw against
commission to be earnings. As such, the draw is subject to the restrictions of
sec 303(a), in the same manner as other forms of compensation.</p><p>For example, for a period of
8 weeks an employee receives disposable earnings in the amount of $150.00 a
week, as a draw against commission. The employer may make no deduction pursuant
to a consumer debt garnishment during the 8 weeks, because only disposable earnings
in excess of $154.50 may be withheld. At the end of the 8-week period, the employee
receives $6,000.00 settling the remainder of commissions earned. After
subtracting the deductions required by law from this $6,000.00, 25% is
available for garnishment. The $1200.00 drawn during the first 8 weeks of this
period is not included in the total subject to garnishment. These wages
constitute the earnings subject to capture in each week of the eight week
period. (See FOH 16b00.) </p>

are separately applicable to each employer (garnishee), where an employee
(debtor) works for more than one employer in the same pay period. Each employment
must be separate and distinct (that is, the employers must be completely disassociated
and act independently of each other), in order for the garnishments to be
treated separately. An employee whose pay period is a week, and who works for
two different employers in the week receiving $140.00 in disposable earnings
from each is an example of such an employee. The employee’s wages are not
subject to garnishment for a consumer debt even though the total earnings for
the week are $280.00, because the employee’s disposable earnings from each
employer are less than $154.50. (See FOH 16b00(a).)</p>

              <p>Garnishments for consumer
debts may not exceed the amount permitted under sec 303(a). (See FOH 16b00(a).)
Support garnishments are limited to the amount permitted under sec 303(b)(2).
(See FOH  16b00(b).) Once the applicable limit is reached, no other garnishment
may be made, unless it is further excepted (for example, bankruptcy or state
taxes). The following example demonstrates the principle. Pursuant to a
garnishment order for support, an employer withholds $90.00 a week from the
wages of an employee who has disposable earnings of $240.00 a week. A
garnishment order for the collection of a retail credit debt is also served.
The sec 303(a)(l) limit for consumer debt garnishments of 25% applies to the retail
debt. Under the formula for consumer debts, a maximum of $60.00 (25% of
$240.00) is garnishable. The $90.00 support payments may be withheld, because
the restrictions of sec 303(a) do not apply to court orders for support. No
consumer debt garnishment may be made, because the amount already garnished is
more than the amount that may be withheld under sec 303(a)(l). Additional
withholdings could be made for those purposes listed in sec 303(b).</p>

              <p>Sec 304(a) provides a

subjected to garnishment for any one indebtedness. (See FOH 16c03.) Earnings
are subjected to garnishment when the employer is legally bound to make
deductions from the earnings of an employee to satisfy a garnishment order.
Where a binding garnishment order absorbs all disposable earnings and the
employer may, therefore, not make deductions for additional garnishments until
satisfying the first order, sec 304 prohibits discharge from employment until
the employer is legally bound to withhold for the second garnishment. Thus, in
such a case, there is no second garnishment until the second garnishment is
actionable.</p>

              <p>(a)   The term “one indebtedness” refers to a single debt,
regardless of the number of levies made or the number of separate garnishment
proceedings instituted in connection with the indebtedness. In cases of
garnishment after judgment, it is WH policy that the judgment itself is a
“debt.” This debt may represent one or more claims of a single creditor or the
claims of several creditors who joined in the proceeding. Also, the protection
against discharge is renewed with each employment since the new employer has
not been a garnishee with respect to that employee.</p><p>(b)  As provided in paragraph (a) above, there is a
distinction between a single debt and the garnishment proceeding brought to
collect it. After a garnishment proceeding for one debt becomes effective, the
law does not prohibit discharge if there is another garnishment proceeding
pursuant to a second debt. Such multiple garnishments need not be from
different creditors. They may be from the same or different creditors so long
as they involve separate debts. All of the facts in the particular case must be
considered, to determine whether there is more than one debt. Ordinarily, a
separate debt may be identified as the full amount of the debt represented by a
single judgment.</p><p>(c)   The distinction between a single debt and the
garnishment proceeding(s) brought to collect it has particular importance in
states only allowing garnishment of wages earned prior to the garnishment order
being served, or that of future wages subject to a time limitation. In such states,
the judgment creditor may need to secure a number of garnishment orders to
collect the full amount of the single debt represented by a judgment. Sec
304(a) prohibits discharge of an employee under such circumstances.</p><p>(d)  An employee discharged after a second garnishment that
occurred long after the first may have been discharged solely because of the
second garnishment. As a rule of thumb, where the interval between successive
garnishments for separate debts exceeds one year WH will carefully scrutinize a
discharge from employment following the latest garnishment. A determination of
whether a violation of sec 304(a) exists must be based on all the facts and circumstances.

              <h3>16c04 - Discharge - suspension,
demotion and/or transfer.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Although the protection provided by sec 304 is limited
to discharge, a suspension for an indefinite period or for so long that the
employee’s return to duty is unlikely may be considered tantamount to a
discharge. A careful examination of all the facts in a particular case is
needed to determine if the limitation on discharge provision applies to a
particular suspension action. A suspension would not be considered a discharge,
if the employee can obtain the funds necessary to satisfy the garnishment or
can otherwise secure a release from the garnishment. However, a suspension
action may be a “discharge” within the meaning of sec 304(a), if the employee
is unable to secure a release or obtain funds to satisfy the garnishment and is
no longer in pay status to enable the earning of wages to apply against the debt
(See FOH 52v13(b)(2).)</p><p>(b)  The term “discharge” is interpreted to include any
adverse action that interrupts employment to the degree that a prudent employee
would look for another job. A long suspension is considered tantamount to a
termination of employment, and thus a “discharge” within the meaning of sec 304(a).
For example, if an employer disciplines an employee by a series of gradually
increased suspensions of several days duration following subsequent
garnishments on the same indebtedness, it could result in a violation of sec
304(a). Even where a suspension is five or ten days long, the circumstances may
indicate that a discharge in violation of sec 304(a) exists.</p><p>(c)   A demotion and/or transfer based wholly or in part on
a single garnishment is constructively a discharge in violation of sec 304(a).
A reasonable interpretation of the effect of transferring a person to a
position paying less money is that of a discharge.</p>

which an improperly discharged employee or the DOL must file a complaint
pursuant to sec 304. In any case instituted solely under sec 304(a), the relief
sought is elimination of the adverse effects of the unlawful action and redress
of the employee’s rights by such means as attaining restoration to the same
employment held before wrongful discharge and restitution of the wages and
benefits lost as a result of the illegal discharge. Such relief is equitable in
nature.</p><p>(b)  In an equitable action, the employee’s neglect or
omission to assert a right is to be considered in terms of whether there has
been not mere delay but an inexcusable one prejudicial to the employer. Delay
operates as a bar against the assertion of rights provided the employee knows
of them and takes no steps to enforce them until the condition of the employer,
in good faith, becomes so changed that restoration to the employee’s former
state is impossible or where witnesses and records necessary to the employer’s
defense are no longer available. These are considerations in applying the
general rule that persons who seek the aid of equity must show the use of
reasonable diligence in asserting their rights and demanding their protection.
Inexcusable delay by the employee and consequent detriment to the employer will
generally prove a bar to the exercise of equity jurisdiction. (See FOH
