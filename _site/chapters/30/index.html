              <p>(a)   In
recording working time, insubstantial or insignificant periods of time outside
the scheduled working hours may be disregarded. The courts have held that such
trifles are de minimis. This rule applies only where a few seconds or minutes
of work are involved and where the failure to count such time is due to
considerations justified by industrial realities. An employer may not
arbitrarily fail to pay for any part, however small, of the employee’s fixed or
regular working time.</p><p>(b)   It has
been found that in some industries, particularly where time clocks are used,
there has been the practice of recording the employee’s starting and stopping
time to the nearest five minutes, or to the nearest one-tenth or quarter of an
hour. For enforcement purposes, this practice of computing working time will be
accepted, provided that it is used in such a manner that it will not result,
over a period of time, in the failure to compensate the employees properly for
all hours they have actually worked.</p><p>(c)   If a
record is kept with respect to each employee employed on a weekly or monthly
basis in an establishment or department thereof operating on a fixed schedule,
indicating the exact schedule of hours per day and hours per week which that
employee is normally expected to work, and if the payroll (or other) records
maintained by the employer indicate for each worker or for each group of
workers that such scheduled hours were, in fact, adhered to, this will be
considered compliance with Reg 516. When fewer or more hours than those fixed
by the schedule are worked, the employer must supplement this record by showing
the exact number of hours worked on the day and week involved.</p><p>(d)   The
records must also contain a statement made each pay period that, except where
otherwise recorded, the employees worked neither more nor less than the
scheduled hours. This policy is applicable only where hours of work are
actually fixed and it is unusual for the employee(s) to work either more or less
than the scheduled hours.</p>

shall be considered as equivalent to a weekly wage of $134.00 and accepted as
compliance with the $3.35 MW requirement if it is compensation for 40 hours of

to be paid in compliance if the overall earnings for the w/w equal or exceed
the amount due at the applicable MW. This is true regardless of whether the
employee is paid on the basis of a single hourly rate, different hourly rates,
commissions, certain bonuses, or some combination of these methods. In other
words, if the employee’s total earnings for the w/w (including certain bonuses
such as a production bonus - see FOH 30b07) divided by compensable hours equals
or exceeds the applicable MW, the employee has been paid in compliance with Sec
6. These principles will also apply where an employee is not compensated for
time which is compensable under FLSA. For example, if an employee subject to
the $3.35 MW during a w/w is paid for 32 hours at $5.50 per hour and is paid at
a lesser rate or nothing at all for 8 or fewer additional hours worked, this
individual is considered to have been paid in compliance with Sec 6. The WH

              <h3>30b05 - Employee compensated on a commission basis.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Many
employers, especially in retail enterprises, compensate certain employees
wholly or in part on a commission basis. The methods of computation and payment
involving commissions vary widely (see IB 779.413) and the determination of
MW/OT compliance must be made on the facts of each case. The general principles
(except in circumstances where Sec 7(i) is applicable) are as follows:</p><p>(b)   If an
employee paid wholly or in part on a commission basis is subject to OT, the
principles set out in IB 778.117 - 778.122 shall be followed.</p><p>(c)   If an
employee paid on a commission basis is exempt from OT, such as salespersons
referred to in Sec 13(b)(l0) of FLSA, the following shall be used in determining
whether the employee is paid in compliance with MW requirements:</p><p>(1)  There is no
requirement that wages be paid weekly, as long as some regular pay period (such
as biweekly or monthly) is established by the employer. The only requirement is
that employees receive “prompt payment” of the MW covering all hours worked
during the pay period.</p><p>(2)  A “settlement
period” does not have to coincide with the regular pay period. However, in the
absence of strong evidence to the contrary, it must be assumed that an employer
intended that a settlement period for commissions represents the pay period for
the affected employees. Where a pay (settlement) period exceeds one month, the
facts should be developed and the issue submitted to the NO (Attn: AA/OPO)
since the bona fides of the pay (settlement) period raise serious questions as
to the validity of the pay arrangement.</p><p>(3)  Periodic draws
against commission earnings within the pay (settlement) period need not equal
the MW. Employers may credit these draw or guarantee payments against their MW
obligation when settling out the amount due employees at the end of the pay
(settlement) period. The following examples illustrate this principle. Assume a
4-week month and that a commission salesperson exempt from OT works 50 hours a
week (50 x $3.35 - $167.50):</p><p>                                             
a.     The
employer has established payment of a weekly draw against commissions and a
monthly pay (settlement) period. The salesperson draws $125 a week against
earned commissions. By the pay (settlement) date, the commission salesperson
has earned $950 in commissions. The employer pays the salesperson $450 ($950 -
$500 previously paid by weekly draw). This commission salesperson has been paid
in compliance with the monetary requirements of FLSA by being paid at least the
MW for all hours of work during the pay (settlement) period.</p><p>                                             
b.     The
circumstances are the same as in a. above, but the employer only pays the
salesperson $170 at the end of the pay (settlement) period in order to bring
the individual up to the MW and carries the balance of $280 over, to be paid on
the next pay (settlement) period, thus crediting it toward the MW obligation
for that subsequent pay (settlement) period. This salesperson has also been
paid in compliance with FLSA. Commissions earned but not paid on the next pay
(settlement) date which are in excess of the amount required to satisfy MW
requirements may be carried forward and applied to the MW on subsequent pay
(settlement) dates.</p><p>                                             
c.     The
circumstances are the same as in a. above, except that the salesperson has
earned only $500 in commissions and is paid an additional $170 at the end of
the pay (settlement) period to meet the total MW ($3.35 x 200 - $670) due for
the hours worked during that month or pay period. At the end of the following
month, the salesperson has earned $1,000 in commissions. The employer deducts
from this amount the $170 that was paid the previous month to bring the
employee up to the MW. The employer pays the salesperson $670 ($3.35 x 200) and
carries the remaining $160 into the next month. This salesperson has also been
paid in compliance with FLSA. If the employer pays an additional amount ($170
the first month) to satisfy the MW, this amount may be recovered from excess
commissions earned but not paid in subsequent pay (settlement) periods.
Similarly, commissions earned but not paid in a given pay (settlement) period
which are in excess of the amount required to satisfy MW requirements may be
carried forward and applied to the MW on subsequent pay (settlement) dates.</p><p>                                             
d.     A
salesperson is paid four weekly draws of $150 each for a total of $600 for the
monthly pay (settlement) period. At the end of the month, the salesperson’s
commission earnings total $1,000. The employer deducts the $600 in draws from
this amount and pays the remainder (or excess) of $400 to the salesperson. The
following month, the salesperson is paid $600 in draws and earns no
commissions. To meet the MW obligation for the salesperson, the employer
applies $70 from the $400 excess earned and paid the previous month. This practice
is not in compliance with the requirements of FLSA. Any part of a commission
that is actually paid to the employee may not be carried forward as a credit
into subsequent pay (settlement) periods.</p><p>                                             
e.     Assume
the same 50-hour week and that the employer has definitely established a weekly
pay period and has a monthly settlement period. The salesperson draws $150 a
week against earned commissions. This salesperson has not been paid in
compliance with FLSA since this individual is not receiving the MW for all
hours worked in the pay period (50 x $3.35 - $167.50).</p><p>(Note: In example
“e”, the pay period is one week; in example “a”, the pay period is one month.)</p>

              <p>(a)   Section
6(a)(4) of FLSA permits an employer to calculate wages for seamen on the basis
of a period longer than a w/w. For example, wages for such employees may be
calculated over a longer period, such as for the entire voyage, on a monthly
basis, or, in appropriate cases, on a yearly basis. In those cases where wages
are calculated on other than a weekly basis, it is the responsibility of the
employer to demonstrate that a pay period of such duration is in accordance
with the established custom of the industry. In addition, the employee must
receive wages at not less than a rate which will provide, for the period
covered by the wage payments, wages equal to the MW for all hours during such
period when the employee is on duty. Thus, if a seaman is paid a monthly
salary, the total hours worked in the month, divided into the salary, must
yield at least the MW, regardless of the varying number of hours worked during
the weeks in the month. The same principle would apply if the wages were
computed on the basis of an entire voyage or on a yearly basis.</p><p>(b)   It is the
custom of some employers in the maritime industry to pay by the month or by the
voyage but, for the convenience of the employees, to make two or more partial
payments rather than a single payment covering the period involved. For example,
monthly compensation may be disbursed in two partial payments (semi-monthly),
or partial payments may be made weekly on the basis of 1/52nd of the annual pay
derived by multiplying 12 times the monthly salary. Such arrangements do not
affect the principles stated in (a) above.</p>

additional wages (for example, a production bonus) for those w/w’s included in
the bonus payment period. When the additional wages are added to the wages paid
on the regular payday, the results are either that the employee has received
not less than the MW for each hour worked during that week or that the amount
of the MW deficiency has been reduced. In such situations, a monetary violation
of the MW provisions exists since payment of not less than the MW required by
FLSA must be made on the regular payday for each w/w (see FOH 30b04). However,
where the additional wages for a particular w/w have actually been paid prior
to the investigation, and they are sufficient to bring the employee’s wages up
to the MW for each hour worked during that week, no MW violation shall be
reported for that w/w. If such additional wages paid prior to the investigation
are not sufficient to bring the employee’s earnings up to the MW for each hour
worked during that week, the amount of the remaining MW deficiency shall be
computed and reported. The employer shall be advised that no less than the MW
must be paid on each regular payday and the employer’s assurance of future
compliance shall be obtained.</p>

3(m) of FLSA permits an employer, under conditions specified in Reg 531, to
count toward its MW obligation, the “reasonable cost” of furnishing board,

3(m) also authorizes the Secretary to determine the “fair value” of the board,
lodging, or other facilities based upon average cost to the employer or to
groups of employers similarly situated, or on the average value to groups of
employees. Where “reasonable cost” under Sec 3(m) has been established by an
employer and appears to be excessive in relation to the facilities furnished,
it will be necessary to ascertain whether the “fair value” of the facilities in
question is lower than the “reasonable cost”. If so, the employer must use the
“fair value” rather than the “reasonable cost” in determining its wage
obligation. In no case will the “fair value” be utilized where it is greater
than the “reasonable cost”.</p><p>(b)   The cost
of board, lodging, or other facilities shall not be included as wages to the

agreement applicable to the particular employee. In most cases, a determination
whether such an exclusion exists will be based upon the written provisions of
the collective bargaining agreement.</p><p>(c)   Employees
must receive the benefit of the facility for which the employer is taking a
wage credit. Moreover, the reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing board,

              <h3>30c03 - Primarily for the benefit of the employee.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The
crediting by an employer of facilities furnished to employees as wages will
depend on whether such facilities are furnished primarily for the benefit or
convenience of the employee, as determined by WH. Where the primary benefit of
such facilities is to the employer’s business interest, credit will be denied.
The following are commonly viewed as furnished primarily for the benefit or
convenience of employees:</p><p>(1)  Meals</p><p>Meals furnished by
the employer are regarded as primarily for the benefit and convenience of the
employees. This rule does not apply, however, to the meal expenses incurred by
an employee while traveling away from home on the employer’s business. (See IB
778.217(b)(3).)</p><p>(2)  Lodging</p><p>Lodging, like meals,
is ordinarily considered for the benefit and convenience of the employee.
Circumstances may exist, however, where housing is of little benefit to
employees, as where an employer requires an employee to live on the employer’s
premises to meet some need of the employer, or where the employee must travel
away from home to further the employer’s business. In such circumstances, the
housing will be considered as primarily benefiting the employer. (Note: while
it may be to the employer’s advantage to provide such facilities at or near the
worksite, courts have consistently taken the view that the employer may take a
wage credit when the facilities are primarily for the benefit or convenience of
the employee.)</p><p>(3)  Transportation</p><p>                                             
a.     Transportation
furnished employees between their homes and work (i.e. normal, daily
home-to-work travel) where the travel time does not constitute hours worked is
generally an “other facility.” However, transportation which is an incident of
or necessary to the employment is not an “other facility.” (See FOH 30c13
regarding transportation of migrant and seasonal agricultural workers.)</p><p>                                             
b.     Transportation
furnished for normal home to work travel from a voluntary assembly point to a job
site and vice versa where the time does not constitute hours of work and the transportation
is primarily for the benefit of the employees is an “other facility.” In
contrast, travel to distant or remote job sites is normally for the employer’s
benefit and does not qualify as an “other facility.”</p><p>                                             
c.     Cars
furnished by an employer to employees primarily for the personal transportation
use of the employees and not primarily for company business are “facilities”
for which a wage credit may be claimed by the employer. (See FOH 30c11
regarding demonstrators used by automobile salespersons.)</p><p>(4)  Merchandise</p><p>Goods or merchandise,
such as clothing and appliances, may be considered “other facilities” under Sec
3(m) and Reg 531. Only the actual cost to the employer (not necessarily the
retail cost) may be taken as a wage credit.</p><p>(5)  Tuition
expenses</p><p>Tuition furnished to
an employee for courses or training for the individual’s own personal benefit
is a bona fide “facility” for which a wage credit may be taken, unless the
training is related to employment or is required to retain employment.</p><p>(6)  Child care</p><p>Child care facilities
which are furnished by an employer are bona fide “facilities” for which a wage
credit may be taken.</p>

              <h3>30c05 - Reasonable cost of facilities.</h3>
              <p>(a)   “Reasonable
cost” cannot exceed the actual cost to the employer. In deciding whether wage
credits for facilities are in amounts permissible under Sec 3(m) and Reg 531,
experience and judgment must be used by COs and ADs. It should be kept in mind
that the test in Reg 531.3 is “reasonable cost” rather than market value or
comparable prices. “Reasonable cost” does not include a profit to the employer.
The cost of furnishing lodging and/or other facilities must be established
based upon available records. The employer has the burden of establishing such
cost and must maintain adequate records to support a determination, as required
by Reg 516.27. Bills, purchase orders, and cash register tapes may be
appropriate for such purpose. A comparison of wage credits for comparable
facilities furnished by other employers in the area may also provide guidance.</p><p>(b)   The
method used by an employer for determining “reasonable cost” must be based on
good accounting practices. Good accounting practices do not include accounting
practices which are not accepted by the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p>(c)   Furthermore,
an employer may not take a credit where no cost is incurred. For example, when
a meal is made available to an employee, but is not consumed, and subsequently
is retained in the employer’s inventory for service to customers, no credit may
be taken.</p>

              <h3>30c06 - Examples of determining reasonable cost.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Meals -
Food service establishments</p><p>(1)  The “reasonable
cost” of meals furnished by a food service establishment to its employees
includes only the actual cost to the employer of the food, its preparation, and
related supplies. Salary or wage costs, as distinguished from material or
supply costs, may be claimed only to the extent that such salary or wage costs
are shown to be directly attributable to the cost of providing meals to
employees. If food preparation/serving employees of a food service
establishment would be paid the same rate of pay even if meals were not
provided to the employees of the establishment, their wage costs cannot be
included in determining reasonable cost. Conversely, if it were necessary to
hire extra personnel or pay higher wages to existing employees in order for
them to assist in furnishing meals to employees, such extra expense would be a
legitimate cost which could be included in determining the “reasonable cost” of
meals.</p><p>(2)  Costs which a
food service employer incurs regardless of whether the employees were furnished
meals may not be included in determining the “reasonable cost.” In a food
service establishment, items such as employee insurance, payroll taxes, menus,
decorations, other operating supplies, laundry, telephone, maintenance
services, advertising and promotion, building and equipment rental, licenses
and taxes, insurance and depreciation, franchise cost, and general
administrative costs are a part of the overall cost of the operation of the
employer’s business establishment which may not be charged to the reasonable
cost of employees’ meals.</p><p>(b)   Meals -
Non food service establishments</p><p>Determination of the “reasonable cost” of meals
furnished to employees of an establishment which is not a food service
establishment involve different criteria for expenses for which an employer may
take credit. For example, where meals are provided to employees of a non
food-service establishment by a catering service and there are no special
facilities wherein meals are consumed, the actual cost of the catering service,
assuming no rebate to the employer, would be the “reasonable cost.” In more
complex situations where dining areas are provided, the factors discussed in
(a) above must be considered in making a determination of the “reasonable cost”
of meals furnished to employees of a non food-service establishment.</p><p>(c)   Lodging</p><p>Employers taking credit for housing as part of
wages must show that the amounts charged are not more than the actual cost to
the employer. (See Reg 531.3(a).) However, if the actual cost of providing
lodging is more than its established rental value, the rental value shall be
deemed to be the reasonable cost of lodging. (See FOH 30c07.) The actual cost
to the employer generally involves the following factors:</p><p>(1)  Adequate
Depreciation.</p><p>Reg 531.3(c) allows
an employer to include “adequate depreciation” as an element of cost.
Depreciation is a concept primarily used in and extensively regulated under the
tax laws. Depreciation is applicable to certain capital goods (e.g. buildings,
vehicles, machines, etc.). It is never applicable to land. For purposes of Reg
531 “adequate depreciation” is not more than the amount of depreciation
actually claimed and allowed under the tax laws for the property in question
for the period in question. It should be noted that the amount of depreciation
allowable on any property may vary from year to year. If the employer declines
to provide tax returns or similar evidence as to the claim and allowance of
depreciation under the tax laws, no allowance will be made under Reg 531.3(c).</p><p>                                             
a.     For
tax purposes, depreciation might be claimed under several line items for
property involved in the furnishing of a facility. For example, an employer
furnishing lodging might properly claim the depreciation of the building at one
place; the depreciation of the beds at another; and the depreciation of linens
at another. The addition of several such items of depreciation could be
appropriate. Similarly, an employer might claim, in a single line item,
depreciation on a greater piece of property than is involved in furnishing the
facility in question. For example, the owner of a 20 unit motel who furnishes
one unit for the lodging of an employee might claim depreciation on the entire
motel building as a single line item. Under these circumstances, pro rata
allocation of the claimed depreciation would be required. In the example,
assuming no complications (e.g. no part of building used for other proposes;
all units equal size, etc.), the allowable depreciation would be 1/20 = 5
percent of the total depreciation taken.</p><p>                                             
b.     For
tax purposes, depreciation is claimed by the year and can be prorated as
appropriate.</p><p>(2)  Capital
Invested.</p><p>The computation of “a
reasonable allowance (not more than 5 1/2 percent) for interest on the
depreciated amount of capital invested by the employer” (as referred to in Reg
531.3(c)) is made as follows:</p><p>Step 1: An amount, V,
represents the total depreciable value of the property to the employer. (See
(1) above. This number is not derived from or necessarily related to “fair
market value”.) Ordinarily, this will be the purchase price plus the cost of
capital improvements. It should be noted that no part of the cost of land is
included.</p><p>Step 2: Compute the
amount, A, by which the depreciable value, V, exceeds the depreciation already
taken (or which might have been taken) as a tax deduction (i.e., subtract total
allowable depreciation to date from V, the result is A.) This number is
required to be reported on the employer’s tax returns. If the employer declines
to make tax returns available for verification, then A shall be deemed to be
zero. If A = 0, no further computation is required; the allowance for this part
is zero.</p><p>Step 3: Determine the
amount, E, of the employer’s equity in V. This would ordinarily be the sum of the
down payment, portions of mortgage payments applied toward principal, and the
cash contribution toward any capital improvements included in V.</p><p>Step 4: Compute (E/V)
times (A). Conceptually, this is the portion of the equity which has not been
“returned” to the employer through depreciation. A “reasonable allowance”,
i.e., a “return on investment” of up to 5 1/2 percent of this number, may be
included in the employer’s cost.</p><p>(d)   Cost of
operation</p><p>(1)  Annual costs of
operation incurred in furnishing lodging facilities must be considered in
making “reasonable cost” determinations: these include interest on loans to
purchase, maintain, or improve the lodging facility, taxes, repairs and
maintenance, insurance, and utilities (electricity, water, sewers, garbage collection,
fuel oil, and so forth.) Repair and maintenance expenses refer to the costs
which are not included under capital improvements. Only the portion of those
costs which are directly related to the lodging facility used by the
employee(s) may be taken into account in determining the actual cost of
providing the lodging. As an example, the cost of property insurance should be
prorated in proportion to the space of the lodging actually used by the
employee(s).</p><p>(2)  When the
employer leases a property from another person, the amount of rent paid by the
employer to the other person is considered part of the “reasonable cost”
provided that the rent charged provides no profit for the employer, directly or
indirectly. As an example, if an employer pays a higher rental charge with the
promise of a rebate from the property owner as an encouragement to lease
certain lodging facilities, such higher rent payment may not be used as a
component of the “reasonable cost” for leasing the lodging facilities. The
allowable “reasonable cost” amount would be the rent paid by the employer minus
the amount of rebate promised and received by the employer from the property
owner.</p><p>(3)  When
determining the weekly “reasonable cost” of a lodging facility which may be
claimed as a wage credit, the sum of the annual costs (as determined in (1) and
(2) above) is divided by the number of weeks during which the lodging facility
is used for occupancy. Where the facility is used for other purposes, in
addition to lodging, the annual cost is first prorated among the uses. Once the
weekly “reasonable cost” amount has been determined, it should be divided by
the actual number of occupants in the lodging facility where each is provided
an equal amount of living area. However, if the living areas within the lodging
facility are not equal in size, the weekly “reasonable cost” amount should be
divided by the square feet of the dwelling. The wage credit which may be
claimed per employee in such cases shall be based upon the number of square
feet occupied by the employee and /or that individual’s family.</p>

              <p>(a)   Where
uniforms are required by law, employer, or type of work</p><p>If the wearing of clean uniforms is required by
law, by the employer, or by the nature of the work, the financial burden of
furnishing or maintaining these clean uniforms may not be imposed upon the
employees if to do so would reduce their wages below the MW (see Reg
531.3(d)(2), 531.32(c) and 531.35).</p><p>(b)   Cost of and
time spent in maintaining uniforms</p><p>(1)  Where employee
uniforms require ironing, drycleaning, daily washing, commercial laundering, or
other special treatment, because of heavy soiling in work usage or in order to
meet cleanliness or appearance standards set by law, by an employer, or by the
nature of the work, the employees must, absent documentation of the greater or
lesser cost, be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs which reduce their
wages below the MW in accordance with the amounts set forth in (b)(3) below.</p><p>(2)  However, in
those instances where uniforms are (a) made of “wash and wear” materials, (b)
may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and (c) do not
require ironing or any other special treatment such as drycleaning, daily washing,
or commercial laundering, WH will not require that employees be reimbursed for
uniform maintenance costs. This position is not applicable where daily washing
is required and the employer furnishes or reimburses the employee for a single
uniform.</p><p>(3)  For enforcement
purposes, WH will accept the payment to the employee of $3.35 per week or 67
cents per day as satisfying this requirement.</p><p>(4)  Since the
uniform cost would presumably be the same for any day, regardless of the number
of hours worked, allocating this cost on an hourly basis should be avoided
except as in (d)(2) below. However, if an employer pays on a “cents-per-hour”
basis, no monetary violation will exist if the employees receive the full daily
and/or weekly amounts in each w/w as indicated in (3) above.</p><p>(5)  Where this
enforcement position is followed, the time spent in washing uniforms will not
be considered hours worked for either MW or OT pay purposes.</p><p>(6)  Employers or
employees are free to establish actual costs, as indicated in (d) below.</p><p>(c)   Employee
chooses not to use employer’s free laundry service</p><p>Where an employer gives notice to employees
that the employer will launder or clean all uniforms required to be worn by
employees, free of any charge, and all or some employees elect not to avail
themselves of such service, the employer will not be required to reimburse the
employees for expenses incurred by them for laundering or cleaning their
uniforms on their own.</p><p>(d)   Other
standards for determination of cost</p><p>(1)  The enforcement
position in (b)(3) above does not prohibit the determination of the cost of
laundering or maintaining uniforms from being made on some other basis, so long
as the actual cost does not cut into required MW or OT compensation. For
example, where an employer contracts with a laundry or rental service and in
turn charges the employees or requires the employees to bear the cost directly,
the actual cost may be used if reasonable.</p><p>(2)  Similarly,
where a specific amount has been negotiated under a bona fide collective
bargaining agreement (e.g., 5c for each hour worked), this amount may be used,
if reasonable.</p><p>(3)  Where the
employer does not use the flat daily or weekly basis set forth in subsec (b)(3)
above, it is essential that the CO determine and document in the case file the
actual cost incurred by the employee.</p><p>(4)  In preparing a
case for settlement or for litigation, the enforcement position in subsec
(b)(3) cannot be relied upon as a basis for action where the employer uses
another basis for reimbursing employees for uniform maintenance expenses.</p><p>(e)   Cost of
purchasing and repurchasing uniforms</p><p>(1)  When an
employee is required to purchase a uniform, the employee must be reimbursed for
the cost of the uniform to the extent that the expense cuts into the MW or OT
compensation required by FLSA/PCA/SCA/CWHSSA.</p><p>(2)  This
reimbursement must be made promptly on the regular payday for the w/w in which
the expense was incurred and may not be spread over the life of the garment.</p><p>(3)  Further,
employers may not avoid such costs by requiring employees to obtain uniforms
before starting the job. In such a case, the cost of the uniform is, in effect,
an advance of an expense that must be borne by the employer.</p><p>(4)  On the other
hand, where an employee already has a uniform which has been paid for by the
firm, and the employee is paid at least the MW and proper OT and there is a
clear understanding between the employer and the employee that so much per hour
will be paid in addition to the MW for the sole purpose of replacing an
existing uniform, and, in fact, the amount so paid is sufficient to purchase
replacement uniforms when worn out or no longer serviceable, no violation would
occur.</p><p>(f)   Definition
of “uniforms”</p><p>(1)  Although there
are no hard-and-fast rules in determining whether certain types of dress are
considered uniforms for purposes of Sec 3(m), the following principles are
applicable:</p><p>                                             
a.     If
an employer merely prescribes a general type of ordinary basic street clothing
to be worn while working and permits variations in details of dress, the
garments chosen by the employees would not be considered to be uniforms.</p><p>                                             
b.     On
the other hand, where the employer does prescribe a specific type and style of
clothing to be worn at work, e.g. where a restaurant or hotel requires a tuxedo
or a skirt and blouse or jacket of a specific or distinctive style, color, or
quality, such clothing would be considered uniforms.</p><p>                                             
c.     Other
examples would include uniforms required to be worn by guards, cleaning and
culinary personnel, and hospital and nursing home personnel.</p><p>(g)   Employee
elects to buy additional uniforms. in excess of number required</p><p>Where an employer supplies, free of charge, or
reimburses the employees for a sufficient number of uniforms required to be
worn, and all or some employees elect to purchase additional uniforms in excess
of the number required, the employer will not be required to reimburse the
employees for costs incurred in purchasing uniforms in excess of the required
number.</p><p>(h)  For the
application of these principles on uniforms under SCA, see FOH 14f01 and Reg
4.168(b).</p>

              <h3>30c13 - Deductions from wages of migrant and seasonal agricultural workers.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The
reasonable cost or fair value of facilities furnished a migrant or seasonal
agricultural worker are generally creditable as wages. (However, see FOH
30c03.) Examples of facilities for which deductions or credits are generally
permissible include:</p><p>(1)  Meals and
beverages actually furnished to the worker.</p><p>(2)  Off-the-job
insurance authorized by the worker.</p><p>(3)  Canteen
articles purchased by the worker, but not cigarettes or alcoholic beverages
sold to the worker, if such sales are determined to be unlawful by appropriate
local law enforcement authorities. Apparent violations of State or local
licensing laws should be referred promptly to the appropriate enforcement
authority. (See FOH 52a09, 53g03 and 54: WH-124.) Prior to disallowing a
deduction or wage credit based upon action by a State or local authority
concerning illegal sales, the matter should be discussed through JRC
procedures.</p><p>(4)  Lodging used by
a worker, including utility costs, unless required to be provided free of
charge pursuant to the employment contract or applicable law. However, no
credit may be taken nor may any charge be made where:</p><p>                                             
a.     workers
are required to live on the premises as a condition of employment or where for
other reasons the housing primarily benefits the employer rather than the
employee, or</p><p>                                             
b.     the
housing has been denied an occupancy permit because of failure to meet
substantive S &amp; H standards as determined by an inspection by any agency,
or</p><p>                                             
c.     S
&amp; H violations have been found for which MSPA CMPs are being assessed or
violations of substantive S &amp; H standards have been found by OSHA, a State,
or county agency. If the violations are corrected, a charge may be made or a
credit taken for such lodging only during the period of compliance.</p><p>(b)   ETA
regulations require that workers placed pursuant to a Job Service clearance
order who are unable to return daily to their permanent residence must receive
housing as a term and condition of their employment. Such workers (and
accompanying family members) must receive housing at no cost or public housing
which meets the Federal and State standards (20 CFR 653.501(d)(2)(xv)). Where
it appears that a deduction has been made or a wage credit taken in apparent
violation of ETA regulations, the matter should be reviewed through JRC before
disallowing the deduction or wage credit.</p><p>(c)   An
employer who makes deductions from the wages of workers for board, lodging or
other facilities or who furnishes such facilities to workers as additions to
wages is required to maintain records substantiating the cost of such
facilities in accordance with Reg 516.27.</p><p>(d)   In
Marshall v. Glassboro Service Association. Inc., the Third Circuit affirmed the
district court’s judgment that money advanced to farm workers for
transportation costs from Puerto Rico to the mainland was primarily for the
benefit of the employer and therefore could not be deducted from the workers’
wages to the extent it reduced the wages below the statutory minimum. The court
similarly upheld the district court’s conclusion that FLSA prohibits the
employer from taking a wage credit for facilities excluded from wages by the
terms of a labor agreement which is the functional equivalent of a
collective-bargaining agreement. The U.S. Supreme Court denied review. The
Court of Appeals also ruled that, regardless of the manner or method by which
the employer sought to pass on to its employees certain transportation costs,
where the effect was to bring the wage rate below the statutory minimum, such
practice was unlawful.</p><p>(e)   It is the
WH position that no deduction that cuts into the MW may be made for
transportation of migrant workers from the point of hire and return to that
point. This is so since in virtually all situations the transportation is
primarily for the benefit of the employer and transportation costs are an
incident of and necessary to the employment of migrant workers. Where an employer
advances money to migrant workers to cover transportation expenses from the
point of hire to a worksite, the employer may not recoup such advances when to
do so results in a worker receiving less than the statutory MW. Such remains
the case even though the transportation costs so recovered are accumulated and
subsequently returned to the worker at some specified time during the season or
upon the worker’s return to the point of hire, after the individual has worked
a full season or specified portion thereof. Further, such transportation costs
may not be included as part of an employer’s cost of furnishing board, lodging,
or other facilities.</p><p>(f)   Farm
labor contractors and agricultural associations often provide daily
transportation to both migrant and seasonal farmworkers as an integral part of
their business of supplying agricultural workers to those who use their farm
labor contracting services. Agricultural employers also transport their own
workers under similar circumstances. Such daily transportation is provided to
assure that sufficient workers will be available at the required time and place
since the workers being transported are needed to work upon perishable
commodities. Their availability for employment often depends upon being
provided transportation. Where alternative transportation is readily available
which the workers are permitted to use (i.e., personal auto or carpool
arrangements) and where they know the location of the place where they are to
work, the reasonable cost to an employer (or fair value, whichever is less) in
providing transportation may be creditable towards wages.</p><p>In contrast, where furnishing transportation to
workers is primarily for the benefit and convenience of the employer, and is
necessary to and an incident of the employment, it is not considered a facility
within the meaning of section 3(m). (See Reg 531.32(a) and (c).) Accordingly,
it is the WH position that:</p><p>(1)  Where the
transportation is an incident of and necessary to the employment, it is for the
benefit of the employer and no deduction may be made for the transportation of
migrant or seasonal farmworkers that cuts into the MW. For example,
transportation of migrant or seasonal farmworkers from the pickup point and
return to that point, or from the temporary labor camp to the fields or for the
return trip is transportation that is an incident of and necessary to the
employment.</p><p>(2)  Where the
transportation is not incidental to the employment, it is for the worker’s
benefit and deductions may be made which cut into the MW, provided that if such
transportation is subject to MSPA it must be furnished in vehicles which meet
all substantive Federal and State motor vehicle safety and insurance standards.
Transportation which is not incidental to the employment (and thus deductible)
includes:</p><p>                                             
a.     the
transportation of migrant workers to conduct personal business, such as trips
from the rural temporary labor camp to a laundry, post office, and grocery
store, and</p><p>                                             
b.     the
daily transportation of migrant and seasonal farmworkers, where alternative
transportation is readily available, which the workers have the option to use,
and they know where to report to work but choose to use the employer’s
transportation, provided that the transportation is not required to be
furnished by law or regulation.</p>

              <p>(a)   Pursuant
to Reg 531.38, taxes which are assessed against an employee and which are
collected by the employer and paid to the appropriate government agency may
constitute “wages”.</p><p>(b)   The same
principle applies to taxes which, although owed by the employee, are paid by
the employer. Thus, an employer may pay an employee’s share of social security
(FICA) taxes. Such payment constitutes “wages” and may therefore be credited
toward the MW and OT requirements.</p><p>(1)  Where an
employee receives the MW of $3.35, the employer and the employee must each make
an FICA contribution of 24 cents an hour ($3.35 x .0715 = .2395). (7.15 percent
is the current FICA rate which is, of course, subject to change.)</p><div>

              <p>Deductions for article that do not qualify as
“board, lodging, or other facilities” under FLSA section 3(m), such as tools,
equipment, cash register shortages, and other similar items, may be made in
non-OT workweeks (i.e.,. weeks of 40 hours or less, and weeks in which
statutory OT does not apply) provided the employee continues to receive, after
the deductions are made, any required MW, free and clear, for all compensable hours
worked in the week (i.e., average hourly earnings for the workweek after the
deductions are not less than the highest applicable MW enforced by WH).  (See
Regs 531.35 and 531.36.) Deductions for non-3(m) items that cut into the
highest applicable MW enforced by WH are illegal in a non-OT workweek unless
the law establishing that MW (e.g., DBRA, SCA, H-2A, H-1B, etc.) allows the
particular deduction from wages.  NOTE: If a MSPA contract specifically
discloses that the employer will make certain particularized deductions not
otherwise prohibited by other law, those deductions would be permitted. For
example, if a MSPA-covered employer disclosed a wage rate of $8.00/hour and
fully disclosed in writing at the time of recruitment that $1.50/hour would be deducted
for non-3(m) items, and the deductions are otherwise legal and not prohibited
by other applicable laws, then those fully-disclosed deductions are permitted
to reduce the hourly wage to below the $8.00/hour contracted “promised wage”
(i.e., to $6.50/hour). Furthermore, various other Federal, State and local laws
regulate payment of wages, prohibit or restrict payment of wages in services or
facilities, outlaw “kickbacks,” restrain assignments, and otherwise govern the
calculation of wages and frequency and manner of paying them. Nothing in the
FLSA or other WH-administered statutes, regulations, or interpretations
overrides or nullifies any higher standards or more-stringent provisions of
these other laws. (See Reg. 531.26.) (WH enforcement in non-OT workweeks is
limited to the highest applicable MW enforced by WH, which includes WH-enforced
prevailing wages when they apply (e.g., DBRA, SCA, H-1B, etc.).) If no OT has
been worked in a particular week, WH will not enforce any other State of local
MW higher than the highest MW applicable under the laws enforced by WH; the Inv
will advise the employer of the apparent violation of such other higher MW
standards and notify the appropriate authorities of the employer’s deductions
policies and possible underpayments that may have occurred. (See FOH 30b10.) Permissible
deductions in an OT week are discussed in FOH 32j08.</p>

(1) The tip provision applies on
an individual employee basis. Thus, an employer may claim the tip credit for             some
employees even though the employer cannot meet the requirements for others.</p><p>(2) In establishments
where employees perform a variety of different jobs, an employee’s status as
one who       “customarily and regularly receives tips” will depend on the
total fact situation and will be determined on       the basis of such
employee’s activities over the entire w/w.</p><p>(d)  
When an individual is employed in a tipped occupation and a
non-tipped occupation (dual jobs), the tip credit is available only for the
hours spent in the tipped occupation.  Also, such employee must customarily and
regularly receive at least $30 a month in tips.</p><p>(e)  
Reg 531.56(e) permits the taking of the tip credit for time
spent in duties related to the tipped occupation, even though such duties are
not by themselves directed toward producing tips (i.e. maintenance and preparatory
or closing activities).  For example a waiter/waitress, who spends some time
cleaning and setting tables, making coffee, and occasionally washing dishes or
glasses may continue to be engaged in a tipped occupation even though these
duties are not tip producing, provided such duties are incidental to the
regular duties of the server (waiter/waitress) and are generally assigned to
the servers.  However, where the facts indicate that specific employees are
routinely assigned to maintenance, or that tipped employees spend a substantial
amount of time (in excess of 20 percent) performing general preparation work or
maintenance, no tip credit may be taken for the time spent in such duties.</p>

              <h3>30d01  Retention
of tips by employee.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Pursuant to Sec 3(m), all tips
received (i.e., given to or designated for the employee by a patron) by a
“tipped employee” must be retained by the employee except to the extent that
there is a valid pooling arrangement.  Thus, the effect of the language of Sec
3(m) precludes an agreement between an employer and a “tipped employee” that
any part of tips received by such employee belongs to the employer and must be
turned over to the employer.  Further, the specific language added to Sec 3(m)
reinforces the intent of Congress that an employee who receives $30 per month
in tips is a tipped employee and that the employer and the employee cannot
agree to remove the employee from that status or agree to waive such employee’s
right to retain all tips received.  Such an employee must retain all tips
received from customers, whether in cash or through allocation by credit card
charges, and in addition must receive remuneration from the employer for at
least 60 percent of the applicable MW in the w/w.</p><p>(b)  
Where an employer does not strictly observe the provisions
of Sec 3(m), no tip credit may be claimed and the employees are entitled to
receive the full cash MW, in addition to any tips they may have received.  For
example, where an employer does not inform employees of the statutory
provision, or pays no wages to employees who receive tips, the full MW in cash
is due and no tip credit will be allowed.</p><p>(1)  Several
courts have held that an employer who did not comply with the tip credit
provisions of Sec 3(m) was not entitled to take a tip credit on a retroactive
basis.  For example, an employer who paid no wages (i.e., employees received
only tips) was required to pay the full MW to achieve retroactive compliance
rather than simply pay 60 percent of the MW as BWs.  Similarly, employers who
acquired all or a portion of employees’ tips were not permitted to take the tip
credit and, in addition, were required to restore the tips to the employees.</p><p>(2)  In
the past, in the administrative settlement of investigations which disclosed
violations of the tip credit provisions of Sec 3(m), WH permitted employers to
achieve retroactive compliance (for example, by restoring tips) and allowed
employers to retroactively claim the tip credit.  In view of the court
decisions, WH will not allow an employer to claim the tip credit on a
retroactive basis unless all aspects of Sec 3(m) have been met.  (Also see FOH
52n00.)</p>

would include using it to pay servers and/or server helpers

              <p>(a)  
The requirement that an employee must retain all tips does
not preclude tip-splitting or pooling arrangements among employees who
customarily and regularly receive tips.  The following occupations have been
recognized as falling within the eligible category:  </p><table>
 <tbody><tr>
  <td>
  <p>(1)  waiters/waitresses</p>

 </tr>
 <tr>

  </td>
  <td>
  <p>(5)  service
  bartenders</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table><p>It is not required that all
employees who share in tips must themselves receive tips from customers.  The
amounts retained by the employees who actually receive the tips, and
those given to other pool participants are considered the tips of the
individuals who retain them, in applying the provisions of sections 3(m) and
3(t).</p><p>(b)  
A valid tip-pooling arrangement cannot require employees
who actually receive tips to contribute a greater percentage of their tips than
is customary and reasonable.  For enforcement purposes, WH will not question
contributions to a pool where the net amount of tips contributed (after return
of any tips from the pool) does not exceed 15 percent of the employee's tips. 
However, only those tips that are in excess of tips used for tip
credit (e.g. where the maximum tip credit is taken, those in excess of 40
percent of the MW) may be taken for a pool.  If such requirements are met, it
is not necessary that the pooling be voluntarily consented to by the
employees involved (notwithstanding Reg 531.54).</p><p>(c)  
Tipped employees may not be required to share their tips
with employees who have not customarily and regularly participated in tip
pooling arrangements. The following employee occupations would therefore not be
eligible to participate:</p><table>
 <tbody><tr>
  <td>
  <p>(1)  Janitors</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>(3)  Chefs or
  cooks</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
  <p>(2)  Dishwashers</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>(4)  Laundry room
  attendants</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table><p>However,  it does not appear
that the Congress, even in requiring as a general principle that tipped
employees retain all their tips, intended to prevent tipped employees from
deciding, free from any coercion whatever and outside of any formalized
arrangement or as a condition of employment, what to do with their tips, including
sharing them with whichever co-workers they please.  Tips given to such
co-workers as are listed in this subsection may not, however, be used as a tip
credit.</p><p>(d)  
Questions regarding eligibility of employees to share in
tip pooling arrangements, and the percentage of tips that the eligible
employees are required to contribute to a pool which cannot be answered on the
basis of these guidelines should be submitted thru channels to the AA/OPO for
resolution.  In the case of host/hostesses, head waiters or seater/greeters and
other employees not referred to above, facts should be developed showing the
practices regarding their sharing of tips in the locality and type of
establishment involved.</p>

              <h3>30d05  Tips charges on credit cards.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Where
tips are charged on credit cards, WH will not question the reduction of the
credit card tips paid over to the employee if the amount deducted is no greater
than the percentage charged by the credit card company.  For example, where a
credit card company charges an employer 5 percent on all sales charged to its
credit service, the employer may pay the employee 95 percent of the tips
without violating FLSA.</p><p>(b)   Payment
of both MW and OT compensation, including the charged tips, due to a “tipped
employee” must ordinarily be made at the regular payday for the w/w, or when
the pay period covers more than a single w/w, at the regular payday for the
period in which the particular w/w ends (see FOH 30b04).  The procedures
required to process charges made by customers through credit cards may delay
actual receipt of the funds by the employer for one or two months. 
Nevertheless, the employer is required to pay over the charged tips to the
employee on the employee’s next regular payday.</p><p>(c)   In some
situations, a credit card transaction is not collected from a credit card
company.  In such cases, the employer is not required to pay a tipped employee
the amount of tips specified on the credit card slip.  Of course, this assumes
the inability to collect is not a result of the employer’s failure to submit
the slip for reimbursement, etc.</p><p>(d)   The
employer may recover from a tipped employee the tip amount stated on the
uncollected credit card slip if the tip amount has been paid to the tipped
employee.  This may be accomplished either by payroll deduction or by
out-of-pocket reimbursement by the employee to the employer.  Regardless of how
effectuated, the recovery of the tips should be accurately documented by the
employer.  However, the amount of uncollected credit card tips which are
recovered by the employer must not reduce the tips retained by the tipped
employee for the earlier w/w below the claimed tip credit.  The amount of tips
to be recovered which would cut into the claimed tip credit is unrecoverable by
the employer.</p><p>(e)   Where
there are tip pools, tip pool recipients are responsible for reimbursing the
employer for the share of tips from an uncollected credit card transaction
which was allocated into the tip pool.  The tipped employee who contributed to
the tip pool cannot be held accountable for tips which are not in the
individual’s possession.</p>

              <p>Section 6(e)(2) of FLSA provides:
“Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13 of this Act (except subsections
(a)(l) and (f) thereof) and the provisions of the Service Contract Act of 1965,
every employer in an establishment providing linen supply services to the
United States under a contract with the United States or any subcontract
thereunder shall pay to each of his employees in such establishment wages at
rates not less than those prescribed in subsection (b), except that if more
than 50 per centum of the gross annual dollar volume of sales made or business
done by such establishment is derived from providing such linen supply services
under any such contracts or subcontracts, such employer shall pay to each of
his employees in such establishment wages at rates not less than those
prescribed in subsection (a)(l) of this section”. (Effective 12/31/77, subsec (b)
provided for payment of wage rates not less than those provided in subsec
(a)(l).)</p>

              <h3>30f01 - Linen supply services.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The
application of section 6(e)(2) of FLSA is determined by the type of service
contracted for and not by the type of establishment performing the service.
Thus, for example, a laundry may provide linen supply service within the
meaning of Sec 6(e)(2).</p><p>(b)   The term
linen supply services as used in section 6(e)(2) of FLSA refers to the
supplying of various items to the Government on a rental basis by a contractor
who owns the item being supplied. On the other hand, the mere laundering of
items which are owned by the Government is a laundering service and is not a
“linen supply service” within the meaning of Sec 6(e)(2).</p><p>(c)   The term
“linen supply services”, in addition to including such services as the rental
of tablecloths, sheets, and pillowcases, would also include contracts for such
items as dresses, uniforms, other wearing apparel, bibs aprons, etc., of the
type used by barbers, doctors, waitresses, waiters, nurses, food workers,
beauticians, etc. It would not include services for such items as diapers,
laundry, or dry cleaning (family or commercial), nor services for such items as
industrial wiping towels, safety equipment and salvage, dust control - -
including treated dust tool covers and cloths, treated dust mops or rugs, or
for industrial work uniforms, such as those worn by mechanics and production
workers in heavy industry, machine shops, garages, service stations and the
like.</p>

              <p>The MW standard provided by section 6(e)(2) of
FLSA applies only within an establishment in which work is performed on a
government linen supply contract. Thus, where an employer operates more than
one establishment but performs on government linen supply contracts in only
certain of the establishments, WH will not assert application of Sec 6(e)(2) to
the establishments which do not perform on government linen supply contracts.</p>

              <p>The application of section 6(e)(2) of FLSA
depends on the performance of linen supply services to the government and not
on the coverage or exemption status of the establishment under the Act. Thus,
during any w/w in which the establishment is engaged in the performance of
linen supply services, the wage rate provided in Sec 6(b) of FLSA would be
applicable to all employees of the establishment other than those specifically
exempt under Sec 13(a)(l) of FLSA or those subject to a higher wage rate
pursuant to SCA.</p>
