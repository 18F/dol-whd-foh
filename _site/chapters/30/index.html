                  <p> </p><p>(a)   The
preservation of microfilms for the periods required by Reg 516 will satisfy the
requirements relating to preservation of records, provided that adequate
projection or other viewing equipment is available for inspecting the
microfilms, and provided the employer is prepared to make any extensions,
recomputations, or transcriptions which may be requested regarding the
information contained on the microfilms. The employer should insure that the
microfilms are clear reproductions of the original records, are identifiable as
to dates or pay periods, and are chronologically arranged before the original
records are destroyed.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   Situations
may be encountered where the original basic source document on which time
records are maintained is an automatic word or data processing memory. The
preservation of this data base for the periods required will satisfy Reg 516,

                  <p> </p><p>(a)   In
recording working time, insubstantial or insignificant periods of time outside
the scheduled working hours may be disregarded. The courts have held that such
trifles are de minimis. This rule applies only where a few seconds or minutes
of work are involved and where the failure to count such time is due to
considerations justified by industrial realities. An employer may not
arbitrarily fail to pay for any part, however small, of the employee’s fixed or
regular working time.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   It has
been found that in some industries, particularly where time clocks are used,
there has been the practice of recording the employee’s starting and stopping
time to the nearest five minutes, or to the nearest one-tenth or quarter of an
hour. For enforcement purposes, this practice of computing working time will be
accepted, provided that it is used in such a manner that it will not result,
over a period of time, in the failure to compensate the employees properly for
all hours they have actually worked.</p><p> </p><p>(c)   If a
record is kept with respect to each employee employed on a weekly or monthly
basis in an establishment or department thereof operating on a fixed schedule,
indicating the exact schedule of hours per day and hours per week which that
employee is normally expected to work, and if the payroll (or other) records
maintained by the employer indicate for each worker or for each group of
workers that such scheduled hours were, in fact, adhered to, this will be
considered compliance with Reg 516. When fewer or more hours than those fixed
by the schedule are worked, the employer must supplement this record by showing
the exact number of hours worked on the day and week involved.</p><p> </p><p>(d)   The
records must also contain a statement made each pay period that, except where
otherwise recorded, the employees worked neither more nor less than the
scheduled hours. This policy is applicable only where hours of work are
actually fixed and it is unusual for the employee(s) to work either more or
less than the scheduled hours.</p>

                  <p> </p><p>(a)   Where
time records show elapsed time greater than the hours actually worked because
of reasons such as employees choosing to enter their work places before actual
starting time or to remain after their actual quitting time, the CO shall
determine whether any time is actually worked in these intervals. If an
employee came in early for personal convenience and did no work prior to the
scheduled beginning time, a recording of the fact that the employee worked, for
example, 8 hours that day is all that is required.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   The CO
may suggest to the employer, but not require, that the punch-time be kept as
close to the work-time as possible to avoid any question that work was
performed during such intervals.</p><p> </p>

                  <p> </p><p>COs may find in the payroll records a single
figure (either daily or weekly) which represents the total hours actually
worked plus one-half of the OT hours, in lieu of separate entries for
straight-time and OT hours of work. This is particularly so where machine
posting methods are used. For example, if an employee works 50 hours in the
workweek and is entitled to OT pay after 40 hours, the “boosted hour” posting
will be 55 hours. The recordkeeping requirements are met in the case of hourly
rate employees by an entry showing “boosted hours”, provided the payroll or
other records contain sufficient information so that it is possible, with a
reasonable amount of recomputation, to ascertain weekly straight-time earnings
and weekly compensation for OT. Such information includes:</p><p> </p><p>(1)  actual hours
worked,</p><p> </p><p>(2)  regular hourly
rate of pay,</p><p> </p><p>(3)  additions to or

detail as to be able to ascertain the information in the required individual
items in the various sections of the Reg either upon direct review or through
extension, recomputation, or transcription, and the employer is preserving the
data for the periods specified. The use of symbols (such as checkmarks to
indicate a regular day’s work) in lieu of showing the hours worked as numerals
is acceptable, provided there is a key to the symbols which will permit a
determination of the time actually recorded as hours worked.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   The CO
may require an employer to make extensions, recomputations, or transcriptions
of records as provided in Reg 516.8 if determination of the employer’s
compliance status through direct review of the records is impracticable. Great
care must be exercised to avoid making unreasonable demands under the
regulations.</p><p> </p>

                  <p> </p><p>Any employer of employees to whom section 7 of
FLSA does not apply because of a total establishment exemption from that
section may alter or modify the FLSA poster so as to show that the OT
provisions do not apply to employees in the establishment. This may be done by
appending a note to that effect or by superimposing such a notation by a stamp
or other means across that part of the poster which pertains to the statutory
OT requirements. For example, in the case of railroad employees, the notation
may be worded as follows:</p><p> </p><p>“OVERTIME PROVISION NOT APPLICABLE TO RAILROAD
EMPLOYEES” (Sec 13(b)(2).)”</p><p> </p>

employers of an employee, the employer who actually pays the employee the
monies intended as compensation for hours of employment is considered
responsible for the keeping of records required by the Reg, and is treated as

                  <p> </p><p>(a)   Since the
number of regularly scheduled work hours may be greater in long months than in
short months, the strict allocation of a regular monthly salary to the hours
worked within each month may result in a technical MW violation in the longer
months. However, for enforcement purposes, a regular monthly salary of $580.67
shall be considered as equivalent to a weekly wage of $134.00 and accepted as
compliance with the $3.35 MW requirement if it is compensation for 40 hours of
work or less in the w/w. If the employer rounds out this amount to not more
than $585.00 per month, this will not affect the regular rate (i.e., $3.35) for
OT purposes.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   Where an
employee is paid a salary for a period in excess of a w/w (for example, on a
monthly or semi-monthly basis) and works an alternating schedule of fixed
w/w’s, and an equal allocation of the salary would result in payment of less
than the MW for the long w/w’s, there will be compliance with the MW provisions
of FLSA provided:</p><p> </p><p>(1)  the salary is
sufficient to meet the MW requirements for all hours worked during the pay
period; and</p><p> </p><p>(2)  there is an
agreement or understanding between the parties that a larger portion of the
salary is to be allocated to the longer w/w’s. The employer shall be advised
that the firm’s records should properly reflect the allocation of the salary on
a w/w basis.</p><p> </p>
                
                  <div id="30b02"></div><h3>30b02 - Minimum rate of pay for non-OT weeks.</h3>
                  <p> </p><p>In non-OT w/w’s or in w/w’s in which the OT
provisions do not apply, an employee subject to section 6 of FLSA is considered
to be paid in compliance if the overall earnings for the w/w equal or exceed
the amount due at the applicable MW. This is true regardless of whether the
employee is paid on the basis of a single hourly rate, different hourly rates,
commissions, certain bonuses, or some combination of these methods. In other
words, if the employee’s total earnings for the w/w (including certain bonuses
such as a production bonus - see FOH 30b07) divided by compensable hours equals
or exceeds the applicable MW, the employee has been paid in compliance with Sec
6. These principles will also apply where an employee is not compensated for
time which is compensable under FLSA. For example, if an employee subject to
the $3.35 MW during a w/w is paid for 32 hours at $5.50 per hour and is paid at
a lesser rate or nothing at all for 8 or fewer additional hours worked, this
individual is considered to have been paid in compliance with Sec 6. The WH
position regarding proper payment in w/w’s where OT is due is set out in 32j02.</p>

                  <p> </p><p>Payment of both MW and OT compensation due an
employee must ordinarily be made at the regular payday for the w/w or, when the
pay period covers more than a single week, at the regular payday for the period
in which the particular w/w ends. However, when it is not possible, prior to
preparing the payroll, to ascertain the number of OT hours worked by an
employee in the last w/w of the pay period, the requirements of
FLSA/PCA/SCA/CWHSSA will be satisfied if the employer pays the OT compensation
as soon after the regular payday as is practicable. Such a payment should not
be delayed for a period longer than is reasonably necessary for the employer to
compute and arrange for the payment of the amounts due, but, in any event, not
later than the next payday after such computation can be made.</p><p> </p>
                
                  <div id="30b05"></div><h3>30b05 - Employee compensated on a commission basis.</h3>
                  <p> </p><p>(a)   Many
employers, especially in retail enterprises, compensate certain employees
wholly or in part on a commission basis. The methods of computation and payment
involving commissions vary widely (see IB 779.413) and the determination of
MW/OT compliance must be made on the facts of each case. The general principles
(except in circumstances where Sec 7(i) is applicable) are as follows:</p><p> </p><p>(b)   If an
employee paid wholly or in part on a commission basis is subject to OT, the
principles set out in IB 778.117 - 778.122 shall be followed.</p><p> </p><p>(c)   If an
employee paid on a commission basis is exempt from OT, such as salespersons
referred to in Sec 13(b)(l0) of FLSA, the following shall be used in determining
whether the employee is paid in compliance with MW requirements:</p><p> </p><p>(1)  There is no
requirement that wages be paid weekly, as long as some regular pay period (such
as biweekly or monthly) is established by the employer. The only requirement is
that employees receive “prompt payment” of the MW covering all hours worked
during the pay period.</p><p> </p><p>(2)  A “settlement
period” does not have to coincide with the regular pay period. However, in the
absence of strong evidence to the contrary, it must be assumed that an employer
intended that a settlement period for commissions represents the pay period for
the affected employees. Where a pay (settlement) period exceeds one month, the
facts should be developed and the issue submitted to the NO (Attn: AA/OPO)
since the bona fides of the pay (settlement) period raise serious questions as
to the validity of the pay arrangement.</p><p> </p><p>(3)  Periodic draws
against commission earnings within the pay (settlement) period need not equal
the MW. Employers may credit these draw or guarantee payments against their MW
obligation when settling out the amount due employees at the end of the pay
(settlement) period. The following examples illustrate this principle. Assume a
4-week month and that a commission salesperson exempt from OT works 50 hours a
week (50 x $3.35 - $167.50):</p><p> </p><p>                                             
a.     The
employer has established payment of a weekly draw against commissions and a
monthly pay (settlement) period. The salesperson draws $125 a week against
earned commissions. By the pay (settlement) date, the commission salesperson
has earned $950 in commissions. The employer pays the salesperson $450 ($950 -
$500 previously paid by weekly draw). This commission salesperson has been paid
in compliance with the monetary requirements of FLSA by being paid at least the
MW for all hours of work during the pay (settlement) period.</p><p> </p><p>                                             
b.     The
circumstances are the same as in a. above, but the employer only pays the
salesperson $170 at the end of the pay (settlement) period in order to bring
the individual up to the MW and carries the balance of $280 over, to be paid on
the next pay (settlement) period, thus crediting it toward the MW obligation
for that subsequent pay (settlement) period. This salesperson has also been
paid in compliance with FLSA. Commissions earned but not paid on the next pay
(settlement) date which are in excess of the amount required to satisfy MW
requirements may be carried forward and applied to the MW on subsequent pay
(settlement) dates.</p><p> </p><p>                                             
c.     The
circumstances are the same as in a. above, except that the salesperson has
earned only $500 in commissions and is paid an additional $170 at the end of
the pay (settlement) period to meet the total MW ($3.35 x 200 - $670) due for
the hours worked during that month or pay period. At the end of the following
month, the salesperson has earned $1,000 in commissions. The employer deducts
from this amount the $170 that was paid the previous month to bring the
employee up to the MW. The employer pays the salesperson $670 ($3.35 x 200) and
carries the remaining $160 into the next month. This salesperson has also been
paid in compliance with FLSA. If the employer pays an additional amount ($170
the first month) to satisfy the MW, this amount may be recovered from excess
commissions earned but not paid in subsequent pay (settlement) periods.
Similarly, commissions earned but not paid in a given pay (settlement) period
which are in excess of the amount required to satisfy MW requirements may be
carried forward and applied to the MW on subsequent pay (settlement) dates.</p><p> </p><p>                                             
d.     A
salesperson is paid four weekly draws of $150 each for a total of $600 for the
monthly pay (settlement) period. At the end of the month, the salesperson’s
commission earnings total $1,000. The employer deducts the $600 in draws from
this amount and pays the remainder (or excess) of $400 to the salesperson. The
following month, the salesperson is paid $600 in draws and earns no
commissions. To meet the MW obligation for the salesperson, the employer
applies $70 from the $400 excess earned and paid the previous month. This practice
is not in compliance with the requirements of FLSA. Any part of a commission
that is actually paid to the employee may not be carried forward as a credit
into subsequent pay (settlement) periods.</p><p> </p><p>                                             
e.     Assume
the same 50-hour week and that the employer has definitely established a weekly
pay period and has a monthly settlement period. The salesperson draws $150 a
week against earned commissions. This salesperson has not been paid in
compliance with FLSA since this individual is not receiving the MW for all
hours worked in the pay period (50 x $3.35 - $167.50).</p><p> </p><p>(Note: In example
“e”, the pay period is one week; in example “a”, the pay period is one month.)</p><p> </p>
                
                  <div id="30b06"></div><h3>30b06 - Payment of MW to seamen on American vessels.</h3>
                  <p> </p><p>(a)   Section
6(a)(4) of FLSA permits an employer to calculate wages for seamen on the basis
of a period longer than a w/w. For example, wages for such employees may be
calculated over a longer period, such as for the entire voyage, on a monthly
basis, or, in appropriate cases, on a yearly basis. In those cases where wages
are calculated on other than a weekly basis, it is the responsibility of the
employer to demonstrate that a pay period of such duration is in accordance
with the established custom of the industry. In addition, the employee must
receive wages at not less than a rate which will provide, for the period
covered by the wage payments, wages equal to the MW for all hours during such
period when the employee is on duty. Thus, if a seaman is paid a monthly
salary, the total hours worked in the month, divided into the salary, must
yield at least the MW, regardless of the varying number of hours worked during
the weeks in the month. The same principle would apply if the wages were
computed on the basis of an entire voyage or on a yearly basis.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   It is the
custom of some employers in the maritime industry to pay by the month or by the
voyage but, for the convenience of the employees, to make two or more partial
payments rather than a single payment covering the period involved. For example,
monthly compensation may be disbursed in two partial payments (semi-monthly),
or partial payments may be made weekly on the basis of 1/52nd of the annual pay
derived by multiplying 12 times the monthly salary. Such arrangements do not
affect the principles stated in (a) above.</p>
                
                  <div id="30b07"></div><h3>30b07 - Crediting a bonus or other payments to a MW deficiency.</h3>
                  <p> </p><p>(a)   A bonus
or other payment which would not be considered a part of the regular rate may
not be offset against the MW due under FLSA. However, where such payments would
be considered a part of the regular rate, they are included with other wages
for purposes of determining compliance with the MW provisions of FLSA. (See IB
778.208 - 209.)</p><p> </p><p>(b)   Situations
may be encountered where the wages paid on the regular payday are not
sufficient to satisfy the MW, but the employee at some subsequent date is paid
additional wages (for example, a production bonus) for those w/w’s included in
the bonus payment period. When the additional wages are added to the wages paid
on the regular payday, the results are either that the employee has received
not less than the MW for each hour worked during that week or that the amount
of the MW deficiency has been reduced. In such situations, a monetary violation
of the MW provisions exists since payment of not less than the MW required by
FLSA must be made on the regular payday for each w/w (see FOH 30b04). However,
where the additional wages for a particular w/w have actually been paid prior
to the investigation, and they are sufficient to bring the employee’s wages up
to the MW for each hour worked during that week, no MW violation shall be
reported for that w/w. If such additional wages paid prior to the investigation
are not sufficient to bring the employee’s earnings up to the MW for each hour
worked during that week, the amount of the remaining MW deficiency shall be
computed and reported. The employer shall be advised that no less than the MW
must be paid on each regular payday and the employer’s assurance of future
compliance shall be obtained.</p><p> </p>

                  <p> </p><p>Certain employment, such as that in schools,
does not normally constitute 12 months of actual work each year. For the
convenience of the employee, the annual salary earned during the duty months is
often paid in equal monthly installments throughout the entire year. In
determining whether the statutory MW has been paid in such cases, the annual
salary is considered in relation to the duty months rather than in relation to
the entire year. Thus, for example, a school bus driver may receive an annual
salary of $6,000 for 10 months’ duty but be paid twelve equal monthly
installments of $500 each. In such case, the employee is considered as being
paid at the salary rate of $600 per month or $138.46 per week. Compliance with
the statutory MW is determined in the usual manner based on this weekly salary.

                  <p> </p><p>(a)   Section
3(m) of FLSA permits an employer, under conditions specified in Reg 531, to
count toward its MW obligation, the “reasonable cost” of furnishing board,
lodging, or other facilities which are customarily furnished to employees. Sec
3(m) also authorizes the Secretary to determine the “fair value” of the board,
lodging, or other facilities based upon average cost to the employer or to
groups of employers similarly situated, or on the average value to groups of
employees. Where “reasonable cost” under Sec 3(m) has been established by an
employer and appears to be excessive in relation to the facilities furnished,
it will be necessary to ascertain whether the “fair value” of the facilities in
question is lower than the “reasonable cost”. If so, the employer must use the
“fair value” rather than the “reasonable cost” in determining its wage
obligation. In no case will the “fair value” be utilized where it is greater
than the “reasonable cost”.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   The cost
of board, lodging, or other facilities shall not be included as wages to the
extent excluded therefrom under the terms of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement applicable to the particular employee. In most cases, a determination
whether such an exclusion exists will be based upon the written provisions of
the collective bargaining agreement.</p><p> </p><p>(c)   Employees
must receive the benefit of the facility for which the employer is taking a
wage credit. Moreover, the reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing board,
lodging, or other facilities (or the fair value thereof) must be included in
the employee’s R/R of pay for the purpose of computing OT pay.</p><p> </p>

                  <p> </p><p>(a)   The
reasonable cost of board, lodging, or other facilities may be considered as
part of the wage paid an employee only where “customarily furnished” to the
employee. This requirement is satisfied if either the facilities are furnished
regularly by the employer to its employees or if the same or similar facilities
are customarily furnished by other employers engaged in the same or similar
trade, business, or occupation in the same or similar communities. However,
“customarily furnished” does not require establishing an industry-wide practice
with regard to charges being made for facilities furnished to employees.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   Facilities
furnished in violation of any Federal, State, or local law, ordinance, or
prohibition will not be considered facilities customarily furnished, (e.g.
housing that has been denied an occupancy permit, or which, after inspection,
results in MSPA/CMPs). Any question as to whether facilities are furnished in
violation of any law should be referred to the AA/OPO for resolution. Any such
referral should include a detailed discussion of the facts and a copy of the applicable
law.</p>
                
                  <div id="30c03"></div><h3>30c03 - Primarily for the benefit of the employee.</h3>
                  <p> </p><p>(a)   The
crediting by an employer of facilities furnished to employees as wages will
depend on whether such facilities are furnished primarily for the benefit or
convenience of the employee, as determined by WH. Where the primary benefit of
such facilities is to the employer’s business interest, credit will be denied.
The following are commonly viewed as furnished primarily for the benefit or
convenience of employees:</p><p> </p><p>(1)  Meals</p><p> </p><p>Meals furnished by the
employer are regarded as primarily for the benefit and convenience of the
employees. This rule does not apply, however, to the meal expenses incurred by
an employee while traveling away from home on the employer’s business. (See IB
778.217(b)(3).)</p><p> </p><p>(2)  Lodging</p><p> </p><p>Lodging, like meals,
is ordinarily considered for the benefit and convenience of the employee.
Circumstances may exist, however, where housing is of little benefit to
employees, as where an employer requires an employee to live on the employer’s
premises to meet some need of the employer, or where the employee must travel
away from home to further the employer’s business. In such circumstances, the
housing will be considered as primarily benefiting the employer. (Note: while
it may be to the employer’s advantage to provide such facilities at or near the
worksite, courts have consistently taken the view that the employer may take a
wage credit when the facilities are primarily for the benefit or convenience of
the employee.)</p><p> </p><p>(3)  Transportation</p><p> </p><p>                                             
a.     Transportation
furnished employees between their homes and work (i.e. normal, daily
home-to-work travel) where the travel time does not constitute hours worked is
generally an “other facility.” However, transportation which is an incident of
or necessary to the employment is not an “other facility.” (See FOH 30c13
regarding transportation of migrant and seasonal agricultural workers.)</p><p> </p><p>                                             
b.     Transportation
furnished for normal home to work travel from a voluntary assembly point to a job
site and vice versa where the time does not constitute hours of work and the
transportation is primarily for the benefit of the employees is an “other
facility.” In contrast, travel to distant or remote job sites is normally for
the employer’s benefit and does not qualify as an “other facility.”</p><p> </p><p>                                             
c.     Cars
furnished by an employer to employees primarily for the personal transportation
use of the employees and not primarily for company business are “facilities”
for which a wage credit may be claimed by the employer. (See FOH 30c11
regarding demonstrators used by automobile salespersons.)</p><p> </p><p>(4)  Merchandise</p><p> </p><p>Goods or merchandise,
such as clothing and appliances, may be considered “other facilities” under Sec
3(m) and Reg 531. Only the actual cost to the employer (not necessarily the
retail cost) may be taken as a wage credit.</p><p> </p><p>(5)  Tuition
expenses</p><p> </p><p>Tuition furnished to
an employee for courses or training for the individual’s own personal benefit
is a bona fide “facility” for which a wage credit may be taken, unless the
training is related to employment or is required to retain employment.</p><p> </p><p>(6)  Child care</p><p> </p><p>Child care facilities

                  <p> </p><p>The following are examples of items not
considered bona fide “other facilities” under Sec 3(m) and Reg 531, because
they are provided primarily for the benefit or convenience of the employer:</p><p> </p><p>1.     Electric
power used for commercial production in the interest of the employer.</p><p> </p><p>2.     Telephones

                  <div id="30c05"></div><h3>30c05 - Reasonable cost of facilities.</h3>
                  <p> </p><p>(a)   “Reasonable
cost” cannot exceed the actual cost to the employer. In deciding whether wage
credits for facilities are in amounts permissible under Sec 3(m) and Reg 531,
experience and judgment must be used by COs and ADs. It should be kept in mind
that the test in Reg 531.3 is “reasonable cost” rather than market value or
comparable prices. “Reasonable cost” does not include a profit to the employer.
The cost of furnishing lodging and/or other facilities must be established
based upon available records. The employer has the burden of establishing such
cost and must maintain adequate records to support a determination, as required
by Reg 516.27. Bills, purchase orders, and cash register tapes may be
appropriate for such purpose. A comparison of wage credits for comparable
facilities furnished by other employers in the area may also provide guidance.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   The
method used by an employer for determining “reasonable cost” must be based on
good accounting practices. Good accounting practices do not include accounting
practices which are not accepted by the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p> </p><p>(c)   Furthermore,
an employer may not take a credit where no cost is incurred. For example, when
a meal is made available to an employee, but is not consumed, and subsequently
is retained in the employer’s inventory for service to customers, no credit may
be taken.</p>
                
                  <div id="30c06"></div><h3>30c06 - Examples of determining reasonable cost.</h3>
                  <p> </p><p>(a)   Meals -
Food service establishments</p><p> </p><p>(1)  The “reasonable
cost” of meals furnished by a food service establishment to its employees
includes only the actual cost to the employer of the food, its preparation, and
related supplies. Salary or wage costs, as distinguished from material or
supply costs, may be claimed only to the extent that such salary or wage costs
are shown to be directly attributable to the cost of providing meals to
employees. If food preparation/serving employees of a food service
establishment would be paid the same rate of pay even if meals were not
provided to the employees of the establishment, their wage costs cannot be
included in determining reasonable cost. Conversely, if it were necessary to
hire extra personnel or pay higher wages to existing employees in order for
them to assist in furnishing meals to employees, such extra expense would be a
legitimate cost which could be included in determining the “reasonable cost” of
meals.</p><p> </p><p>(2)  Costs which a
food service employer incurs regardless of whether the employees were furnished
meals may not be included in determining the “reasonable cost.” In a food
service establishment, items such as employee insurance, payroll taxes, menus,
decorations, other operating supplies, laundry, telephone, maintenance
services, advertising and promotion, building and equipment rental, licenses
and taxes, insurance and depreciation, franchise cost, and general
administrative costs are a part of the overall cost of the operation of the
employer’s business establishment which may not be charged to the reasonable
cost of employees’ meals.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   Meals -
Non food service establishments</p><p> </p><p>Determination of the “reasonable cost” of meals
furnished to employees of an establishment which is not a food service
establishment involve different criteria for expenses for which an employer may
take credit. For example, where meals are provided to employees of a non
food-service establishment by a catering service and there are no special
facilities wherein meals are consumed, the actual cost of the catering service,
assuming no rebate to the employer, would be the “reasonable cost.” In more
complex situations where dining areas are provided, the factors discussed in
(a) above must be considered in making a determination of the “reasonable cost”
of meals furnished to employees of a non food-service establishment.</p><p> </p><p>(c)   Lodging</p><p> </p><p>Employers taking credit for housing as part of
wages must show that the amounts charged are not more than the actual cost to
the employer. (See Reg 531.3(a).) However, if the actual cost of providing
lodging is more than its established rental value, the rental value shall be
deemed to be the reasonable cost of lodging. (See FOH 30c07.) The actual cost
to the employer generally involves the following factors:</p><p> </p><p>(1)  Adequate
Depreciation.</p><p> </p><p>Reg 531.3(c) allows
an employer to include “adequate depreciation” as an element of cost.
Depreciation is a concept primarily used in and extensively regulated under the
tax laws. Depreciation is applicable to certain capital goods (e.g. buildings,
vehicles, machines, etc.). It is never applicable to land. For purposes of Reg
531 “adequate depreciation” is not more than the amount of depreciation
actually claimed and allowed under the tax laws for the property in question
for the period in question. It should be noted that the amount of depreciation
allowable on any property may vary from year to year. If the employer declines
to provide tax returns or similar evidence as to the claim and allowance of
depreciation under the tax laws, no allowance will be made under Reg 531.3(c).</p><p> </p><p>                                             
a.     For
tax purposes, depreciation might be claimed under several line items for
property involved in the furnishing of a facility. For example, an employer
furnishing lodging might properly claim the depreciation of the building at one
place; the depreciation of the beds at another; and the depreciation of linens
at another. The addition of several such items of depreciation could be
appropriate. Similarly, an employer might claim, in a single line item,
depreciation on a greater piece of property than is involved in furnishing the
facility in question. For example, the owner of a 20 unit motel who furnishes
one unit for the lodging of an employee might claim depreciation on the entire
motel building as a single line item. Under these circumstances, pro rata
allocation of the claimed depreciation would be required. In the example,
assuming no complications (e.g. no part of building used for other proposes;
all units equal size, etc.), the allowable depreciation would be 1/20 = 5
percent of the total depreciation taken.</p><p> </p><p>                                             
b.     For
tax purposes, depreciation is claimed by the year and can be prorated as
appropriate.</p><p> </p><p>(2)  Capital
Invested.</p><p> </p><p>The computation of “a
reasonable allowance (not more than 5 1/2 percent) for interest on the
depreciated amount of capital invested by the employer” (as referred to in Reg
531.3(c)) is made as follows:</p><p> </p><p>Step 1: An amount, V,
represents the total depreciable value of the property to the employer. (See
(1) above. This number is not derived from or necessarily related to “fair
market value”.) Ordinarily, this will be the purchase price plus the cost of
capital improvements. It should be noted that no part of the cost of land is
included.</p><p> </p><p>Step 2: Compute the
amount, A, by which the depreciable value, V, exceeds the depreciation already
taken (or which might have been taken) as a tax deduction (i.e., subtract total
allowable depreciation to date from V, the result is A.) This number is
required to be reported on the employer’s tax returns. If the employer declines
to make tax returns available for verification, then A shall be deemed to be
zero. If A = 0, no further computation is required; the allowance for this part
is zero.</p><p> </p><p>Step 3: Determine the
amount, E, of the employer’s equity in V. This would ordinarily be the sum of the
down payment, portions of mortgage payments applied toward principal, and the
cash contribution toward any capital improvements included in V.</p><p> </p><p>Step 4: Compute (E/V)
times (A). Conceptually, this is the portion of the equity which has not been
“returned” to the employer through depreciation. A “reasonable allowance”,
i.e., a “return on investment” of up to 5 1/2 percent of this number, may be
included in the employer’s cost.</p><p> </p><p>(d)   Cost of
operation</p><p> </p><p>(1)  Annual costs of
operation incurred in furnishing lodging facilities must be considered in
making “reasonable cost” determinations: these include interest on loans to
purchase, maintain, or improve the lodging facility, taxes, repairs and
maintenance, insurance, and utilities (electricity, water, sewers, garbage collection,
fuel oil, and so forth.) Repair and maintenance expenses refer to the costs
which are not included under capital improvements. Only the portion of those
costs which are directly related to the lodging facility used by the
employee(s) may be taken into account in determining the actual cost of
providing the lodging. As an example, the cost of property insurance should be
prorated in proportion to the space of the lodging actually used by the
employee(s).</p><p> </p><p>(2)  When the
employer leases a property from another person, the amount of rent paid by the
employer to the other person is considered part of the “reasonable cost”
provided that the rent charged provides no profit for the employer, directly or
indirectly. As an example, if an employer pays a higher rental charge with the
promise of a rebate from the property owner as an encouragement to lease
certain lodging facilities, such higher rent payment may not be used as a
component of the “reasonable cost” for leasing the lodging facilities. The
allowable “reasonable cost” amount would be the rent paid by the employer minus
the amount of rebate promised and received by the employer from the property
owner.</p><p> </p><p>(3)  When
determining the weekly “reasonable cost” of a lodging facility which may be
claimed as a wage credit, the sum of the annual costs (as determined in (1) and
(2) above) is divided by the number of weeks during which the lodging facility
is used for occupancy. Where the facility is used for other purposes, in
addition to lodging, the annual cost is first prorated among the uses. Once the
weekly “reasonable cost” amount has been determined, it should be divided by
the actual number of occupants in the lodging facility where each is provided
an equal amount of living area. However, if the living areas within the lodging
facility are not equal in size, the weekly “reasonable cost” amount should be
divided by the square feet of the dwelling. The wage credit which may be
claimed per employee in such cases shall be based upon the number of square
feet occupied by the employee and /or that individual’s family.</p><p> </p>
                
                  <div id="30c07"></div><h3>30c07 - Fair value of facilities.</h3>
                  <p> </p><p>In those cases where cost to the employer is
not a true measure of the value of the facilities to the employees, it may be
appropriate to apply the “fair value” provisions of Sec 3(m). “Fair value” is
not synonymous with “reasonable cost.” The “fair value” of a facility allowable
under Sec 3(m) as wages may be utilized in lieu of the actual measure of cost
in determining the wages paid to any employee. Such a determination is
authorized for defined classes of employees and in defined areas based on
average cost or average value. To obtain a determination of “fair value”, the
facts specified in Reg 531.4 and 531.5 should be obtained and the issues
submitted to the AA/OPO.</p><p> </p>

531.30 provides that an employee’s acceptance of facilities must be “voluntary
and uncoerced.” The “voluntary and uncoerced” provision has been rejected in
several court of appeals and district court decisions regarding meals provided
to employees. WH no longer enforces the “voluntary” provision with respect to
meals. Therefore, where an employee is required to accept a meal provided by
the employer as a condition of employment, WH will take no enforcement action,
provided that the employer takes credit for no more than the actual cost
incurred. (See FOH 30c05 and 30c06).</p>

                  <p> </p><p>(a)   Although
sums paid by an employer under voluntary assignment of an employee to a third
party for the benefit of the employee are not bona fide “facilities”, they may
be deducted from the employee’s wages provided the employer does not directly
or indirectly benefit. Deductions for “administrative” or “bookkeeping
expenses” incurred by the employer in connection with such payments, however,
are illegal to the extent that they cut into the MW or OT pay due under FLSA.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   While
loans and cash advances made by an employer are not “facilities” the principal
may be deducted from the employee’s wages even where such a deduction cuts into
the MW or OT due under FLSA. Deductions for interest or administrative costs on
the loan or advance are illegal to the extent that they cut into the MW or OT
pay. The existence of the loan or advance shall be verified to the extent
possible.</p><p> </p><p>(c)   In the
situation where an employee is granted vacation pay prior to that individual’s
anniversary date, or the established date of entitlement, with the
understanding that such pay constitutes an advance of pay and the employee
quits or is terminated before the entitlement date, the employer may recoup the
advanced vacation pay, even where such recoupment cuts into the MW or OT pay
required under FLSA.</p><p> </p>

an employee is not furnished as a “facility” for purposes of Sec 3(m) if it is
an incident of and necessary to the employment or if the transportation is
furnished for travel by the employee which constitutes hours worked compensable
under FLSA (Reg 531.32(a) and (c).) Demonstrators which are provided to
automobile salespersons for their personal use as a form of advertising are not
primarily for the benefit of employees and do not constitute wages under FLSA.
This is true notwithstanding the fact that IRS may require employers to treat
as taxable income any portion of the benefit received by the employee.</p><p> </p>
                
                  <div id="30c12"></div><h3>30c12 - Cost of furnishing and maintaining uniforms.</h3>
                  <p> </p><p>(a)   Where
uniforms are required by law, employer, or type of work</p><p> </p><p>If the wearing of clean uniforms is required by
law, by the employer, or by the nature of the work, the financial burden of
furnishing or maintaining these clean uniforms may not be imposed upon the
employees if to do so would reduce their wages below the MW (see Reg
531.3(d)(2), 531.32(c) and 531.35).</p><p> </p><p>(b)   Cost of
and time spent in maintaining uniforms</p><p> </p><p>(1)  Where employee
uniforms require ironing, drycleaning, daily washing, commercial laundering, or
other special treatment, because of heavy soiling in work usage or in order to
meet cleanliness or appearance standards set by law, by an employer, or by the
nature of the work, the employees must, absent documentation of the greater or
lesser cost, be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs which reduce their
wages below the MW in accordance with the amounts set forth in (b)(3) below.</p><p> </p><p>(2)  However, in
those instances where uniforms are (a) made of “wash and wear” materials, (b)
may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and (c) do not
require ironing or any other special treatment such as drycleaning, daily
washing, or commercial laundering, WH will not require that employees be
reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. This position is not applicable where
daily washing is required and the employer furnishes or reimburses the employee
for a single uniform.</p><p> </p><p>(3)  For enforcement
purposes, WH will accept the payment to the employee of $3.35 per week or 67
cents per day as satisfying this requirement.</p><p> </p><p>(4)  Since the
uniform cost would presumably be the same for any day, regardless of the number
of hours worked, allocating this cost on an hourly basis should be avoided
except as in (d)(2) below. However, if an employer pays on a “cents-per-hour”
basis, no monetary violation will exist if the employees receive the full daily
and/or weekly amounts in each w/w as indicated in (3) above.</p><p> </p><p>(5)  Where this
enforcement position is followed, the time spent in washing uniforms will not
be considered hours worked for either MW or OT pay purposes.</p><p> </p><p>(6)  Employers or
employees are free to establish actual costs, as indicated in (d) below.</p><p> </p><p>(c)   Employee
chooses not to use employer’s free laundry service</p><p> </p><p>Where an employer gives notice to employees
that the employer will launder or clean all uniforms required to be worn by
employees, free of any charge, and all or some employees elect not to avail
themselves of such service, the employer will not be required to reimburse the
employees for expenses incurred by them for laundering or cleaning their
uniforms on their own.</p><p> </p><p>(d)   Other
standards for determination of cost</p><p> </p><p>(1)  The enforcement
position in (b)(3) above does not prohibit the determination of the cost of
laundering or maintaining uniforms from being made on some other basis, so long
as the actual cost does not cut into required MW or OT compensation. For
example, where an employer contracts with a laundry or rental service and in
turn charges the employees or requires the employees to bear the cost directly,
the actual cost may be used if reasonable.</p><p> </p><p>(2)  Similarly,
where a specific amount has been negotiated under a bona fide collective
bargaining agreement (e.g., 5c for each hour worked), this amount may be used,
if reasonable.</p><p> </p><p>(3)  Where the
employer does not use the flat daily or weekly basis set forth in subsec (b)(3)
above, it is essential that the CO determine and document in the case file the
actual cost incurred by the employee.</p><p> </p><p>(4)  In preparing a
case for settlement or for litigation, the enforcement position in subsec
(b)(3) cannot be relied upon as a basis for action where the employer uses
another basis for reimbursing employees for uniform maintenance expenses.</p><p> </p><p>(e)   Cost of
purchasing and repurchasing uniforms</p><p> </p><p>(1)  When an
employee is required to purchase a uniform, the employee must be reimbursed for
the cost of the uniform to the extent that the expense cuts into the MW or OT
compensation required by FLSA/PCA/SCA/CWHSSA.</p><p> </p><p>(2)  This
reimbursement must be made promptly on the regular payday for the w/w in which
the expense was incurred and may not be spread over the life of the garment.</p><p> </p><p>(3)  Further,
employers may not avoid such costs by requiring employees to obtain uniforms
before starting the job. In such a case, the cost of the uniform is, in effect,
an advance of an expense that must be borne by the employer.</p><p> </p><p>(4)  On the other
hand, where an employee already has a uniform which has been paid for by the
firm, and the employee is paid at least the MW and proper OT and there is a
clear understanding between the employer and the employee that so much per hour
will be paid in addition to the MW for the sole purpose of replacing an
existing uniform, and, in fact, the amount so paid is sufficient to purchase
replacement uniforms when worn out or no longer serviceable, no violation would
occur.</p><p> </p><p>(f)   Definition
of “uniforms”</p><p> </p><p>(1)  Although there
are no hard-and-fast rules in determining whether certain types of dress are
considered uniforms for purposes of Sec 3(m), the following principles are
applicable:</p><p> </p><p>                                             
a.     If
an employer merely prescribes a general type of ordinary basic street clothing
to be worn while working and permits variations in details of dress, the
garments chosen by the employees would not be considered to be uniforms.</p><p> </p><p>                                             
b.     On
the other hand, where the employer does prescribe a specific type and style of
clothing to be worn at work, e.g. where a restaurant or hotel requires a tuxedo
or a skirt and blouse or jacket of a specific or distinctive style, color, or
quality, such clothing would be considered uniforms.</p><p> </p><p>                                             
c.     Other
examples would include uniforms required to be worn by guards, cleaning and
culinary personnel, and hospital and nursing home personnel.</p><p> </p><p>(g)   Employee
elects to buy additional uniforms. in excess of number required</p><p> </p><p>Where an employer supplies, free of charge, or
reimburses the employees for a sufficient number of uniforms required to be
worn, and all or some employees elect to purchase additional uniforms in excess
of the number required, the employer will not be required to reimburse the
employees for costs incurred in purchasing uniforms in excess of the required
number.</p><p> </p><p>(h)  For the
application of these principles on uniforms under SCA, see FOH 14f01 and Reg
4.168(b).</p><p> </p>
                
                  <div id="30c13"></div><h3>30c13 - Deductions from wages of migrant and seasonal agricultural workers.</h3>
                  <p> </p><p>(a)   The
reasonable cost or fair value of facilities furnished a migrant or seasonal
agricultural worker are generally creditable as wages. (However, see FOH
30c03.) Examples of facilities for which deductions or credits are generally
permissible include:</p><p> </p><p>(1)  Meals and
beverages actually furnished to the worker.</p><p> </p><p>(2)  Off-the-job
insurance authorized by the worker.</p><p> </p><p>(3)  Canteen
articles purchased by the worker, but not cigarettes or alcoholic beverages
sold to the worker, if such sales are determined to be unlawful by appropriate
local law enforcement authorities. Apparent violations of State or local
licensing laws should be referred promptly to the appropriate enforcement
authority. (See FOH 52a09, 53g03 and 54: WH-124.) Prior to disallowing a
deduction or wage credit based upon action by a State or local authority
concerning illegal sales, the matter should be discussed through JRC
procedures.</p><p> </p><p>(4)  Lodging used by
a worker, including utility costs, unless required to be provided free of
charge pursuant to the employment contract or applicable law. However, no
credit may be taken nor may any charge be made where:</p><p> </p><p>                                             
a.     workers
are required to live on the premises as a condition of employment or where for
other reasons the housing primarily benefits the employer rather than the
employee, or</p><p> </p><p>                                             
b.     the
housing has been denied an occupancy permit because of failure to meet
substantive S &amp; H standards as determined by an inspection by any agency,
or</p><p> </p><p>                                             
c.     S
&amp; H violations have been found for which MSPA CMPs are being assessed or
violations of substantive S &amp; H standards have been found by OSHA, a State,
or county agency. If the violations are corrected, a charge may be made or a
credit taken for such lodging only during the period of compliance.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   ETA
regulations require that workers placed pursuant to a Job Service clearance
order who are unable to return daily to their permanent residence must receive
housing as a term and condition of their employment. Such workers (and
accompanying family members) must receive housing at no cost or public housing
which meets the Federal and State standards (20 CFR 653.501(d)(2)(xv)). Where
it appears that a deduction has been made or a wage credit taken in apparent
violation of ETA regulations, the matter should be reviewed through JRC before
disallowing the deduction or wage credit.</p><p> </p><p>(c)   An
employer who makes deductions from the wages of workers for board, lodging or
other facilities or who furnishes such facilities to workers as additions to
wages is required to maintain records substantiating the cost of such
facilities in accordance with Reg 516.27.</p><p> </p><p>(d)   In
Marshall v. Glassboro Service Association. Inc., the Third Circuit affirmed the
district court’s judgment that money advanced to farm workers for transportation
costs from Puerto Rico to the mainland was primarily for the benefit of the
employer and therefore could not be deducted from the workers’ wages to the
extent it reduced the wages below the statutory minimum. The court similarly
upheld the district court’s conclusion that FLSA prohibits the employer from
taking a wage credit for facilities excluded from wages by the terms of a labor
agreement which is the functional equivalent of a collective-bargaining
agreement. The U.S. Supreme Court denied review. The Court of Appeals also
ruled that, regardless of the manner or method by which the employer sought to
pass on to its employees certain transportation costs, where the effect was to
bring the wage rate below the statutory minimum, such practice was unlawful.</p><p> </p><p>(e)   It is the
WH position that no deduction that cuts into the MW may be made for
transportation of migrant workers from the point of hire and return to that
point. This is so since in virtually all situations the transportation is
primarily for the benefit of the employer and transportation costs are an
incident of and necessary to the employment of migrant workers. Where an
employer advances money to migrant workers to cover transportation expenses
from the point of hire to a worksite, the employer may not recoup such advances
when to do so results in a worker receiving less than the statutory MW. Such
remains the case even though the transportation costs so recovered are
accumulated and subsequently returned to the worker at some specified time during
the season or upon the worker’s return to the point of hire, after the
individual has worked a full season or specified portion thereof. Further, such
transportation costs may not be included as part of an employer’s cost of
furnishing board, lodging, or other facilities.</p><p> </p><p>(f)   Farm
labor contractors and agricultural associations often provide daily
transportation to both migrant and seasonal farmworkers as an integral part of
their business of supplying agricultural workers to those who use their farm labor
contracting services. Agricultural employers also transport their own workers
under similar circumstances. Such daily transportation is provided to assure
that sufficient workers will be available at the required time and place since
the workers being transported are needed to work upon perishable commodities.
Their availability for employment often depends upon being provided
transportation. Where alternative transportation is readily available which the
workers are permitted to use (i.e., personal auto or carpool arrangements) and
where they know the location of the place where they are to work, the
reasonable cost to an employer (or fair value, whichever is less) in providing
transportation may be creditable towards wages.</p><p> </p><p>In contrast, where furnishing transportation to
workers is primarily for the benefit and convenience of the employer, and is
necessary to and an incident of the employment, it is not considered a facility
within the meaning of section 3(m). (See Reg 531.32(a) and (c).) Accordingly,
it is the WH position that:</p><p> </p><p>(1)  Where the
transportation is an incident of and necessary to the employment, it is for the
benefit of the employer and no deduction may be made for the transportation of
migrant or seasonal farmworkers that cuts into the MW. For example,
transportation of migrant or seasonal farmworkers from the pickup point and
return to that point, or from the temporary labor camp to the fields or for the
return trip is transportation that is an incident of and necessary to the
employment.</p><p> </p><p>(2)  Where the
transportation is not incidental to the employment, it is for the worker’s
benefit and deductions may be made which cut into the MW, provided that if such
transportation is subject to MSPA it must be furnished in vehicles which meet
all substantive Federal and State motor vehicle safety and insurance standards.
Transportation which is not incidental to the employment (and thus deductible)
includes:</p><p> </p><p>                                             
a.     the
transportation of migrant workers to conduct personal business, such as trips
from the rural temporary labor camp to a laundry, post office, and grocery
store, and</p><p> </p><p>                                             
b.     the
daily transportation of migrant and seasonal farmworkers, where alternative
transportation is readily available, which the workers have the option to use,
and they know where to report to work but choose to use the employer’s
transportation, provided that the transportation is not required to be
furnished by law or regulation.</p><h4> </h4>

to Reg 531.38, taxes which are assessed against an employee and which are
collected by the employer and paid to the appropriate government agency may

principle applies to taxes which, although owed by the employee, are paid by
the employer. Thus, an employer may pay an employee’s share of social security
(FICA) taxes. Such payment constitutes “wages” and may therefore be credited
toward the MW and OT requirements.</p><p> </p><p>(1)  Where an
employee receives the MW of $3.35, the employer and the employee must each make
an FICA contribution of 24 cents an hour ($3.35 x .0715 = .2395). (7.15 percent
is the current FICA rate which is, of course, subject to change.)</p><p> </p><div>

business mileage rate (currently 28 cents per mile) represents depreciation,

                  <p> </p><p>Deductions for article that do not qualify as
“board, lodging, or other facilities” under FLSA section 3(m), such as tools,
equipment, cash register shortages, and other similar items, may be made in
non-OT workweeks (i.e.,. weeks of 40 hours or less, and weeks in which
statutory OT does not apply) provided the employee continues to receive, after
the deductions are made, any required MW, free and clear, for all compensable
hours worked in the week (i.e., average hourly earnings for the workweek after
the deductions are not less than the highest applicable MW enforced by WH). 
(See Regs 531.35 and 531.36.) Deductions for non-3(m) items that cut into the
highest applicable MW enforced by WH are illegal in a non-OT workweek unless
the law establishing that MW (e.g., DBRA, SCA, H-2A, H-1B, etc.) allows the
particular deduction from wages.  NOTE: If a MSPA contract specifically
discloses that the employer will make certain particularized deductions not
otherwise prohibited by other law, those deductions would be permitted. For
example, if a MSPA-covered employer disclosed a wage rate of $8.00/hour and
fully disclosed in writing at the time of recruitment that $1.50/hour would be
deducted for non-3(m) items, and the deductions are otherwise legal and not
prohibited by other applicable laws, then those fully-disclosed deductions are
permitted to reduce the hourly wage to below the $8.00/hour contracted
“promised wage” (i.e., to $6.50/hour). Furthermore, various other Federal,
State and local laws regulate payment of wages, prohibit or restrict payment of
wages in services or facilities, outlaw “kickbacks,” restrain assignments, and
otherwise govern the calculation of wages and frequency and manner of paying
them. Nothing in the FLSA or other WH-administered statutes, regulations, or interpretations
overrides or nullifies any higher standards or more-stringent provisions of
these other laws. (See Reg. 531.26.) (WH enforcement in non-OT workweeks is
limited to the highest applicable MW enforced by WH, which includes WH-enforced
prevailing wages when they apply (e.g., DBRA, SCA, H-1B, etc.).) If no OT has
been worked in a particular week, WH will not enforce any other State of local
MW higher than the highest MW applicable under the laws enforced by WH; the Inv
will advise the employer of the apparent violation of such other higher MW
standards and notify the appropriate authorities of the employer’s deductions
policies and possible underpayments that may have occurred. (See FOH 30b10.) Permissible
deductions in an OT week are discussed in FOH 32j08.</p><b><br />
</b><h3>30d - TIPS AND TIPPED EMPLOYEES</h3><p> </p>
                
                  <div id="30d00"></div><h3>30d00  General.</h3>
                  <p> </p><p>(a)   Tipped
employees are subject to the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.  Section 3(m) of the
FLSA permits an employer to claim a partial credit against its minimum wage
obligation to a tipped employee based on tips received by the employee.  This
credit against wages due is called a “tip credit.”  29 CFR Part 531 contains
further guidance on this topic.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   Section
3(m) of FLSA makes clear the intent of Congress to place on the employer the
burden of proving the amount of tips received by tipped employees and the
amount of tip credit, if any, which the employer may claim.  The employer may
not claim a tip credit greater than the tips received.  If the direct (or cash)
wage paid plus the tips received is less than the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage,
the employer is required to pay the balance so that the employee receives at
least the minimum wage with the combination of wages and tips.</p><p> </p><p>(c)   The
language of Sec. 3(m) was amended by the Small Business Job Protection Act of
1996.  Effective August 20, 1996, Sec. 3(m) provides:</p><p> </p><p>In determining the
wage an employer is required to pay a tipped employee, the amount paid such
employee by the employee’s employer shall be an amount equal to – (1) the cash
wage paid such employee which for purposes of such determination shall not be
less than the cash wage required to be paid such an employee on August 20,
1996; and (2) an additional amount on account of the tips received by such
employee which amount is equal to the difference between the wage specified in
paragraph (1) and the wage in effect under section 206(a)(1) of this title. 
The additional amount on account of tips may not exceed the value of the tips
actually received by an employee.  The preceding two sentences shall not apply
with respect to any tipped employee unless such employee has been informed by
the employer of the provisions of this subsection, and all tips received by
such employee have been retained by the employee, except that this subsection
shall not be construed to prohibit the pooling of tips among employees who
customarily and regularly receive tips.</p><p> </p><p>(d)   Tip
credit principles</p><p> </p><p>As amended in 1996, Sec. 3(m) limits the tip
credit an employer may claim to &quot;the difference between the wage specified
in paragraph (1) and the wage in effect under section 206(a)(1).”  Thus, the
tip credit is &quot;capped&quot; at the difference between the Sec. 6(a)(1)
wage and the direct or cash wage paid.  The cash wage paid may not be less than
the cash wage required to be paid a tipped employee on August 20, 1996, which
was $2.13 per hour.   Because Sec. 3(m) limits the tip credit to the difference
between the cash wage paid and the federal minimum wage, for purposes of the
FLSA, employees who are paid using the tip credit are paid the minimum wage.</p><p> </p><p>29 CFR 531.50</p><p>(1)  Definition of
Tipped Employee</p><p> </p><p>A “tipped employee”,
as defined in Sec. 3(t) of the FLSA, is any employee engaged in an occupation
in which the individual customarily and regularly receives more than $30.00 a
month in tips.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p><p> </p><p>Although some states
define “tipped employee” differently, the definition in Sec. 3(t) is used for
FLSA enforcement purposes.</p><p> </p><p>Tip provisions apply
on an individual employee basis. An employer may claim the tip credit for some
employees even though the employer cannot meet the requirements for others. (Rev.
563, 12/9/88)</p><p> </p><p>29 CFR 531.50(b)</p><p> </p><p>(2)  Tips are the
property of the employee</p><p> </p><p>A tip is a sum
presented by a customer to the tipped employee as a gift or gratuity in
recognition of some service performed for him.  Section 3(m) sets forth the
only ways in which an employer can use its employee's tips: as a partial credit
against its minimum wage obligations, or through a valid tip pool (defined in
FOH 30d04).  These restrictions on an employer's use of its employees' tips
apply even when the employer has not taken a tip credit.  </p><p> </p><p>29 CFR 531.52</p><p> </p><p>(3)  Notice
requirement</p><p> </p><p>An employer cannot take
a tip credit unless it informs the tipped employee of the provisions of Sec.
3(m) and allows the tipped employee to retain all tips, except to the extent
the employee participates in a valid tip pooling arrangement.  Where an
employer does not inform the tipped employee of the use of the tip credit, the
full minimum wage is due, no tip credit will be allowed, and the employee must
retain all tips received.  See FOH 30d01(c).</p><p> </p><p>29 CFR 531.59(b)
states that the employer must inform its tipped employees, in advance of taking
the tip credit, of the following requirements in Section 3(m):</p><p> </p><p>                                             
a.     The
amount of the cash wage that is to be paid to the tipped employee by the
employer, which may not be less than $2.13 per hour,</p><p> </p><p>                                             
b.     The
additional amount by which the wages of the tipped employee are increased on
account of the tip credit claimed by the employer,</p><p> </p><p>                                             
c.     The
amount of the tip credit claimed may not exceed the value of the tips actually
received by the employee,</p><p> </p><p>                                             
d.     All
tips received by the tipped employee must be retained by the employee except
for a valid tip pooling arrangement limited to employees who customarily and
regularly receive tips,  and</p><p> </p><p>                                             
e.     The
tip credit shall not apply to any employee who has not been informed of these
provisions.</p><p> </p><p>(e)   Dual Jobs</p><p> </p><p>(1)  When an individual
is employed in a tipped occupation and a non-tipped occupation – for example,
as a server and janitor (dual jobs) -- the tip credit is available only for the
hours spent in the tipped occupation, provided such employee customarily and
regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips. (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)  29
CFR 531.56(e).</p><p> </p><p>(2)  29 CFR
531.56(e) permits the employer to take a tip credit for time spent in duties
related to the tipped occupation of an employee, even though such duties are
not by themselves directed toward producing tips, provided such related duties
are incidental to the regular duties of the tipped employees and are generally
assigned to the tipped employee.  For example, duties related to the
tipped occupation may include a server who does preparatory or closing
activities, rolls silverware and fills salt and pepper shakers while the
restaurant is open, cleans and sets tables, makes coffee, and occasionally
washes dishes or glasses.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p><p> </p><p>(3)  However, where
the facts indicate that tipped employees spend a substantial amount of time (in
excess of 20 percent of the hours worked in the tipped occupation in the
workweek) performing such related duties, no tip credit may be taken for the
time spent in those duties.  All related duties count toward the 20
percent tolerance.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p><p> </p><p>(4)  Likewise, an
employer may not take a tip credit for the time that a tipped employee spends
on work that is not related to the tipped occupation.  For example,
maintenance work (e.g., cleaning bathrooms and washing windows) are not related
to the tipped occupation of a server; such jobs are non-tipped
occupations.  In this case, the employee is effectively employed in dual

                  <p> </p><p>(a)   As noted
above, tips are the property of the tipped employee who receives them whether
or not the employer claims a tip credit. Pursuant to Sec. 3(m), all tips
received (i.e., given to or designated for the employee by a patron) by a
“tipped employee” must be retained by the employee and the employer may only
utilize the employee’s tips as a partial credit against its minimum wage
obligation or in furtherance of a valid pooling arrangement. An employer and
employee cannot agree to waive such employee’s right to retain all tips received.
A tipped employee must retain all tips received from customers and in addition,
where the employer claims a tip credit, the employee must receive a direct or
cash wage from the employer at a rate of at least $2.13 per hour and must
receive at least enough in tips to equal the minimum wage when combined with
the direct wage.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p><p> </p><p>(b)   Tips the
employee receives in excess of the permissible tip credit are not considered
“wages.”  Where an employer has claimed a tip credit, under the FLSA it has
paid the employee only the federal minimum wage regardless of the amount of
tips received by the employee in excess of the tip credit amount.  Because the
employee has only received the minimum wage (through the direct or cash wage
and tip credit), any deductions by the employer for non-Sec. 3(m) items such as
uniform costs, cash register shortages, and meal walkouts would result in a
violation of the employer’s minimum wage obligation because it would reduce the
total compensation to less than the Sec. 6(a)(1) wage.</p><p> </p><p>(c)   Where an
employer does not strictly observe the provisions of Sec. 3(m), no tip credit
may be claimed and the employees are entitled to receive the full cash minimum
wage, in addition to retaining all tips they may have received. For example,
where an employer does not fulfill its obligation under 29 CFR 531.59(b) to
inform its tipped employees of the provisions of section 3(m), or pays no wages
to employees who receive tips, the full minimum wage in cash is due and no tip
credit will be allowed.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)  In addition, the employee must
retain all tips received.</p><p> </p><p>(1)  WHD will not
allow an employer to claim the tip credit on a retroactive basis where the
employer has not met the requirements for taking a tip credit.  For example, an
employer who pays no wages (i.e., employees received only tips) will be
required to pay the full minimum wage and will not be able to claim a tip
credit.  This same principle applies when the employer pays some cash wage but
less than the minimum required cash wage; for example, where the employer pays
a cash wage of $2.00 per hour the employer will be required to pay the full
minimum wage (offset by the $2.00 payment) and will not be able to claim a tip
credit.  Similarly, employers who require tipped employees to participate in
invalid tip pooling arrangements (FOH 30d04) will be required to restore the
tips to the employees and pay the full minimum wage.</p><p> </p><p>(2)  Employee
retention of tips when no tip credit is claimed</p><p> </p><p>Tips are property of
the employee even in situations where the employer takes no tip credit.  For
example, an employer who is prohibited by state law from taking a tip credit
and pays its employees the full minimum wage is prohibited from using its
employees’ tips other than in furtherance of a valid tip pool.  An employer
that does not take a tip credit would be in violation of the FLSA if it
requires its tipped employees to participate in an invalid tip pool that
includes individuals who do not &quot;customarily and regularly receive tips&quot;
under the terms of the statute, such as dishwashers and cooks.</p><p> </p><p>WHD will not enforce
the policy on ownership of tips under the FLSA prior to February 29, 2012, for
employers in the Ninth Circuit who did not take a tip credit.  See Field
Assistance Bulletin No. 2012-1 (Feb. 29, 2012).  This enforcement position does
not limit the rights of any employee in the Ninth Circuit to bring a private
action under Sec. 16(b).  The Ninth Circuit is comprised of the states of
California, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Hawaii, and
Arizona.  </p><p> </p>

situations.</h3>
                  <p> </p><p>Special minimum wages authorized under Sec.14
of FLSA are considered to be the “applicable minimum wage” in determining
amounts creditable toward the minimum wage for tips for purposes of Sec. 3(m). 
Thus, for example where an employee is subject to a SMW of $6.00 per hour, the
maximum permissible tip credit would be $3.87 ($6.00 SMW - $2.13 direct or cash
wage).  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p><h4> </h4>

                  <p> </p><p>A compulsory service charge (generally noted on
the menu) which is added to a customer’s bill is not part of the server’s
(waiters/waitresses) tip income but, rather, is included with the employer’s
gross receipts. Therefore, the employer has complete discretion in choosing the
manner in which the compulsory service charge is used, which would include
using it to pay servers and/or server helpers (busboys/busgirls). Where service
charges are imposed and the employees receive no tips, the employees are not
“tipped employees” and the employer must pay the entire minimum wage and
overtime required by FLSA.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)  If, in addition to service
charge income, the servers receive tips from customers, such tip income may be
credited toward the minimum wage in the usual manner if the employee qualifies
as a tipped employee and the employer has met all obligations to claim a tip
credit.</p><p> </p><p>29 CFR §§ 531.52 and .55</p><p>WHD Opinion Letter FLSA 2005-31</p><p> </p>

requirement that an employee must retain all tips does not preclude tip-splitting
or pooling arrangements among employees who customarily and regularly receive
tips.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)  Employer-required, or mandatory, tip pools may only
include employees who customarily and regularly receive tips.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   The
following occupations have been recognized as those in which employees
customarily and regularly receive tips:</p><p> </p><p>(1)  Waiters/Waitresses</p><p> </p><p>(2)  Counter
personnel who serve customers</p><p> </p><p>(3)  Bellhops</p><p> </p><p>(4)  Busboys/girls

Bartenders (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p><p> </p><p>In addition to the
above listed occupations, WHD has recognized the following occupations as ones
in which employees customarily and regularly receive tips:</p><p> </p><p>(1)  Sushi chefs or
teppanyaki chefs who are similar to counter persons because they have direct
contact and interact with customers, prepare and serve meals to customers in
the bar area or customer tables.</p><p> </p><p>(2)  Bartender
assistants or “barbacks” who are similar to bussers because they learn
bartending under the tutelage of a bartender, have the primary duty of
supporting the bartender, and receive their tips from the bartender.   Barbacks
work primarily in the bar area and have the opportunity to occasionally
interact with customers.</p><p> </p><p>(3)  Sommeliers who
explain the wine list, bring the selected bottle of wine to the table, and
serve the wine to the customers.</p><p> </p><p>WHD FLSA Opinion

decisions in a particular region that address the parameters of what
constitutes a customarily and regularly tipped employee. The DD and ADD’s
should inform WHI’s of any cases that may apply. If the DD and ADD’s are in
need of further guidance, they should consult with their respective RSOL.</p><p> </p><p>(c)   It is not
required that all employees who receive tips from a mandatory tip pool
themselves receive tips from customers as long as they work in an occupation
recognized as one in which employees customarily and regularly receive tips.
The amounts retained by the employees who actually receive the tips, and those
given to other pool participants are considered the tips of the individuals who
ultimately retain them, in applying the provisions of Sec. 3(m) and 3(t). 
(Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p><p> </p><p>(d)   The FLSA
does not restrict the amount of tips an employee can be required to contribute
to a valid tip pool.  The employer must notify the employees of any required
tip contribution amount, may only take tip credit for the amount of tips the
employee ultimately receives, and may not retain any of the employee’s tips for
any other purpose.  See 29 CFR 531.54.  </p><p> </p><p>(e)   Tips
contributed to a mandatory tip pool must not lower the rate of the employee
below the minimum wage. Only those tips that are retained by the employee
(either not contributed to a tip pool, or tips received from the tip pool) are
considered in determining if the employee has received the minimum wage.</p><p> </p><p>(f)   Tipped
employees may not be required to share their tips with employees who are not
working in occupations in which they customarily and regularly receive tips.
The following employees would therefore not be eligible to participate in a
mandatory tip pool:</p><p> </p><p>(1)  Janitors</p><p> </p><p>(2)  Chefs or cooks
(other than performance chefs)</p><p> </p><p>(3)  Dishwashers</p><p> </p><p>(4)  Laundry room

563, 12/9/88)</p><p> </p><p>(g)   However,
it does not appear that Congress, even in requiring as a general principle that
tipped employees retain all their tips, intended to prevent tipped employees
from deciding free from any coercion whatever and outside of any formalized
arrangement or as a condition of employment, what to do with their tips,
including sharing them with whichever co-workers they please. Tips given to
such co-workers as are listed in this subsection may not, however, be used as a
tip credit.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p><p> </p><p>(h)  Tip Jar: A tip
jar is a form of tip pooling and should be handled in accordance with the tip
pooling provisions set forth above.</p><p> </p><p>(i)    Questions
regarding eligibility of employees to share in tip pooling arrangements which
cannot be answered on the basis of these guidelines should be submitted through
channels to the NO/DEPP for resolution. In the case of host/hostesses, head
waiters or seater/greeters and other employees not referred to above, facts
should be developed showing the practices regarding their sharing of tips in
the locality and type of establishment involved.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p><p>            </p>
                
                  <div id="30d05"></div><h3>30d05 - Tips charged on credit cards.</h3>
                  <p>            </p><p>(a)   When tips
are charged to credit cards, the employer may reduce the amount of tips paid to
the employee by the percentage charged by the credit card company
(transactional fee). However the employer cannot reduce the amount of tips paid
to the employee by any amount greater than the transactional fee. For example,
where a credit card company charges an employer 5 percent on all sales charged
to its credit service, the employer may pay the employee 95 percent of the tips
without violating FLSA. (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p><p> </p><p>(b)   Payment
of both minimum wage and overtime compensation, including the charged tips, due
a “tipped employee” must ordinarily be made at the regular payday for the w/w,
or when the pay period covers more than a single w/w, at the regular payday for
the period in which the particular w/w ends. The procedures required to process
charges made by customers through credit cards may delay actual receipt of the
funds by the employer for one or two months. Nevertheless, the employer is
required to pay over the charged tips to the employee on the employee’s next
regular payday.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p><p> </p><p>(c)   In some
situations, a credit card transaction is not collected from a credit card company.
In such cases, the employer is not required to pay a tipped employee the amount
of tips specified on the credit card slip. Of course, this assumes the
inability to collect is not a result of the employer’s failure to submit the
slip for reimbursement, etc.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p><p> </p><p>(d)   Where a
credit card charge is uncollectible, the employer is not required to pay the
employee the amount of tip specified on such credit card slip.  Instead, the
employer may recover from a tipped employee those tips that have been paid to
the employee when the credit card charge is uncollectible; however, such
recovered tips may not reduce the tips retained by the employee below the
amount of the tip credit claimed in the earlier workweek.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p><p> </p><p>Where there are tip pools, tip pool recipients
are responsible for reimbursing the employer for the share of tips from an
uncollected credit card transaction which was allocated into the tip pool. The
tipped employee who contributed the uncollected tip to the tip pool can only be
held accountable for the portion of the uncollected tip the employee received
back from the tip pool.  For example, the tipped employee contributed $20.00 in
tips from a credit card transaction that ultimately is uncollected to the tip
pool and received back from the tip pool 70% of the tips contributed to the
pool.  The tipped employee can only be required to reimburse the employer for
the 70% of the $20 of the uncollected tip that the employee received from the
tip pool (i.e., $14).  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p><p> </p><p>(e)   Cost of
collecting tips charged on credit cards, over and above the amount charged by
the credit card company.</p><p> </p><p>Costs incurred by the employer related to
credit card use, other than the fee charged by a credit card company for
processing may not be used to reduce the amount of the tips the employer must
distribute to the tipped employee. Such costs include, but are not limited to:</p><p> </p><p>(1)  The “time value
of credit card collections,”</p><p> </p><p>(2)  The cost of the
credit card terminal, and</p><p> </p><p>(3)  The cost of
dedicated phone lines.</p><p> </p><p>Any employer attempt
to deduct an average standard composite amount for tip liquidation that exceeds
the amount charged by the credit card companies is not acceptable.</p><p> </p><p>WHD Opinion Letter

                  <p> </p><p>(a)   Section
3(m) limits the tip credit an employer may claim to the difference between the
Sec. 6(a)(1) wage and the cash wage paid by the employer. Under this formula,
the direct or cash wage paid by employer (which may not be less than $2.13 per
hour) plus the tip credit (the difference between the Sec. 6(a)(1) wage and the
cash wage paid) always equal the Sec. 6(a)(1) wage.</p><p> </p><p>(b)   Under
Sec. 3(m), the direct wage paid may be comprised of cash, board, lodging, or
facilities in accordance with 29 CFR part 531 and FOH 30c.  The tip credit
equals the difference between the minimum wage and the direct wage paid, which
may be comprised of cash, board, lodging, and/or facilities and must be at
least $2.13 per hour.</p><p> </p><p>(c)   Because
Sec. 3(m) caps a tipped employee’s wage at the minimum wage, an employer that
claims a tip credit may not make deductions for non-3(m) costs, such as
shortages, breakage, cost of uniforms, etc., because any such deduction would
reduce the tipped employee’s wages below the minimum wage.  Under the FLSA,
when the employer claims a tip credit, the tipped employee is considered to
have been paid only the minimum wage for all non-overtime hours worked in a
tipped occupation (for overtime hours, the regular rate may exceed the minimum
wage).  Even when an employer pays more than the $2.13 minimum direct wage, the
employee will have only received the minimum wage and non-3(m) deductions
cannot be made.  For example, if an employer pays a direct wage of $3.13, the
tip credit will be $4.12 and the employee will have only received the minimum
wage.  Non-3(m) deductions may only be made from a tipped employee’s wages when
the employer does not claim a tip credit and pays a direct wage in excess of
the minimum wage.</p><p> </p><p>Updating Regulations Issued Under the Fair

taken by an employer are concurrently applicable, it is the employer’s
responsibility to comply with the more protective wage standard.  (Rev. 563,

appropriate payroll records.</p><p> </p><p>(1)  When the state

contracted for and not by the type of establishment performing the service.
Thus, for example, a laundry may provide linen supply service within the
meaning of Sec 6(e)(2).</p><p> </p><p>(b)   The term
linen supply services as used in section 6(e)(2) of FLSA refers to the
supplying of various items to the Government on a rental basis by a contractor
who owns the item being supplied. On the other hand, the mere laundering of
items which are owned by the Government is a laundering service and is not a
“linen supply service” within the meaning of Sec 6(e)(2).</p><p> </p><p>(c)   The term
“linen supply services”, in addition to including such services as the rental
of tablecloths, sheets, and pillowcases, would also include contracts for such
items as dresses, uniforms, other wearing apparel, bibs aprons, etc., of the
type used by barbers, doctors, waitresses, waiters, nurses, food workers,
beauticians, etc. It would not include services for such items as diapers,
laundry, or dry cleaning (family or commercial), nor services for such items as
industrial wiping towels, safety equipment and salvage, dust control - -
including treated dust tool covers and cloths, treated dust mops or rugs, or
for industrial work uniforms, such as those worn by mechanics and production
workers in heavy industry, machine shops, garages, service stations and the
