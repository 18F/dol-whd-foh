<p>In many instances, farm workers are furnished their meals, lodging, and other facilities. In the ordinary case, for purposes of applying Sec 3(m) (Reg 531), the employer may treat as wages the reasonable cost or fair value of board, housing, fuel, and a garden plot furnished the employee. Where such facilities as a house and garden plot are furnished to a family that has several members working on the employer’s farm during the year, no more than the amount representing the reasonable cost to the employer, or the fair value, can be charged to the entire family occupying the house.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The MW exemption component of Sec 13(a)(6) does not apply with respect to any employee employed by an establishment which is part of a &quot;conglomerate&quot; as defined in Sec 13(g).

<h4 id="b01---off-farm-driving.-1">20b01 - &quot;Off-farm&quot; driving.</h4>
<h4 id="section-3"> </h4>
<p>Workers not employed by the farmer, such as the harvesting crew of a canner, processor, packer, or independent contractor, or employees of a &quot;chicken factory&quot; or hatchery, are employed in &quot;agriculture&quot; if they are employed &quot;on a farm&quot; in duties which constitute &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;secondary&quot; agriculture as defined in IB 780, Subpart B. The fact that a minor or incidental part of the work of such employees occurs off the farm will not change the situation. This is true, for example, where a small amount of time within the w/w is spent by an employee in transporting equipment or other employees to and from the farm or between farms, or where the &quot;off-farm&quot; driving is isolated or sporadic.</p>
<p><strong>20b02 - Field packers not employed by the farmer. </strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Employees not employed by the farmer (such as employees of a shipper, packer, or independent harvesting contractor) are employed in &quot;agriculture&quot; if they are engaged in &quot;field packing&quot; lettuce, celery, asparagus, cabbage, or other vegetables involving closely comparable packing operations.</p></li>
<li><p>”Field packing&quot; by such employees must be performed either in the field or on the edge of the field where the vegetables are grown, and without a substantial lapse of time between harvesting and packing. Included in this term are such operations as: setting up or distributing packing containers; sorting, trimming and washing the vegetables; placing the vegetables in containers; closing or fastening the containers; cooling (but not freezing) the vegetables; and loading. Operations performed away from the field or its edge, including transportation to market or to shipping points, unloading, cooling or reloading are not within the meaning of &quot;field packing&quot; and are not considered &quot;agriculture&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Where such employees are engaged in &quot;field packing&quot; vegetables in situations not closely comparable to packing lettuce, celery, asparagus, or cabbage, or in &quot;field packing&quot; fresh fruits, the question shall be referred to the Adm.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>20b03 - Stripping of tobacco in an independent warehouse. </strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The stripping of tobacco in an independent warehouse that prepares the crop for market is not a practice performed &quot;by a farmer&quot; if performed by employees of the warehouse, even though the warehouse employs as strippers, the farmers who grew the tobacco. In a situation where tobacco farmers and their tenants exchange services in stripping tobacco grown by them, careful examination of the arrangement is necessary to determine whether the strippers:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Are individually employed in turn by each farmer (in which event they would be considered as employed in &quot;agriculture&quot;, if the stripping performed for each farmer is a subordinate part of his activities), or</p></li>
<li><p>Are employed by the warehouse (in which event the stripping is not performed &quot;by a farmer&quot;), or</p></li>
<li><p>Are jointly employed by the several farmers (in which event it cannot be said that the stripping is incidental to any particular farmer’s farming operations, and they would not be considered as employed in &quot;agriculture&quot;).</p></li>
<li><p>However, see Sec 7(m) and FOH Secs 20i00, 20t00, and 20t01.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>20b04 - Fish farming.</strong></p>
<p>Fish farming is included in the term &quot;farming in all its branches&quot; and an employee performing such activities is engaged in agriculture within the meaning of Sec 3(f) (see IB 780.109 and 780.120). The possibility of exemption under Sec 13(a)(5) or a combination of exemptions should not be overlooked (see FOH 25d02 and IB 784).</p>
<p><strong>20b05 - Employees of nurseries or florists engaged in caring for plants obtained from other growers. </strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>In some cases nursery operators and florists purchase or secure agricultural or horticultural commodities, such as rooted cuttings or young plants, from others and it becomes necessary to determine whether the activities of particular employees in connection with these commodities constitute primary agriculture, i.e., &quot;cultivation, growing.. . .&quot; within the meaning of Sec 3(f). In making such a determination it is necessary to consider all the facts and circumstances including whether the operations performed on the plants are calculated to produce growth to maturity or substantial maturity or whether the operations are merely designed to care for and preserve the plants while they are on the employer’s premises. Among the factors to be considered are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The stage of development of the plant at the time it is obtained, i.e., whether it is immature, substantially mature or fully matured; and</p></li>
<li><p>The nature and purpose of operations performed on the plant; and</p></li>
<li><p>The length of time the plant is retained from the time it is obtained to the time of sale or other disposition and its stage of development at the time.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The principles set forth in (a) above are not hard and fast rules but must be applied in the total fact situation to aid in determining the actual purpose and result of the activities engaged in by the employees. The following examples will serve to illustrate the application of these principles. Where plants are received in a state of substantial maturity and are merely potted and preserved for a short period of time prior to sale or other disposition, the activities of employees engaged in caring for such plants would not be considered &quot;cultivation&quot; or &quot;growing&quot; within the primary definition of agriculture. This would be the case where substantially mature trees and shrubs from other nurseries are planted or &quot;healed in&quot; for later use in landscaping operations. On the other hand, where rooted cuttings or young plants are received and require substantial growth to reach maturity and where a root system must be developed and regular and intensive care such as spraying, watering, and fertilizing must be performed, the activities of employees performing such operations will be considered as &quot;cultivation&quot; or &quot;growing&quot; within the definition. (See also IB 780.205-.209.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>20b06 - Christmas trees. </strong></p>
<p>Christmas trees, whether wild or planted, are not &quot;agricultural or horticultural commodities&quot; as these terms are used in Sec 3(f) (see IB 780.115.). Consequently the planting, tending, cutting, and trimming of Christmas trees does not constitute &quot;primary agriculture&quot; (see IB 780.208). Activities in connection with Christmas trees may be considered &quot;secondary agriculture&quot;, however. (See IB 780-.203.) The possibility of exemption under Sec 13(b)(28) should not be overlooked (see IB 788 and FOH 25e).</p>
<p><strong>20b07 - Pine straw.</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Pine straw is the fresh, undecomposed pine needles that have fallen from pine trees. It is produced commercially and collected for use as a mulch and groundcover. The raking, gathering, baling and loading of pine straw for commercial purposes is usually performed in pine stands or plantations, from pine trees being grown for forestry and lumbering operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on the plain language of the statute, forestry and lumbering operations are not considered primary agriculture.</p></li>
<li><p>Pine straw activities generally will not qualify as secondary agriculture, unless all the activities are performed by a farmer or on a farm in conjunction with the other farming operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Since pine straw activities typically do not qualify as primary or secondary agriculture, the minimum wage and overtime pay protections of the FLSA will apply to most pine straw workers.</p></li>
<li><p>Section 13(b)(28) exempts from overtime pay “any employee employed in planting or tending trees, cruising, surveying, or felling timber, or in preparing or transporting logs or other forestry products to the mill, processing plant, railroad, or other transportation terminal, if the number of employees employed by his employer in such forestry or lumbering operations does not exceed eight.” Pine straw workers are typically employed in the forestry or lumbering operations described in this exemption because pine straw is a natural substance of trees and therefore a “forestry product.” See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/213'>29 USC 213(b)(28)</a>. Pine straw workers will therefore qualify for the Section 13(b)(28) exemption when the employer employs eight or fewer pine straw workers.</p></li>
<li><p>The FLSA agricultural child labor standards, allowing pine straw workers under the age of 16 to perform all pine straw activities except operating and assisting in operation of a forklift, would generally only apply to pine straw activities if they qualified as secondary agriculture. The FLSA child labor provisions for nonagricultural work prohibit pine straw workers under the age of 16 from employment in pine straw activities and prohibit those who are 16 and 17 years old from operating or assisting in the operation of power-driven hoisting devices, such as forklifts, backhoes, and skid steer loaders.</p></li>
<li><p>Since pine straw activities generally do not qualify as agriculture under the FLSA, employers may continue to utilize the H-2B temporary worker program as opposed to the H-2A temporary worker program.</p></li>
<li><p>See FOH 57k for the application of MSPA to pine straw workers and FOH 36b07 for the application of the OSH Act Field Sanitation Standards to pine straw workers.</p></li>

<h3 id="c---outside-buyer-of-poultry-eggs-cream-or-milk---flsa-sec-13b5-1">20c - OUTSIDE BUYER OF POULTRY, EGGS, CREAM, OR MILK - FLSA SEC 13(b)(5)</h3>
<p><strong>20c00 - General provisions of Sec 13(b)(5) exemption. </strong></p>
<p>Sec 13(b)(5) provides that the OT provisions of the FLSA shall not apply to any individual employed as an outside buyer of poultry, eggs, cream, or milk in their raw or natural state.</p>
<p><strong>20c01 - Meaning of term &quot;outside buyer&quot;. </strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The term &quot;outside buyer&quot; as used in Sec 13(b)(5) refers only to employees who are engaged in buying or contracting to buy, and who are regularly performing these functions away from their employer’s place of business. The term does not include buyers who are located and perform their work in fixed establishments, usually known as buying stations, which are located in the country or in small rural communities away from the main plant where the goods are processed. Sec 13(b)(5) describes an occupation, rather than specific operations, as the basis of exemption for the employees involved.</p></li>
<li><p>The exemption applies to an employee who has as his or her chief duty or primary function buying, in the sense of obtaining and soliciting commitments from the persons on whom he calls, to sell the named commodities. Such an employee will be exempt even though in the course of his duties he spends substantial portions of his time in such work as driving over fixed routes and calling on established customers to pick up the commodities, delivering them to the company plant, returning the empty containers and delivering payment checks, and other work incidental to his occupation as an outside buyer. On the other hand, a routeman who merely trucks commodities is not within the exemption.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>20c02 - Performance of work not within the exemption.</strong></p>
<p>For enforcement purpose, an outside buyer will be considered exempt even though he spends 20% or less of his time in the w/w in nonexempt activities.</p>
<p><strong>20c03 - &quot;Promotional work&quot; by an outside buyer of poultry. eggs, cream, or milk. </strong></p>
<p>Promotional work with farmers, designed to increase the amount of poultry, eggs, cream, or milk purchased in their raw or natural state by an outside buyer, is work characteristic of the occupation or an individual employed as an outside buyer of such products, and would not serve to defeat the exemption. Such promotional work is different from work foreign to the occupation, as for example the picking up of supplies bought by the employer, or the performance of productive work on the products purchased (other than their incidental delivery to the employer when purchased). These latter activities are not within the occupation of &quot;outside buyer&quot;, and will defeat the exemption.</p>

<li><p>The Regs specify that the distances involved in the area of production definition shall be airline distances.

On a comparatively straight road the odometer reading on an automobile may be used, or the distance may be determined by the scale of miles on a map.</p></li>
<li><p>Measurements for distances shall be made from the nearest boundaries of the premises on which the establishments in question are located, the nearest boundaries of the farm or farms, and the nearest boundaries of the city, town, or village to be considered.

<p><strong>20j00 - Enforcement policy for computing BW when the employer is subject to Sec 7(m), 13(h), (i), and (j) exemptions. </strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>When an employer has failed to pay OT specifically required by Sec 7(a) but could have properly applied any of the above exemptions to the period when no OT was paid, care must be taken in determining the extent of liability to assure that he/she is not given an advantage in applying the exemption retroactively that would not have been available to an employer who conscientiously applied the exemption each week as he/she went along. For this reason, WH will be guided by the following in enforcing the Act:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If the employer has available during a particular investigation period year any of the exemptions, but has failed to post the required notice of exemption and has failed to keep the records as required in Reg 516, Subpart B, it will be assumed that he has claimed as exempt weeks the first 14 weeks in the year in which the establishment engaged in operations subject to the exemption and in which the employer did not pay OT compensation for hours over 40 in a week. If in any of these first 14 weeks of OT any employee has worked in excess of 10 hours a day or 48 hours in week, without receiving OT pay, BW shall be sought in these weeks for the employee for hours in excess of 10 or 48 in those weeks. Such weeks will be counted as weeks of exemption. Of course, when the exempt weeks are used up, OT is due for hours worked in excess of 40 in all remaining weeks in the calendar year. (See also FOH 32a01.)</p></li>
<li><p>The calendar year (or period of 52 consecutive weeks) is used in determining the weeks of exemption irrespective of the fact that some part of a calendar year (or period) may fall outside a 2-year investigation period. While the Statute of Limitations may preclude a request for BW for more than a 2-year period of time, it has no application insofar as the selection of the exempt w/w’s is concerned. Thus, if a 2-year investigation period started in the latter part of the calendar year or period, it is possible that all (or some) of the weeks of exemption for that year or period were used up before the investigation period started, and no more weeks (or fewer than the specified number of weeks) are available for the balance of that year or period.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The policy regarding BW contained in FOH 32a01(b) is also applicable to Secs 7(m), 13(h), (i), and (j).</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>20j01 - Selection of weeks. </strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The choice of the fourteen weeks is a matter that is within the discretion of the employer. Exemption may be taken, however, only for such w/w’s during which the operations specified in the Act are carried on and only for those employees who worked not more than 10 hours in a day or 48 hours in a week, or were compensated at time and one half their regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of 10 a day or 48 a week.</p></li>
<li><p>The exempt weeks need not run consecutively. The decision as to each w/w during which the establishment operated under the exemptions may be made at the end of the w/w, the employees being paid accordingly, the nature of the exemption taken being recorded on the payroll, and a notice thereof being posted in accordance with Reg 516.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>20j02 - Application of exemption when same employer operates more than one establishment. </strong></p>
<p>The weeks taken under these exemptions are applicable on an establishment basis, and an employee may be subject to an exemption in each establishment in which he works, even though the establishments are operated by a single employer.</p>
<h4 id="j03---exempt-ww-overlapping-end-of-old-and-beginning-of-new-year.-1">20j03 - Exempt w/w overlapping end of old and beginning of new year. </h4>
<p>If the w/w overlaps the end of the old year and the beginning of the new year, the employer may charge the week against the quota under either year; that is, it may be charged against the old year if he has unused exempt weeks remaining from that year, but it must be charged against the new year’s quota if he has exhausted exempt weeks in the old year.</p>
<p><strong>20j04 - OT standard. </strong></p>
<p>Since these are exemptions from Sec 7(a), neither can be operative with respect to any employee in a w/w when he does not work hours in excess of those specified in Sec 7(a). If an employer can qualify for one of these exemptions he need not pay daily OT for hours in excess of 10 in a day when no Sec 7(a) weekly OT is worked by the employee. If an employee works two 14-hour days in a particular w/w (28 hours total for the w/w) no OT compensation is due as he has not exceeded the 40-hour weekly OT standard. But if an employee engaged in exempt operations worked three 14-hour days in a selected w/w (42 hours total for the w/w), payment of OT compensation would be due for 12 hours.</p>

<li><p>An employer’s use of the Sec 13(h) exemption for a particular group of employees precludes use of any other exemption under Secs 7 or 13 for those employees. Such use, however, does not prohibit utilizing Secs 13(i) or 13(j) for certain other employees simply because Sec 13(h) is used. Thus, for example, if an employer claims Sec 13(h) for certain employees in the establishment, he or she cannot claim other Sec 7 or Sec 13 exemptions for them, but can utilize Secs 13(a)(1), 13(i), or 13(j) for non-Sec 13(h) activities by other employees.</p></li>
<li><p>The statutory wording &quot;necessary and incidental&quot; in Sec 13(h) is not analogous in scope to that of &quot;engaged in&quot; in Secs 13(i) and 13(j) and shall not be interpreted to have the same meaning and effect. For example, employers whose employees actually perform the operations described in Sec 13(i) or 13(j) may claim the exemption for those so engaged. Employers whose employees are engaged in occupations &quot;necessary and incidental&quot; to work performed pursuant to Sec 13(i) or 13(j), who work exclusively in such operations and who work solely in those portions of the premises devoted by their employer to such operations, may claim exemption(s) provided by Sec 13(h).</p></li>
<li><p>Sec 13(h) is more narrow in its application than the expired Secs 7(c) and 7(d) with respect to the cotton storing and compressing and cottonseed processing industries. Pursuant to Reg 526.10(b)(8) and 526.11(b)(1), old Secs 7(c) and 7(d) exempted entire industries, whereas Secs 13(h)(1)(B) and 13(h)(1)(C) exempt only individual employees. Sec 13(h) requires that employees be &quot;exclusively&quot; involved in specified activities (thus permitting no tolerances).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Sec 13(h) provides an exemption for employees performing auxiliary services (services that are &quot;necessary and incidental&quot; to the named operations) which are not exempt under Secs 13(i) and 13(j). It also replaces Secs 7(c) and/or (d) with respect to the operations named in Sec 13(h) which were previously exempted under Secs 7(c) and/or 7(d). For example employees not actually engaged in ginning cotton (see IB 780.810) or processing sugar beets, sugar beet molasses, or sugar cane into sugar (see IB 780.818) may be eligible for the exemption provided by this Sec.</p></li>
