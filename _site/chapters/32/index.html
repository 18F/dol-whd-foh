              <h3>32a01  Application of partial OT exemptions.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Notwithstanding IB 778.603, where
OT has not been paid for hours worked in excess of the statutory w/w standard,
BW are owed to the employee only for the hours worked in excess of the
statutory standard ( e.g., 48, 46, 44) in the following exemptions:</p><p>Sec
13(b)(4) - Fish processing</p><p>Sec
13(b)(7) - Local transit</p><p>Sec
13(b)(8) - Restaurant and hotel</p><p>Sec
13(b)(18) - Food service</p><p>Sec
13(b)(19) - Bowling alley</p><p>Sec
13(b)(23) - Telegraph</p><p>(b)  
BW will be based, with appropriate
modifications, on the enforcement policy in FOH 20i09 in the following
exemptions:</p><p>Sec
7(m) - Tobacco :(see also FOH 20t01(c).)</p><p>Sec
7(c) and 7(d) - Seasonal industries</p><p>Sec
13(b)(25) - Cotton</p><p>Sec
13(b)(26) – Sugar</p><p>Sec
13(h) - Cotton, Cottonseed and Sugar</p><p>(c)  
If OT has not been paid for hours
over 8 or 80, as required by Sec 7(j), BW are owed for hours worked over these
standards. However, if there is no prior agreement (see FOH 25h02) to utilize
7(j), BW are due for hours over 40 a week.</p><p>(d)  
The policy in FOH 25c01 will be
followed for BW if the conditions in Sec 7(b)(3) are not met.</p><p>(e)  
If no work period is designated or
otherwise objectively established for purposes of Sec 7(k), as for example by
employee agreement or established practice, BW are owed for hours over 40 a
week. However, if the preconditions are met, BW are owed for hours worked in
excess of the work period standard.</p>

pay or only partial payment.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
The regular rate for purposes of
BW computations for OT weeks in which an employee subject to the OT provisions
of the Acts receive no pay or only part of his pay shall be determined on the
basis of the established practice, agreement, or understanding. In the case of
an employee paid solely on the basis of an hourly rate, this hourly rate shall
be the regular rate for purposes of computations during such weeks. Similarly,
where it is determined that the practice or agreement by which an employee’ s
wages are computed is, for example, an established weekly salary, piece rate or
day rate, such salary, piece rate or day rate shall be used to compute the
regular rate. The following examples illustrate the application of this
principle:</p><p>(1)  An employee works a total of 48 hours in a particular
week and receives no pay for that w/w. He regularly receives a weekly salary of
$96 as ST payment for all hours in a week. For the w/w in question the
employee’s regular rate would be $2 an hour ($96 divided by 48 hours). He would
be due $2 an hour for the first 40 hours and $3 an hour for each hour over 40
or a total of $104 for the week.</p><p>(2)  An employee is paid $1.90 per hour and has 38 recorded
hours and has received $72.20 but has actually worked 44 hours. He would be due
$1.90 for the 39th hour, $1.90 for the 40th hour, and $2.85 for each additional
hour.</p><p>(b)  
If the regular rate cannot be
determined as in (a) above, or if the regular rate so determined is less than
the legal minimum, the regular rate for OT purposes shall be the legal minimum
(see FOH 32j01 and 32j02).</p>

              <p>When
an employee is employed on a piece rate basis, his regular hourly rate of pay
is computed by adding together his total weekly earnings from piece rates and
all other sources (such as production bonuses) and any sums paid for waiting
time or other hours worked (except statutory exclusions). This sum is then
divided by the number of hours worked in the week to yield the pieceworker’s
“regular rate” for that week. In some cases, the pieceworker is hired on a
piece rate basis with a minimum hourly guarantee. Where the total piece rate
earnings for the week fall short of the amount that would be earned for the
total hours at the guaranteed rate, the employee is paid the difference. In
those weeks in which the “make-up” payment is made, the employee is in fact
paid at an hourly rate and the minimum hourly guaranty which he was paid is his
regular rate for that week.</p>

without regard to the number of hours worked in the day or at the job, and if

              <p>(a)  
If an employee is given a
stipulated salary with the understanding that it constitutes straight time pay
for all hours he works, and if his hours of work fluctuate from week to week,
his regular rate of pay ordinarily will vary from week to week in accordance
with the number of hours worked each week. The regular rate, of course, cannot
be less than the applicable MW. Since straight time compensation has already
been paid, such an employee must receive additional OT compensation for each OT
hour in a particular w/w computed at not less than one-half the regular rate
obtained by dividing the weekly salary by the number of hours worked in that
w/w. If the employer to avoid weekly computations chooses to pay extra
half-time based on the salary divided by 40 hours, such a method is
permissible.</p><p>(b)  
The above rule will apply where an
employee works a varying number of hours, and normally receives his full salary
regardless of how few the scheduled hours may be in a particular week, even
though occasional disciplinary deductions for willful absence or tardiness are
made. Disciplinary deductions of course, may not cut into the MW or OT pay
required by the Act.</p><p>(c)  
Similarly, an employee employed on
a fixed salary basis for irregular hours of work may be paid a pro rata share
of his salary in the initial or terminal week of his employment, when he is not
in payroll status for the entire week.</p>

              <p>Certain
employment such as that in schools does not normally constitute 12 months of
work each year. For the convenience of the employee, the annual salary earned
during the duty months is often paid in equal monthly installments throughout
the entire year. For purposes of finding the regular rate of pay for OT purpose
in such cases, the annual salary is considered in relation to the duty month
rather than in relation to the entire year. Thus, for example, a school bus
driver may receive an annual salary of $3000 for 10 months duty but be paid
equal monthly installments of $250 each. In such a case, he is considered as
being paid at the salary rate of $300 per month or $69.23 per week. The regular
rate for OT purposes is found in the usual manner based on this weekly salary.

specified types of payments including certain bonuses. (For a discussion of

              <h3>32c03         How a bonus is to be included in the regular rate.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
If a bonus covers only one weekly
pay period, the amount of the bonus is merely added to the other earnings of
the employee (except statutory exclusions) and the total divided by the total
hours worked by the employee.</p><p>(b)  
Where the calculation of a bonus
is deferred over a period of time longer than one workweek, the employer may
disregard the bonus in computing the regular hourly rate until the amount of
the bonus can be ascertained.  At the time the amount of the bonus is
ascertained, it must be apportioned back over the workweeks of the period
during which it may be said to have been earned, so that the employee will
receive an additional amount of compensation for each week in which he worked
OT during the period. This additional amount will be based on one-half the
hourly rate of pay allocable to the bonus for that week multiplied by the
number of OT hours worked during the week</p><p>(c)  
If it is impractical to allocate
the bonus among the workweeks of the period in proportion to the amount of the
bonus actually earned each week, some other reasonable and equitable method of
allocation should be adopted. For example, it may be assumed that the employee
earned an equal amount of bonus each hour worked in the bonus period. The
hourly increase is then determined by dividing the total bonus by the number of
hours worked by the employee du ring the period for which it is paid.</p>

              <h3>32c04  Distribution of bonuses as a percentage of total earnings or by
the boosted hour method.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Whether a bonus may be distributed
as a percentage of total earnings of each participating employee or by the
boosted hour method to achieve compliance with the OT provisions of the FLSA or
PCA, depends on whether the additional money to be paid is a true bonus or
whether it is a device to evade the payment of OT. If the so-called “regular
rate” of the employee is so low as to be obviously fictitious, the “bonus” in
all probability will be a part of the regular straight-time earnings upon which
OT compensation must be computed. On the other hand, if the additional money to
be paid is a true bonus, it may be distributed in proportion to the total
earnings (exclusive of the bonus) of each participating employee properly
computed to include time and one-half for the OT hours or in proportion to the
boosted hours worked during the bonus period.</p><p>(b)  
Extra payments not directly
related to hours worked, production, or efficiency, such as profit-sharing type
bonuses and year-end or Christmas bonuses which fail to meet the tests for
exclusion from the regular rate of pay under FLSA Sec 7 will generally be found
to be true bonuses. Production bonuses and labor saving bonuses present a more
difficult problem. For investigation purposes, if the Inv finds that such
additional payments periodically made are not merely devices for the postponement
of the full payment to the employees of their ordinary wage or salary or
devices for the perpetuation of an obsolete pay structure, he will be justified
in concluding that the payments are true bonuses. In this event, such payments
could be made as a percentage of total earnings or by the boosted hour method.
Evidence that the payment is not being used for evasive purposes may be found
in the fact that the wages otherwise paid to the employees are fair and not out
of line with wages which might ordinarily be expected to be paid for the
occupation in the locality. The determination should be based on the actual or
potential operation of the bonus plan during a reasonably extended series for
pay periods.</p><p>(c)  
Many employers distribute bonuses
on the basis of total straight time hours or earn­ings. If an investigation
discloses that a bonus has been distributed in this manner and OT has been
worked, the investigation will be handled as follows:</p><p>(1)  If the bonus is of the type not directly related to
hours worked, production or efficiency but which for some reason fails to
qualify for exclusion from the regular rate under Sec 7(e), no request for back
wages shall be made. In such cases the employer shall be informed of possible
Sec 16(b) liability and of the steps necessary to effect compliance. The number
of employees and the estimated amount of back wages shall not be shown on Form
WH-51. The narrative shall contain a concise statement of the facts. Where an
employee involved in such bonus payments is due back wages arising from other
causes, the payment of such of other back wages will be requested and
supervised.</p><p>(2)  If the bonus is a production bonus, a cost of living
bonus or any other bonus directly related to hours worked, production or
efficiency, OT violations will be recorded and the employer will be requested
to pay the back wages.</p><p>(3)  In the case of either (1) or (2) above, it must be
kept in mind that the payments may be excludable under the provisions of FLSA
Sec 7(g)(3) - Reg 548.</p>

              <h3>32c05c Distribution according to length of service and similar factors.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Distribution of a total bonus may
also take into account such factors as length of service, attendance lateness,
production, efficiency, place of employment, job classifications, and the like.
For example, the gross earnings of each participating employee may be weighted
by multiplying them by a length of service factor such as 1.0 for one year, 1.1
for two years, 1.2 for three years, and so on. A total bonus can then be
distributed on a percentage basis to each individual member sharing in the
bonus by dividing the total weighted payroll of the participating employees
into the total bonus. If each participating employee is then paid as his share
this percentage of his total weighted earnings for the bonus period, the bonus
mathematically will include both straight-time and OT and the payment will be in
compliance with the FLSA and PCA. Such a bonus distribution may be based on
more than one such factor by multiplying the gross earning of each employee by
the additional factors and then determining each employee’s share as above.</p><p>(b)  
The weighting of employees’ gross
earnings to take into account length of service and similar factors is not
invalid provided it is not designed to circumvent the OT requirements of the
FLSA or PCA. It would, for example, be improper to apply a factor that decreases
in inverse proportion to the OT worked by various groups of employees. A
“group” to which a particular factor is to be applied may happen to include
only one employee and still be valid. However, it should be clear that the
dollar amount of the employee’s share of the total bonus has not been
determined before establishment of the value of the length of service or other
factor that is applied to his gross earnings. If the gross earnings of each of
the participating employees is weighted by a factor of different value, there
would be some evidence that the values of the factors had not been
predetermined. In any instance where there is a question. the Inv shall discuss
his findings with his FOS.</p>

              <h3>32f01   Effect of regular practice where agreement does not specifically
designate an hours standard workday.</h3>
              <p>The
fact that a collective bargaining or employment agreement does not specify the
exact hours that are to constitute the workday does not preclude application of
FLSA Sec 7(e)(7), nor is it necessary that the contract or agreement
specifically provide for premium pay for hours “outside the workday”. If in
practice the parties have arranged for payment of not less than time and
one-half a bona fide rate for hours outside of a workday, the practice will be
deemed to modify the terms of the original contract or agreement . For example,
if a contract provides for payment of time and one-half for hours beyond 8 in a
day or 40 in a week, but in practice the employees normally work from 8 a. m.
to 5 p.m. with 1 hour for lunch, the payment of time and one-half for the hours
before 8 a.m. and after 5 p.m. will be accepted as compliance with FLSA Sec
7(e)(7). Furthermore, where the scheduled hours of the workday vary from time
to time because of unforeseen contingencies, this fact does not preclude the
acceptance of such a workday as an established workday under Sec 7(e)(7). Where
the above conditions are met, the OT premiums are valid under Sec 7(e)(7)
regardless of the number of hours during the basic, normal workday or workweek.</p>

              <p>(a)  
Employers should be encouraged to
reduce FLSA Sec 7(f) contracts to writing, since a contract of this nature is
complicated and proof both of its existence and of its compliance with the
requirement of Sec 7(f) may be difficult if it is an oral contract. It should
be kept in mind that Reg 516.24(c) requires, in the case of an oral agreement,
that a written memorandum summarizing the terms of the 7(f) agreement be made
by the employer. Failure to maintain such a written memorandum would result in
a recordkeeping violation but would not of itself invalidate an otherwise valid
7(f) contract or agreement. It may, however, in conjunction with other factors
point toward either the invalidity or nonexistence of such an agreement.</p><p>(b)  
A contract cannot be a one-sided
affair. Therefore, the employee must not only be aware of, but must have agreed
to, the method of compensation in advance of his performance of the work.</p><p>(c)  
The contract whether oral or
written must provide for compliance with all of the requirements of FLSA Sec
7(f), and where there is a change in the specified rate or the number of hours
for which pay is guaranteed, the contract must be amended accordingly.</p>

              <h3>32g02  Irregular hours.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Contracts under FLSA Sec 7(f) may
be made only with, or by their representatives on behalf of, employees whose
duties necessitate irregular hours of work. In this connection, there is
nothing in the FLSA which makes the Sec 7(f) exemption inapplicable to any
class of employees. Whether or not the duties of employees necessitate
irregular hours of work must be decided on the facts of employment as to such
employees.</p><p>(b)  
The following situations do not
permit a finding that the employee’s hours are in fact irregular:</p><p>(1)  The fluctuation results entirely from absences of the
employee for reasons other than the nature of his duties, such as absences due
to illness, vacation, holidays, and the like.</p><p>(2)  The fluctuation results because the employee works
fixed workweeks of different lengths. This would include situations where the
fixed workweeks of longer length occur during seasonal peaks.</p><p>(3)  The only fluctuation is minor or insignificant. The
terms minor and insignificant shall be understood to mean fluctuations of 4 or
less hours between the lowest number of hours worked and the highest number of
hours worked in any year or where the fluctuations, even though beyond this
range are only occasional.</p><p>(4)  The fluctuation, (even though more than occasional,
minor or insignificant) occurs exclusively or nearly so in the hours above the
applicable statutory OT standard.</p><p>(c)  
Where irregular hours are worked
during most of the contract period, the irregular hours of work criterion will
be met even though there are periods in which regular hours are worked.
Likewise, where irregular hours are worked during the entire period, a single
Sec 7(f) contract or agreement covering the entire period may be proper even
though hours fluctuated at a low level during the slack season and at a high
level during the busy season. In the latter case, it is possible also to have
two Sec 7(f) contracts, one for the busy season and one for the slack season. A
further discussion with reference to irregular hours is contained in IB
778.405.</p>

In the case of a group of
employees similarly situated with respect to the kind or nature of the work
they do, a contract may be set up with the same provisions for all individuals
in the group.</p><p>(b)  
In determining the validity of the
agreement with respect to any individual employee in a group, the experience of
the group as a whole should be considered together with the experience of the
individual employee. Where the experience of the individual is found to meet
all the tests of a valid Sec 7(f) contract, the contract will be considered
valid for him. However, the fact that an individual, who is a member of a group
failed for a particular period to work hours which in fact are irregular does
not necessarily invalidate his contract if it can be concluded that, on the
basis of the experience of the group, it can be “reasonably expected” that he
will meet this test.</p>

              <p>(a)  
To meet the requirement. for the
payment of not less than time and one-half for hours over the applicable
statutory OT standard in the workweek, the employee must be paid the full
amount of the guaranty (except as provided in (b) below) for every workweek,
however short, in which he performs any amount of work for the employer. In
addition, the employee must be paid time and one-half the specified rate for
all hours actually worked in excess of the number of hours covered by the
guaranty. As a general rule, failure to pay such additional OT for excess hours
will preclude the application of FLSA Sec 7(f).</p><p>(b)  
The following types of deductions
may be made without affecting the validity of a Sec. 7(f) plan. In each case,
however, it will be necessary to review the circumstances carefully.</p><p>(1)  Deductions to cover the cost to the employer of
furnishing board, lodging, and other facilities within the meaning of FLSA Sec
3(m).</p><p>(2)  Deductions authorized by the employee, such as union

              <h3>32g05  Regular rate in relation to guaranty - “excessivity” standard not
controlling.</h3>
              <p>As
a result of judicial decisions, the failure of the pay arrangement to meet the
“excessivity” standard referred to in IB 778.408 and 778.410-.414 is no longer considered
sufficient in itself to be a controlling criterion in testing the validity of a
Sec 7(f) contract. In substance, the “excessivity” standard contemplated that
the relationship between the hourly rate specified in the contract and the
amount of the guaranty must be such that the employee would have worked or
could reasonably have been expected to work sufficient hours to earn in excess
of the guaranty in a significant number of weeks and thus demonstrate that the
regular rate was designed to be operative in controlling the compensation. The
weight to be given to a failure to meet this standard will depend on all the
facts and the total situation. While the courts have declined to accept the
view that validity of a pay arrangement under Sec 7(f) may be tested by this
standard alone, the factors involved still may have evidential bearing, at
least in conjunction with other pertinent considerations, on the bona fides of
the contract. In situations where the fluctuations in weekly hours seem plainly
unrelated to the guaranteed contract hours (for example, the employee’s hours
ordinarily fluctuate between 35 and 45 or 50 but the contract guaranty covers
60 hours), the bona fides of the contract are subject to doubt . It is unlikely
that under a bona fide contract an employer will pay week after week for more
hours than actually worked.</p>

The guaranty must be a weekly
guaranty. A guaranty of monthly, semimonthly, or biweekly pay does not qualify
under FLSA Sec 7(f). However, the weekly guarantee may be paid every 2 weeks,
or at the end of a semimonthly or monthly pay period for all workweeks ending
within the pay period. (See FOH 32j11.)</p><p>(b)  
The contract must provide a
guaranty of pay, and the amount must be specified. A mere guaranty to provide
work for a particular number of hours is not sufficient. The pay guaranteed
must be for not more than 60 hours based on specified rates.</p>

              <p>(a)  
Where it is found that a
guaranteed weekly wage plan does not meet the requirements of FLSA Sec 7(f)
during a particular period of time for a particular employee, a violation will
exist for that employee and the total amount of his guaranteed wage as
specified in the contract or agreement determines his regular rate of pay
during the period of violation. In any week in the violation period for which
it is necessary to compute his regular rate of pay for OT purposes, the rate
shall be determined as follows:</p><p>(1)  In workweeks not exceeding the guaranteed number of
hours, the total amount of the guaranty shall be divided by the number of hours
actually worked.</p><p>(2)  In workweeks exceeding the number of hours covered by
the guaranty, the guaranteed salary shall be divided by the guaranteed number
of hours. Compensation received by the employee for work in excess of the
guaranty may, of course, be offset against the amount found due by computing
his earnings on the regular rate of pay calculated as explained above.</p><p>(b)  
Illustration:</p><p>A
Sec 7(f) plan has been determined to be invalid for a particular employee. The
rate specified in the contract or agreement is $4.00 per hour and a guaranty of
$220.00 to cover ST and OT compensation for 50 hours is provided. No bonuses or
other additions to wages are paid to the employee.</p><p>(1)  In a week in which he worked 45 hours the employee’s
regular rate of pay would be $220.00 divided by 45 hours, or $4.88. In addition
to the $220.00 already paid to him under his guaranty, he would be entitled to
receive half-time for the five OT hours, or $12.20.</p><p>(2)  In a week in which the employee worked 50 hours, the
number of hours for which pay was guaranteed, his regular rate would be $220.00
divided by 50 hours, or $4.40. He would be entitled to receive an additional
$22.00 for the 10 OT hours.</p><p>(3)  In a week in which the employee worked 55 hours and
received under his contract or agreement the total amount of $250.00 ($220.00
under his guaranty and $20.00 as ST pay and $10.00 as OT premium for the five
additional hours) his regular rate of pay would still be determined by dividing
the amount of his guaranty, $220.00 by the number of hours for which pay was
guaranteed, 50 hours. His regular rate for that week would thus again be $4.40
and total compensation due would be ($220.00 + $22.00) + (5 X 1-1/2 X $4.40) or
$275.00. BW due would be $275.00 - $250.00 or $25.00.</p><p>(c)

use of the coefficient table as appropriate. (See “Transcription and

778.418(a)(4) and 778.419(a) (3) provide that a piece rate or hourly rate will
be regarded as a ‘bona fide” rate for OT purposes if it meets the MW
requirements and is the rate “actually paid” for the particular kind of work
during nonovertime hours. However, situations may arise where the particular
kind of work for which the rate has been established is performed only during
OT hours. In such cases, and if the MW requirement is met, the rate established
for this work will be considered bona fide for OT purposes provided it is the
rate which would be paid for the particular kind of work should it be performed
during nonovertime hours. For example, a rate of $2 an hour (which is equal to
or in excess of the rate normally paid) may be established for janitorial work
in a welding shop under an arrangement whereby the work will be done by certain
of the shop welders, whose welding rate is $3 an hour. (The prior understanding
of the parties is that this different kind of work will be performed by the
welders at the $2 rate and OT paid at 1½ the rate which is applicable to the
work performed during OT hours.) If the circumstances are such that the welders
perform the janitorial work only in their OT hour., the $2 rate shall be
considered a bona fide rate for OT purposes provided it is the rate which would
have been paid to the welders had they performed the janitorial work in
nonovertime hours. The fact that the janitorial rate in this instance is 2/3 of
the welding rate (thus making the time and one-half OT rate for janitorial work
equal to the straight time rate for welding work) is not material so long as
the janitorial rate is a bona fide rate.</p>

the employee’s regular wages may not be excluded.</p><p>(b)  
As a general rule, payments which
are regularly paid on every payday are not excludable as they are not “additional”,
but an integral part of the employee’s regular wages. Furthermore, the mere
fact that payments are deferred to a future time will not make them excludable
as additional payments if they amount to nothing more than an increase in the
rate per hour or per piece. An exception is made for payments in kind and
certain cash payments, such as Social Security taxes which are excludable even
if paid every payday.</p><p>(c)  
An “additional” payment within the
meaning of the Reg generally is one which is made on a different basis from
that which determines the wages to which the employee is regularly entitled and
is not regularly made every payday.</p><p>(d)  
The following types of payment may
be excluded if the 50 cents condition and the requirements of 548.2 are met:</p><p>(1)  Prizes.</p><p>(2)  Merchandise awards.</p><p>(3)  Housing of nominal value.</p><p>(4)  Lunches.</p><p>(5)  Social Security taxes.</p><p>(6)  Flat sum payments or retroactive rate increase made as

periodically.</p><p>(9)  Individual or group production bonuses which are not
earned every payday and are paid on a basis other than the employee’s regular
wages</p><p>(e)  
The following types of payment are
not excludable even if the other conditions are met:</p><p>(1)  Night shift differentials. </p><p>(2)  Higher rates paid as premium pay for non-OT hours.</p><p>(3)  Rate increases which become effective after a rise in
the cost of living.</p><p>(4)  Commissions and incentive or production bonuses earned

In the case of nonexempt operators
who own and operate their own equipment (trucks, scrapers, mules, horses, etc.)
as employees of the persons or companies for whom they perform the work,
whenever separate rates have not been established for the rental of equipment
and for the labor, or when such separate rates, if made, appear to be
unreasonable or disproportionate, the following rates shall be deemed to have
been paid as wages:</p><p>(1)  the regular hourly rate being paid by the same
employer to operators of similar company- owned equipment, or</p><p>(2)  where the regular hourly rate noted in the foregoing
clause (1) is not available the rate usually paid in the area to operators of
similar company-owned equipment, or</p><p>(3)  when rates noted in foregoing clauses (1) or (2) are
not available, a percentage formula such as 80% rent and 20% wages, or 75%-25%
or some similar formula should be used. When it is necessary to use a formula
of this type, one should be selected which will result in a reasonable relation
between the cost of renting equipment and the wages paid to operators.</p><p>(b)  
Wherever possible, clause (1)
above shall be followed. Clause (2) shall be followed only when clause (1)
cannot be used, and clause (3) shall be used only as a last resort.</p><p>(c)  
In order to be in compliance in
the future, particularly as to the record-keeping regulations, employers shall
be required to break down the compensation paid into labor rates and equipment
rental. By agreement with the employees involved, separate rates shall be
established for the rental of the equipment and for the labor.</p><p>(d)  
The separate rates for labor and
equipment rentals thus established, wherever they appear unreasonable or
disproportionate, shall be scrutinized for possible evasion of the OT
requirements of the FLSA or PCA. Such evasions might be evident, for example,
if the rates set up for labor of an owner-operator are grossly out-of-line with
the rate paid by the same employer to operators of similar company-owned
equipment or with the prevailing rate in the area for such operators. It may be
found that in breaking down the rates which covered both the equipment and
labor, the employer has allocated an unreasonable or disproportionate part of
the rate to the equipment rental with the intent of diminishing the regular
rate of pay on which OT has to be computed.</p><p>(e)  
The half time OT premium on a

Permanent reduction.</p><p>(1)  A permanent reduction in a fixed schedule of workweek
hours without a reduction in the salary or take-home pay results in an
increased regular rate. Where the employer has continued to use the original
rate in computing OT, a violation shall be charged. However, where such a
violation resulted from a genuine misunderstanding of the OT requirements, no
request for payment of back wages shall be made. The employees involved and the
amount of beck wages shall not be reported on Form WH-51. A brief explanation shall
be made in the narrative. The employer shall be advised of the rights of
employees under Sec 16(b).</p><p>(2)  The following conditions will be indicative of a
genuine misunderstanding:</p><p>a.    
It is clear that there was
compliance before the change, that is, the rates then used for straight time
and OT purposes were bona fide and properly paid; and</p><p>b.    
the reduction in hours without a
reduction in take-home pay was intended to and did benefit the employees; and</p><p>c.    
there was no intention to evade
the payment of the OT premium required by the Act.</p><p>(3)  The employer shall be advised that the payment of the
same take-home pay for the reduced workweek establishes an increased regular
rate of pay which must be used to compute OT compensation for all statutory OT
hours.</p><p>(b)  
<b>Temporary or
seasonal-reduction.</b></p><p>(1)  As a general rule, a reduction in a fixed schedule of
workweek hours without reduction in salary or take-home pay for all weeks of a
specified period of definite and reasonably long duration, such as a seasonal
slack period, will result in an increased regular rate, as in the case of a
permanent reduction. The policy set forth in (a) above will be followed as to
the requirements for future compliance and in making the determination as to
whether to request payment of back wages in such cases.</p><p>(2)  Where employees are given time off on a temporary
basis such as all Saturdays or some part of them in the summer months, or other
bona fide seasonal vacation periods, without reduction of salary or take-home
pay, the time off will be regarded as vacation time within the meaning of Sec
7(e)(2). Thus, the pay for such time off will not affect the regular rate of
pay. Likewise, there would be no violation of the Act if the employer required
the employees to work those hours which were scheduled as vacation time off,
without paying them additional compensation. The same result would follow if a
half day off was given every other Saturday during the period of Daylight
Saving Time.</p><p>(c)  
<b>Permanent schedule of
alternating workweek, of different fixed lengths. </b></p><p>Where
an employer has established a permanent schedule of alternating workweeks of
different fixed lengths he/she may, by agreement or understanding with the
employee, pay the same straight-time compensation for the scheduled hours of
the “long” and “short” workweeks, but he/she may not pay the same fixed salary
for the long and short schedules of hours to cover total compensation including
the </p><p>OT
pay. The payment of the same straight-time compensation for the scheduled long
and short workweeks establishes different rates of pay for the long and short
scheduled workweek. If in such a case the employer has p id the same total
compensation for both the long and short scheduled workweeks the policy
expressed in (a) above will be followed.</p>

understanding between the employer and the employee that a lump-sum payment is
predicated on at least time and one-half tbe established rate, and that OT payment

a violation if it equals or exceeds the proper OT payment due. For example,
during a limited period each year hourly-rated employees worked after regular

If it is not feasible to allocate
the retroactive increases among the workweeks of the period in proportion to
the amount of the increases actually applicable to each week, some other
reasonable and equitable method of allocation must be adopted. For example, it
may be assumed that the employee earned an equal amount of the increase each
hour of the pay period and so the resultant hourly increase may be determined
by dividing the total amount of increase by the number of hours worked by the
employee during the period for which it is paid.</p>

              <h3>32j08   Deductions in overtime weeks.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
(FLSA Sec 7 (a) requires that an
employee receive compensation for OT hours at “a rate not less than one and
one-half times the regular rate at which he/she is employed”. Where board,
lodging, and facilities are charged to the employee and the employer recovers
the amount by deductions from the employee’s cash wages, the regular rate is
determined before the deductions are made. There is no limit to the amount
which may be deducted for these items, provided that the deductions are
confined to the reasonable cost of the board and lodging furnished. Where such
deductions are in amounts which exceed the “reasonable cost”, the excess amount
shall be handled the same as deductions for items other than “board, lodging,
or other facilities”. The term “other facilities” means such items as meals
furnished at company restaurants, housing furnished, general merchandise bought
at company stores (including food, clothing, and household effects), and fuel,
electricity, water, and gas furnished for the personal use of the employee.</p><p>(b)  
Employers must pay
statutorily-required MW and OT premium pay finally and unconditionally, or
“free and clear.” The cost of furnishing items that are primarily for the
benefit or convenience of the employer do not qualify as “facilities” under
FLSA section 3(m); thus they may not be included as part of wages due. 
Further, deductions for articles that do not qualify as “board, lodging, or
other facilities” under FLSA section 3(m), such as tools, equipment, cash
register shortages, and other similar items, may not be made if they cut into
required MW or OT premium pay. Deductions that reduce an employee’s average
hourly earnings for the workweek after the deductions to less than the highest applicable
MW rate are illegal in an OT week unless the law establishing that MW (e.g.,
State law, DBRA, SCA, H-2A, H-1B, H-2B, or a MSPA contracted “promised wage”)
allows the particular deduction. (NOTE: If a MSPA contract specifically
discloses that the employer will make certain particularized deductions not
other prohibited by other law, those deductions would be permitted. For
example, if a MSPA-covered employer disclosed a wage rate of $8.00/hour and
fully disclosed in writing at the time of recruitment that $1.50/hour would be
deducted for non-3(m) items, and the deductions are otherwise legal and not
prohibited by other applicable laws, then those fully-disclosed deductions are
permitted to reduce the hourly wage to below the $8.00/hour contracted “promised
wage” (i.e. to $6.50/hour). Deductions for non-3(m) items may be made in an OT
workweek to the same extent as permitted in a non-OT workweek if their purpose
and effect are not to evade the OT requirements of the FLSA or other law, and
if they are bona fide deductions made for particular items according to a prior
agreement or understanding between the employer and the employee before the
work is performed (Regs 531.37(a) and 778.315).</p><p>(c)  
If an employer and an employee
have an express or implied agreement about a deduction policy for particular
items, then bona fide deductions pursuant to the policy will be allowed during
an OT workweek to the extent that they would be allowed in a non-OT workweek,
provided that the deductions do not violate other applicable laws (e.g., State
law), the employee receives “free and clear” the highest applicable MW
(including prevailing wages) required by any Federal, State or local law for
the non-OT hours, and the employee receives time and one-half the regular rate
of pay based on the stipulated wage, before any deductions are made, for all
the OT hours. For example, if a forestry worker subject to a $9.00 per hour SCA
prevailing WD is paid $10.00 per hour ($1.00 above the legally-required SCA WD
rate of $9.00) and works 50 hours in a particular workweek, the most that may
be deducted from this worker’s wages for that week pursuant to a prior
agreement covering specific deductions (e.g. purchase of a saw) is 40 times
$1.00 ($40.00). (Statutory wages due net after deductions = [40x$9.00 ($360.00
MW]+[(10 x 1.50 x $10.00 ($150.00 OT)] or $510.00 total MW &amp; OT.)</p><p>(d)  
Unless there is an agreement as to
deductions for particular items, or if the employer reduces an employee’s wages
for a reason not addressed in the contractual arrangement or for no legitimate
reason, the deductions will be considered illegal and will not be allowed
during OT workweeks. To determine if these criteria are met, apply the
following standards:</p><p>(1)  Deductions must be made for particular items according
to an agreement or understanding between the parties:  The agreement must be
reached before the employee performs the work that becomes subject to the
deductions. The agreement must be specific concerning the particular items for
which the deductions will be made, and the employee must know how the amount of
the deductions will be determined that are included in the agreement (e.g.,
cash register shortages). The employee must affirmatively agree or assent to
the employer’s deduction policy. While the employee’s assent to the policy may
be written or unwritten, the employer bears the burden of proof that an
employee has agreed to the deduction policy.</p><p>(2)  Only bona fide deductions, made for particular items,
are permitted:  Deductions that are otherwise prohibited by other laws or
authority (Federal, State or local) are not bona fide (e.g., if a State law
prohibits any deductions from employees’ wages for tools and similar items or
equipment that are business expenses of the employer, WH would not allow any
deductions in that State in an OT workweek, regardless of whether the highest
WH-enforced MW was paid (net) after the deductions). Deductions for amounts
above the reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing a particular item to an
employee are also not bona fide (e.g., furnishing items to employees “at a
profit”; deductions for substandard housing). Deductions from wages where no
prior agreement exists as to particular items are never permitted in an OT
workweek.</p><p>(3)  The regular rate of pay is based on the stipulated
wage before any deductions are made:  Deductions for non-3(m) items that reduce
an employee’s rate of pay to below the highest applicable legally-required MW
are illegal unless the law establishing that MW allows the particular
deductions. In OT workweeks (where OT requirements apply), deductions may be
made according to an agreement that reduce the effective hourly rate down to
the highest required MW, but only from the non-OT hours (first 40 hours in the
week). Proper time and one-half the full regular rate (pre-deductions) must be
paid for all statutory OT hours.</p><p>(4)  The purpose and effect of the deductions are not to
evade the OT requirements or other laws: Deductions made only in OT workweeks,
or increases in prices charged during OT workweeks compared to non-OT
workweeks, will be considered manipulations to evade statutory OT requirements
which are prohibited. Deductions that violate other applicable laws are
prohibited in an OT workweek. (See Regs 531.37(a) and 778.315.)</p>

              <h3>32j13   Change of workweek.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
A change of the workweek from one
period of seven consecutive days to another period of seven consecutive days
necessarily creates an overlap between the last workweek in the old schedule
and the first workweek in the new; that is, certain hours fall within both
workweeks.</p><p>(b)  
If the hours which fall within
both workweeks are hours in which the employee does no work, his statutory
compensation for each workweek is, of course, determined as it would be if no
over existed.</p><p>(c)  
If, on the other hand, some of the
employee’s work time falls within hours which are included in both workweeks,
the employee’s straight-time and OT compensation shall be computed by counting
such work time as hours worked in whichever of the two workweeks its inclusion
will yield the higher total compensation for both workweeks. After thus
determining the workweek to which the overlapping work time shall be allocated,
the remaining workweek shall be treated as one in which the only compensable
worktime is that falling exclusively within that workweek and outside the
portion which overlaps the other workweek. Subject to this modification, the
compensation due an employee for straight-time and for overtime on a daily or weekly
basis shall be computed and paid for each workweek as in workweeks when no
overlap occurs.</p>

              <p>(a)  
The stint or task basis of payment
is also used to some extent in industries other than the brick industry. In the
meat packing industry, the hours paid for at the agreed rate for the completion
of a pre-determined amount of work are called “cow hours” or “kill time”. In
the smelters of the metal refining industry the predetermined day’s work is
called the “heat”.</p><p>(b)

industries disclose that the stint or task basis of payment has been used to
compensate employees for overtime and where that method would appear to fall
within the principles outlined above, enforcement action shall not be taken
until an opinion is secured as to the validity of the method of payment. All of
the facts concerning the stint or task basis of payment shall be obtained and
the investigation referred to the Regional Office for discussion with, or
referral to, the Regional Attorney. The facts shall include information as to:</p><p>(1)  whether the hours necessary to complete the
predetermined amount of work, after which extra compensation of at least 50
percent is paid, are the employees’ normal working hours;</p><p>(2)  whether the employees are presently working more
hours;</p><p>(3)  how long they have been regularly working excess
hours;</p><p>(4)  whether the excess hours of work are due to seasonal
factors or emergency or transitory conditions which are not expected to be
permanent;</p><p>(5)  if the employees have always regularly worked excess
hours, whether the overtime standard adopted and applied was with the bona fide
intention of establishing it as the normal working period to which the regular
working hours will be conformed as soon as the necessary adjustments can
practicably be made;</p><p>(6)  whether the hours of work are different for different
groups of employees or different departments where the same overtime standard
is used;</p><p>(7)  whether there is any information available as to hours
of work and overtime standards used in other establishments in the same
industry and area; and,</p><p>(8)  the extent of compliance with other requirements of
Section 7(g)(1) or (2), as explained in IB778.415-.423 such as payment of extra
overtime compensation on other forms of additional pay required to be included

              <p>(a)  
In two respects a prepayment plan,
if it may be properly applied to salaried employees, is not subject to the same
restrictions as a time off plan. It is not confined, in its operations, to the
pay period. Credits to the employer, that is, amounts paid by him/her in excess
of the amounts earned by the employee or to which the employee is entitled, may
be carried over beyond the pay period until they are consumed by the OT work of
the employee. Secondly a prepayment plan may be applied to employees who are
paid weekly.</p><p>(b)  
Where applicable, a time off and
prepayment plan may be applied together</p><p>(c)  
These two plans are rarely used.

              <h3>32j18   Tipped employees.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
<b>Tip credit</b></p><p>Section
3(m) of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. 203(m), permits an employer meeting all of the
requirements of that section to take a &quot;tip credit&quot; as part of the
Sec. 6(a)(1) wage it is required to pay its tipped employees and further
provides that the “wage” of a tipped employee equals the sum of the direct or
cash wage paid by the employer (which cannot be less than $2.13 per hour) and
the additional amount the employer is using as a credit against tips received,
which cannot exceed the difference between the minimum wage specified in Sec.
6(a)(1) of the FLSA and the direct or cash wage paid.  See FOH 30d for a full
discussion of the tip credit.  </p><p>(b)  
<b>Tip credit in overtime hours</b></p><p>An
employer may not take a higher tip credit during overtime hours than during
non-overtime hours.  Under Sec. 3(m), the amount of the tip credit is the
difference between the direct wage paid (which cannot be less than $2.13 per
hour) and the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.  This formula determines the maximum
amount of an employee’s tips that can be considered wages per hour during the
workweek.  The amount of the tip credit may not increase during the workweek,
even during overtime hours.</p><p>(c)  
<b>Overtime Obligation  </b></p><p>FLSA
overtime principles apply to tipped employees in the same manner as they apply
to all covered, non-exempt employees.  </p><p>(d)  
<b>Determining the Regular Rate
for Tipped Employees  </b></p><p>The
regular rate for a tipped employee is determined by dividing the total
remuneration in any workweek, minus statutory exclusions, by the total hours
worked. 29 CFR 531.60.  The regular rate can never be less than the highest
applicable minimum wage.  29 CFR 778.5.</p><p>An
employer may claim a tip credit and also provide board, lodging, or other
facilities. See 29 CFR part 531; FOH30c.  The tip credit equals the difference
between the minimum wage and the direct wage paid, which may be comprised of
cash, board, lodging, and/or facilities, and must be at least $2.13 per hour. 
FOH30d06(b).  In determining the regular rate for a tipped employee, all
components of the employee’s wages must be considered (cash, board, lodging,
facilities, tip credit). Tips in excess of the FLSA tip credit are not
considered wages under Sec. 3(m) and are not considered in determining the
regular rate.  29 CFR 531.60.</p><p>In
determining the regular rate for a tipped employee, both the direct wage and
the tip credit must be included.  For example, if the employee is paid a direct
wage of $2.13 and the employer claims a tip credit of $5.12, the regular rate
will be $7.25 and the overtime rate will be $10.88 ($7.25 x 1.5).  The direct
wage payment in overtime hours would be $5.76 ($10.88 - $5.12); the overtime
direct wage payment is not 1.5 x the non-overtime direct wage payment.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>(1)  An employee works 50 hours in a tipped occupation. 
The employer pays a cash wage of $2.13 per hour and claims a tip credit of
$5.12.  The employer complies with the requirements in 29 CFR 531.59(b) to
inform its employees about the tip credit and the employee receives at least
$5.12 per hour in tips.</p><p>$7.25
regular rate ($2.13 cash wage + $5.12 tip credit)</p><p>50 x
7.25 = 362.50 (straight time)</p><p>10 x
.5 x 7.25 = 36.25 (overtime premium)</p><p>$398.75
total wages due</p><p>50 x
5.12 = 256 tip credit</p><p>398.75
– 256 = 142.75 direct wage</p><p>(2)  An employee works 45 hours in a tipped occupation. 
The employer pays a cash wage of $3.00 per hour and claims a tip credit of
$4.25.  The employer complies with the requirements in 29 CFR 531.59(b) to
inform its employees about the tip credit and the employee receives at least
$4.25 per hour in tips.</p><p>$7.25
regular rate ($3.00 cash wage + $4.25 tip credit)</p><p>45 x
7.25 = 326.25 (straight time)</p><p>5 x
.5 x 7.25 = 18.13 (overtime premium)</p><p>$
344.38 total wages due</p><p>45 x
4.25 = 191.25 tip credit</p><p>344.38
– 191.25 = $153.13 direct or cash wage</p><p>(e)  
<b>Deductions </b></p><p>When
an employer claims a tip credit, the tipped employee is considered to have been
paid only the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage for all non-overtime hours worked in a
tipped occupation.  See FOH 30d06.  An employer that claims a tip credit
therefore may not make deductions in a workweek of 40 hours or less for
non-3(m) costs such as shortages, breakage, cost of uniforms, etc., because any
such deduction would reduce the tipped employee’s wages below the minimum
wage.  Updating Regulations Issued Under the Fair Labor Standards Act; Final
Rule, 76 FR 18839, April 5, 2011; 29 CFR 531.36.  Because non-3(m) deductions
cannot be made in a workweek of 40 hours or less when the tip credit is
claimed, employers are also prohibited from taking such deductions in overtime
weeks, even when the regular rate is higher than the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage
(for example, when a higher state minimum wage is the regular rate).  See 29
CFR 531.37.  When an employer claims a tip credit, deductions for non-3(m)
items, therefore, cannot be valid in an overtime workweek, because deductions
not permitted in non-overtime workweeks are also prohibited in overtime
workweeks.  See 32j08(b).</p><p>An
employer may only make non-3(m) deductions from the wages of a tipped employee
when no tip credit is claimed and the direct or cash wage paid is greater than
the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.  </p><p>(f)  
<b>Regular Rate in Excess of FLSA
MW</b></p><p>When
Federal, state or local laws require an employer to pay a higher minimum wage
than required by FLSA, or if the wage set through established practice,
agreement, or understanding is greater than the  Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage, FLSA
overtime provisions require that the employee receive the regular rate for all
hours worked before overtime is calculated.  Where an employer claims a tip
credit under Sec. 3(m), straight time wages paid to the employee are capped at
the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.  See FOH30d00. Consequently, where the regular
rate exceeds the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage, before additional half time for
overtime is computed, the rate paid to the tipped employee in overtime weeks
must be raised to the regular rate.  The employer therefore owes the difference
between the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage and the regular rate in cash for all
hours worked as a tipped employee.  </p><p>(g)  
Questions regarding the proper
calculation of overtime pay often arise in situations where state or local laws
require an employer to pay a higher minimum wage than required by the FLSA and
permit the employer to claim a higher tip credit than permitted under the
FLSA.  </p><p>For
example, assume the state minimum wage is $7.50 and that the state law requires
a cash wage of $2.13 per hour and allows the employer to take a tip credit of
$5.37 per hour.  Assuming all hours worked during the week were at the state
minimum wage rate, the employee’s regular rate is the state minimum wage rate
($7.50) but the employer is limited to a tip credit of $5.12 under the FLSA
($7.25 – $2.13). See 29 CFR 778.5.  The employer must make up the difference
between the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage and the regular rate in cash before
calculating the additional half time due.  See FOH32j02.</p><p>(h)  <b>Examples of how to compute overtime for tipped
employees</b></p><p>For
purposes of these examples, assume the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage rate is $7.25
per hour, that the employee worked 45 hours in the workweek, and that all hours
worked were in a tipped occupation.  Assume the employee meets the Sec. 3(t)
definition of a tipped employee and that the employer complied with the
requirements in 29 CFR 531.59(b) to inform employees about the tip credit and
that the payroll records are accurate.</p><p>(1)  The state minimum wage is $7.40 per hour, the employer
pays a cash wage of $2.89 as required under state law and claims a tip credit
of $4.51.  The employee’s regular rate is $7.40 per hour.  </p><div>
