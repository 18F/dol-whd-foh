              <p>This Act applies to
contracts in excess of $2,000 for the construction, alteration, and/or repair
of public buildings or public works, including painting and decorating, where
the United States or the District of Columbia is a direct party to the
contract. The Act requires all contractors and subcontractors to pay the
various classes of laborers and mechanics employed on the site of the work on
the contract the wage rates and fringe benefits determined by the S/L to be
prevailing for corresponding classes of employees engaged on similar projects
in the locality. In addition, the Act requires that certain labor standards
provisions be specified in the contract awarded to the successful bidder (see
29 CFR § 5.5 (a)). An applicable wage determination must also be included in
the contract documents.</p>

              <h3>15a00 - Purpose and use of FOH Chapter 15.</h3>
              <p>(a)   This Chapter supplements 29 CFR Parts 1, 3, 5, 6, and
7, pertaining to a group of statutes generally identified as the Davis-Bacon
and Related Acts (DBRA) and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act
(CWHSSA). Many Related Acts are listed in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix A, and 29 CFR
§ 5.1. The Davis-Bacon Act (DBA or D-B Act), the Copeland Anti-Kickback Act,
the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, and 29 CFR Parts 1, 3, 5, 6,
and 7 are available at <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/contracts/dbra.htm">http://www.dol.gov/whd/contracts/dbra.htm</a><a name="_Hlt240128855"></a> or at http://<a href="http://www.wdol.gov">www.wdol.gov</a>/ in the “Library”.</p><p>(b)  Under Reorganization Plan No. 14 of 1950 (64 Stat.
1267) the Federal contracting or other administering agency has the primary
responsibility for the enforcement of the DBRA/CWHSSA labor standards
provisions included in its contracts. The Secretary of Labor (S/L) has
coordination and oversight responsibilities, including the authority to
investigate labor standards compliance as warranted. Pursuant to the authority
under the Plan, the S/L has issued the Regulations referenced in (a) to
coordinate the administration and enforcement of DBRA/CWHSSA labor standards.
All Agency Memorandum (AAM) No. 76, dated     May 31, 1968 to Agencies
Administering Statutes Referred to in 29 CFR, Part 5, Subpart A, reflects an
agreement between the DOL and the contracting agencies for administering the
labor standards of DBRA/CWHSSA. AAM Nos. 118, 129 and 177 were subsequently
issued to remind all contracting agencies of their labor standards enforcement
responsibilities.</p>

              <h3>15a02 - The Related Acts.</h3>
              <p>These are Federal statutes
which authorize Federal assistance in the form of contributions, grants, loans,
insurance, or guarantees for programs such as the construction of hospitals,
housing complexes, sewage treatment plants, highways, and airports. Included in
the language of these statutes are references to the D-B labor standards
provisions and the requirement that laborers and mechanics be paid prevailing
wage rates. Since Congress is continually enacting and amending legislation,
the list of the DBRAs in the Regulations may not be completely up to date.
Consequently, it may be necessary to consult the RO for verification of DBRA
coverage.</p>

              <h3>15a03 - The Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA).</h3>
              <p>(a)   This Act contains weekly (after 40 hours) OT pay
requirements and applies to most Federal contracts which may require or involve
the employment of laborers or mechanics, including watchmen and guards, and to
which any agency or instrumentality of the United States or the District of
Columbia or a Territory is a party. (See FOH 15g.) CWHSSA was amended by Public
Law 99-145 (effective January 1, 1986) to eliminate the daily OT provisions
(AAM # 143, Dec 23, 1985).</p><p>(b)  Contracts for construction or services in excess of
$100,000 are covered by CWHSSA. This Act also extends to Federally-assisted
contracts subject to DBRA wage standards to which the Federal government is not
a direct party, except where the Federal assistance is only in the nature of a
loan guarantee or insurance.</p><p>(c)   Contracts exempt from this Act are discussed in FOH
15i00.</p><p>(d)  Sec. 102 of CWHSSA requires that laborers and
mechanics employed on covered contracts be paid not less than one and one-half
times their basic rate of pay for hours worked in excess of forty in a w/w. It
also provides for liquidated damages in the sum of $10 for each calendar day
(with respect to each employee employed in violation) on which an employee was
required or permitted to work overtime hours without the payment of OT wages
required by CWHSSA.</p><p>(e)   Section 107 of the Act provides health and safety
standards on covered construction work which are administered by OSHA.</p>

              <h3>15a04 - The Copeland “Anti-Kickback” Act.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The “Anti-Kickback” section of the Copeland Act makes
it punishable by a fine or by imprisonment up to 5 years, or both, to induce
any person working on a Federally-funded or assisted construction project to
“give up any part of the compensation to which he is entitled under his
contract of employment”. (See “Anti-Kickback” Act, Copeland Act, and 29 CFR
Part 3)</p><p>(b)  Regulations pertaining to Copeland Act payroll
deductions are contained in 29 CFR Part 3. Deductions permissible without
application for approval by the S/L are explained in 29 CFR § 3.5; those which
require approval are explained in 29 CFR § 3.6. Note in 29 CFR § 3.5 that
certain deductions, including those which meet the requirements of FLSA Sec
3(m), 29 CFR Part 531, can be made without the consent of the S/L. The Copeland
Act and 29 CFR §§ 3.3 and 3.4 require the contractor or subcontractor to file a
weekly “Statement of Compliance”. 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(3)(ii) requires, as a
contract stipulation, that the contractor submit weekly to the contracting
agency a copy of all payrolls, along with a weekly “Statement of Compliance”.
Contractors may use Optional Form WH-347, available at <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/wh347instr.htm">http://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/wh347instr.htm</a> for this purpose.</p><p>(c)   The willful falsification of a payroll report or
“Statement of Compliance” may subject the employer to civil or criminal
prosecution under section 1001 of Title 18 and section 3729 of Title 31 of the
U.S.C. and may also be a cause for debarment.</p><p>(d)  The “Anti-Kickback” provision applies to any
Federally-funded or assisted construction contract except contracts for which
the only assistance is a loan guarantee. This provision applies even where the
contract is not covered by a labor standards statute. 29 CFR Part 3, as
explained above, applies only to payroll deductions made under contracts
subject to Federal wage standards.</p>

              <h3>15a05 - The Miller Act (40 U.S.C. §§ 3131-3133).</h3>
              <p>(a)   This Act provides, in general, that Federal contracts
in excess of $100,000 for construction, alteration, or repair of any public
building or public work of the United States, may not be awarded to any person,
until such person furnishes to the United States a bond with a surety
satisfactory to the contracting officer for the protection of all persons
supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in the
contract.</p><p>(b)  The Department of Labor exercises no functions under
the Miller Act, but the information in this section is pertinent since the Act
provides protection to laborers and mechanics, and its application is
coextensive with the D-B Act, except for the $100,000 threshold. In order to
protect their rights under this Act, employees of prime contractors or first-tier
subcontractors must give written notice by registered mail to the prime
contractor of failure to receive proper wages within 90 days of the date of
performance of the last labor by the underpaid worker. Employees of lower tier
sub-subcontractors are not protected by the Act.</p><p>(c)   Suits to recover wages under the Miller Act must be
commenced within one year after the date on which the last of the labor was
performed and must be brought in the name of the United States, for the use of
the person suing, in the United States District Court for any district in which
the contract was to be performed and executed. Suit is brought and prosecuted
by the worker’s own attorney. Although the Miller Act does not apply to
Federally-assisted projects (i.e., the Related Acts), many States and grant
programs require surety bonds with substantially similar requirements.</p>

              <h3>15b00 - Coverage - General.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Coverage is extended to construction contracts awarded
directly by the Federal government or financially assisted under any statute
referencing D-B labor standards, including but not limited to those listed in
29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. However, if a statute authorizes assistance but does not
include either directly or by reference aD-B labor standards clause, the DBRA
does not apply. (See (b) below.)</p><p>(b)  In situations where a project is funded under a number
of Federal statutes, DBRA applies to the project if any one of the statutes
authorizing a portion of the financial assistance requires payment of Davis
Bacon wages. To verify coverage under various DBRA contracts, contact the
Regional Wage Specialist (RWS).</p><p>(c)   The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (Pub.
L. 97-424), effective January 6, 1983, expanded D-B coverage to all Federal-aid
highway construction projects to include those involving resurfacing,
restoration, rehabilitation, and reconstruction (“4-R” work). Previously,
Section 113 of Title 23, U.S.C., The Federal-Aid Highway Act, had been
construed to exclude 4-R work from “initial construction.”</p><p>(d)  The $2,000 threshold for coverage pertains to the
amount of the prime contract, not to the amount of individual subcontracts. If
the prime contract exceeds $2,000, all work on the project is covered.</p>

              <p>The scope of the D-B is
limited, by its terms, to the fifty states and the District of Columbia and the
Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. The scope of each of the related Acts
is determined by the terms of the particular statute under which the Federal
assistance is provided. For example, DBRA would apply to a construction
contract funded under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 located
in Guam or the Virgin Islands. However, although direct D-B would not apply in
places such as Guam or the Virgin Islands, CWHSSA would apply. (See FOH 15g00.)</p>

              <h3>15b02 - Statute of limitations.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The Portal-to-Portal Act (PA) applies to the D-B Act.
It prevents the commencement of any court suit for unpaid straight-time wages
more than 2 years after performance of the work (3 years in the case of willful
violations), where such actions are judicially determined to be permissible
under the law. However, it is the Department’s position that the PA does not
apply to administrative actions initiated through the ALJ hearing procedures,
and thus, the PA does not preclude such corrective administrative action after
two (or three) years.</p><p>(b)  Failure to pay the minimum rates specified in a D-B contract
is a breach of the contract, and the contracting agency may withhold funds
sufficient to pay the unpaid employees. Such funds may be withheld from the
contractor without regard to the statute of limitations in the PA and may be
transferred to the Comptroller General and paid to the underpaid employee
without regard to such time limit.</p><p>(c)   The PA does not apply to Federally-assisted projects
(the Related Acts) on which D-B wage rates are required to be paid. The various
State statutes of limitations would apply to such projects in private actions
where they are judicially determined to be permissible under the law. The
federal six-year statute of limitations would apply in government enforcement
actions (28 U.S.C. § 2415(a)).</p>

rates not less than those stated in the advertised specifications. The Related
Acts which provide for Federal construction assistance contain no reference to
“site of the work”. However, 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(1)(i) prescribes a contract clause
which in effect extends the “site of the work” concept to the Related Acts.
Certain HUD Related Acts, including the United States Housing Act of 1937 and
the Housing Act of 1949, however, specifically require payment of not less than
the wage rates prescribed to all mechanics and laborers employed “in the
construction and development of the project”. In short there is no “site of the
work” concept with respect to the United States Housing Act of 1937 or the
Housing Act of 1949. (It should be noted that the OT requirements of CWHSSA
apply to all laborers and mechanics performing contract work, regardless of the
site of their employment. See FOH l5g03.)</p><p>(b)  The D-B Act limits coverage to laborers and mechanics
employed on the “site of the work” but does not define this term. “Site of the
work” is defined in 29 CFR § 5.2(l). The description below provides general
guidance used by WHD in D-B and DBRA investigations:</p><p>(1) 
The “site of the work” is the
physical place or places where the building or work called for in the contract
will remain and any other site where a significant portion of the building or
work is constructed, provided that such site is established specifically for
the performance of the contract or project. (29 CFR § 5.2(l)(1)) For example:</p><p>                                             
a.     if a small office building is being erected, the “site
of work” will normally include no more than the building itself and its
grounds.</p><p>                                            
b.     In the case of larger contracts, such as for airports,
highways, or dams, the “site of the work” is necessarily more extensive and may
include the whole area in which the construction activity will take place.</p><p>                                             
c.     Where a very large segment of the dam is constructed
up-river and floated downstream to be affixed onto a support structure, the
secondary construction site would be within the meaning of “site of the work”
for Davis-Bacon purposes if it was established for and dedicated to the dam
construction project.</p><p>(2) 
Except as provided in paragraph 29
CFR § 5.2(l)(3), batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards, etc.,
are part of the “site of work” provided they are dedicated exclusively or
nearly so to the contract or project, and are adjacent or virtually adjacent to
the site of the work as defined in 29 CFR § 5.2(l)(1).</p><p>(3) 
Not included in the ”site of the work”
are permanent home offices, branch plant establishments, fabrication plants,
and tool yards, etc. of a contractor or subcontractor whose locations and
continuance in operation are determined wholly without regard to a particular
Federal or federally-assisted contract or project. </p><p>Also excluded from the “site of the work” are
fabrication plants, batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards,
etc, of a commercial or material supplier which are established by a supplier
of materials for the project before opening of bids and not on the site of the
work as stated in 29 CFR § 5.2(l)(1), even where such operations for a period
of time may be dedicated exclusively, or nearly so, to the performance of a
contract.</p><p>(c)   Once the limits of “site of the work” have been
determined, the wage determination applies only to those mechanics and laborers
employed by a contractor or subcontractor on the site of the work.</p><p>(d)  In 2000, DOL revised the two related definitions in
the regulations that set forth rules for the administration and enforcement of
the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements. Revisions in the regulatory
definitions of “site of the work” and “construction, prosecution, completion,
or repair” were made to clarify the regulatory requirements in view of three U.
S. appellate court decisions, which had concluded that DOL’s application of
these related regulatory definitions was at odds with the language of the
Davis-Bacon Act that limits coverage to workers employed “directly upon the
site of the work,”. </p><p>For a full discussion of the
revisions made to the regulatory definition of the “site of the work” in 2000,
see the final rule published in the Federal Register on December 20, 2000, 65
FR 80268-80278. (see also Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO
v. United States Department of Labor Wage Appeals Board, 932 F.2d 985(D.C. Cir
1991) (Midway), Ball, Ball and Brosamer v. Reich (D.C. Cir 1994) and Cavett
Company v. U.S. Department of Labor 101 F. 3d 1111 (6th Cir. 1996). </p><p>(e)   The FAR (48 CFR §§ 52.222.5 through .11) has been
revised to address the issue of secondary sites that may be considered to be
within the regulatory definition of “site of the work”. Therefore, federal
contract stipulations include provisions that address the possibility of a
covered secondary site of work. Contracting agencies should consult the Wage
and Hour Division when confronted with “site of work” issues.</p><p>(f)   CWHSSA has no site of work limitation. (See FOH
15g03.)</p>

work.</h3>
              <p>(a)   In some instances a Government agency (or a State or
political subdivision thereof using Federal money) may perform construction
work under what is generally known as “force account”. In essence, this is a
“do-it-yourself” type of construction - the governmental agency receiving the
grant decides not to contract out the work but actually performs it “in-house”
with its own employees. Such work is not generally subject to DBRA/CWHSSA
because governmental agencies and States or their political subdivisions are
not considered “contractors” or “subcontractors” within the meaning of the D-B
Act. However, any part of the work not done under “force account” but
contracted out is subject to DBRA/CWHSSA in the usual manner.</p><p>(b)  Certain related acts require payment of prevailing
wages to all laborers and mechanics “employed in the construction (or
development) of the project” (e.g., the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 and the
Housing Act of 1949). (See FOH l5e13.) State and local government agencies
receiving Federal assistance under statutes containing this or similar wording
not restricting coverage to employees of contractors or subcontractors, which
perform construction with their own employees, must pay such employees
according to DBRA/CWHSSA.</p>

              <p>(a)   Where the Government enters into a lease/purchase
agreement D-B applies, because the cost of the construction is eventually paid
for by the Government. D-B also applies to a lease option or to a term lease
agreement where there is substantial and segregable construction activity, and
where the structure is a public building or public work. This may be true, for
example, where the building is built at the request of the Government pursuant
to Government specifications for Government use or purpose for the period of
the lease.</p><p>(b)  AAM #176 identifies the following factors as among
those to be considered in determining whether a lease/construction contract is
construction for Davis-Bacon:</p><p>(1) 
“Length of Lease”,</p><p>(2) 
Extent of government involvement
in the construction project (such as whether the building is being built to
Government requirements and whether the Government has the right to inspect the

              <h3>15c00 - Exceptions to coverage.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Section 4 of the D-B Act provides that “this Act shall
not be construed to supersede or impair any authority otherwise granted by
Federal law to provide for the establishment of specific wage rates.” Thus, for
example:</p><p>(1) 
If a railroad undertakes to
perform a contract normally subject to DBRA, coverage is not extended to
employees of railroad common carriers if they are covered by the Railway Labor
Act. However, if the railroad contracts out such construction work, laborers
and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors are covered.</p><p>(2) 
While the D-B Act contains no
express exemption for common carriers, coverage is not extended to common
carriers who are hauling over regularly scheduled routes in accordance with
published tariff rates and pursuant to a bill of lading. On the other hand,
transportation of materials from an exclusive borrow pit to fulfill the
specific needs of a construction contract would not normally be within the common
carrier exception since such transportation is not normally carried out over a
regularly scheduled route in accordance with published tariff rates and
pursuant to a bill of lading.</p><p>(b)  Under the terms of certain authorizing statutes, DBRA
does not apply to construction of less than a designated number of housing
units. For example:</p><p>(1) 
Section 110 of the Housing and
Community Development Act of 1974 - rehabilitation of residential property
designed for fewer than 8 families.</p><p>(2) 
Section 802 of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1974 - construction of residential property designed for
fewer than 8 families.</p><p>(3) 
Section 12 of the U.S. Housing Act
of 1937 - fewer than 9 units.</p><p>(4) 
Sections 212, 220 and 233 of the
National Housing Act - fewer than 12 units.</p><p>(5) 
Sections 212, 221 and 235(j) (1)
of the National Housing Act - fewer than 8 families.</p><p>(6) 
Section 287 of the Cranston-Gonzalez
National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 - fewer than 12 units</p><p>(c)   Section 14 of the United States Housing Act of 1937
established the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP), under
which HUD provides financial assistance to public housing agencies for
improvement of existing public housing projects and upgrading of the management
and operation of such projects. Section 12 of that Act sets forth the labor
standards which must be contained in any contract for loans, annual
contributions, sale or leases pursuant to the Act, and provides that (1) all
laborers and mechanics employed in the development of a CIAP-funded lower
income housing project be paid DBRA wages, and (2) all maintenance laborers and
mechanics employed in the operation of such a project be paid wages prevailing
in the locality as established by HUD. While most CIAP-funded work items are
developmental for purposes of prevailing wage rate determinations and are
therefore subject to DBRA, certain work items (“non-routine maintenance”,
formerly referred to by HUD as “major repairs”), in addition to routine
maintenance, are recognized as operational and are subject to HUD-determined
(not DBRA) rates. HUD has issued guidance to its field offices and public
housing agencies (see also 24 CFR §§ 968.105 and 110), which distinguishes work
items subject to HUD-determined or to DBRA prevailing wages. In essence, repair
or replacement necessitated by normal wear and tear over time is to be
considered operational and outside the coverage of DBRA, provided that the work
is not so substantial as to constitute reconstruction. Thus, conversion of
equipment or premises and replacement or alteration of property which results
in betterment and involves significant construction activity is subject to
DBRA. Any questions on the proper classification of particular work items
subject to DBRA under CIAP which cannot be resolved locally with HUD will be
referred though channels to the RWS and NO, if necessary. WH does not enforce
HUD-determined wage rates under CIAP.</p><p>(d)  Construction projects administered by the Farmers Home
Administration and funded under the Community Facility Program of the Farm and
Rural Development Act of 1972 or under section 515, Title V of the Housing Act
of 1949, as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, do
not contain D-B labor standards and are not covered if there is no other
federal assistance containing D-B labor standards.</p><p>(e)   Projects solely funded under the Land and Water

              <h3>15d00 - ARRA-American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Davis-Bacon coverage under ARRA. </p><p>(1) 
AAM #207 outlined the
applicability of the DB labor standards to ARRA funded projects. The ARRA was
signed by President Obama on February 17, 2009. The ARRA appropriated
substantial funding for construction, alteration and repair of Federal
buildings and for infrastructure projects. Federal agencies directly
contracting for construction work are required by existing DBA requirements to
ensure that bid solicitations and resulting contracts contain DB labor
standards and WDs. Federal agencies must ensure that recipients of assistance
under ARRA require contractors and subcontractors to pay laborers and mechanics
on Federally-assisted construction projects at least the prevailing wages as
determined under the DBA.</p><p>Specifically, Section 1606 of Division A of ARRA
states that DBA’s prevailing wage requirement applies to ARRA-appropriated
construction projects, as follows: “Notwithstanding any other provision of law
and in a manner consistent with other provisions of this Act, all laborers and
mechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors on projects funded
directly by or assisted in whole or in part by and through the Federal
government pursuant to this Act shall be paid wages at rates not less than
those prevailing on projects of a character similar in the locality as
determined by the Secretary of Labor… .”</p><p>The language “notwithstanding any other provision of
law” explicitly overrides any limitation to Davis-Bacon coverage that may be
contained in other Davis-Bacon Related Acts. Therefore, if a construction
project is funded under multiple statutes, including one with a pre-existing
Davis-Bacon related Act provision as well as ARRA, then the ARRA prevailing
wage requirement applies if any such ARRA assistance is provided for the
project.</p><p>Two provisions of ARRA exempt certain tribal contracts
from Section 1606. One provision states that section 1606 does not apply “to
tribal contracts entered into by the Bureau of Indian Affairs” with the
appropriations provided under ARRA for repair and restoration of roads; school
improvements, repairs and replacement construction; and detention center
maintenance and repairs. A second provision states that section 1606 does not
apply “to tribal contracts entered into by the [HHS Indian Health] Service&quot;
with the ARRA appropriation for Indian health facilities construction projects.
Of course, even though ARRA does not apply DB to those projects, if the
projects receive funding under another related Act that requires DB prevailing
wage requirements, those requirements would continue to apply.</p><p>Prevailing wage coverage under ARRA-assisted projects
must be determined in the same manner as under the DBA. ARRA-assisted projects
must follow the requirements in regulations 29 CFR 1, 3 and 5.</p><p>(2) 
AAM # 208 outlined the
applicability of the DB labor standards to projects financed with the proceeds
of the five tax-favored bonds listed in section 1601 of Division B of ARRA. It
also highlighted the responsibilities of state and local governmental entities,
contractors, and others for implementation of, and compliance with, the
Davis-Bacon labor standards in connection with projects financed with the
proceeds of the tax-favored bonds.</p><p>Specifically, Section 1601 of Division B of ARRA provides
that the DBA’s prevailing wage requirement applies to projects financed with
the proceeds of:</p><p>                                             
a.     Any new clean renewable energy bond (as defined in
section 54C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) issued after the date of the
enactment of ARRA Division B.</p><p>                                            
b.     Any qualified energy conservation bond (as defined in
section 4D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) issued after the date of the
enactment of ARRA Division B.</p><p>                                             
c.     Any qualified zone academy bond (as defined in section
54E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) issued after the date of the
enactment of ARRA Division B.</p><p>                                            
d.     Any qualified school construction bond (as defined in
section 54F of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).</p><p>                                             
e.     Any recovery zone economic development bond (as
defined in section 1400U–2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).</p><p>An entity (usually a state or local government agency)
with contracting responsibility for a project financed with the proceeds of one
of the five tax-favored bonds must cause or require the contracting officer for
the project, at least as soon as the entity receives notice of ARRA assistance
with respect to the project, to insert in full the standard D-B contract
clauses found in 29 CFR 5.5(a) (and the applicable wage determination in effect
at the time of notice of ARRA assistance) in bid solicitations and covered
construction contracts that are in excess of $2,000 for construction,
alteration or repair (including painting and decorating).</p><p>The requirement to insert the standard D-B contract
clauses and attach the applicable wage determination in effect at the time of
notice of ARRA assistance applies regardless of the amount or form of ARRA
funding or assistance. Thus, coverage under section 1601 of Division B of ARRA
can exist even if a project is financed only in part by proceeds of one of the
bonds listed in section 1601. If bond proceeds are pooled in a general fund or
otherwise, then every project financed in whole or in part by the pooled
proceeds is subject to Davis-Bacon requirements provided that other applicable
coverage criteria are satisfied.</p><p>(b)  Weatherization contracts.</p><p>Using ARRA appropriations,
the Department of Energy awards grants under the Weatherization Assistance
Program to state-level government agencies. These agencies then contract with
local agencies, usually Community Action Agencies, to deliver weatherization
services to eligible residents. Individuals and families apply for assistance
through the local agencies. If approved for services, professionally trained
weatherization assistance program technicians perform on-site audits to identify
cost-effective measures that can be taken. Crews then make the repairs and
improvements to increase energy efficiency. The technicians conducting the
audits are typically employees of the governmental or community action agency.
The repair crews typically work for contractors. </p><p>It is WHD’s longstanding
position that governmental agencies are not contractors or subcontractors
within the meaning of the DBA when the construction is performed by their own
employees on a “force account” basis. (See FOH 15b06.) However, laborers or
mechanics employed by a private, non-profit Community Action Agency cannot be
considered as force account labor and will be covered under the DB labor
standards requirements when performing ARRA-assisted weatherization work. In addition,
when the Community Action Agency contracts out work that is assisted with ARRA
funding, the Agency must apply the DB labor standards and appropriate WD to the
contract. Therefore, repair crews performing the duties of laborers or
mechanics for a Community Action Agency or its contractors must be paid at
least the DB prevailing wage. Certain activities such as energy audits and
inspections are not viewed as construction work performed by laborers or
mechanics within the meaning of the DBA.</p><p>(c)   State Energy Program (SEP) and individual homeowners.</p><p>DOE, through its Office of
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), operates a State Energy Program
(SEP) that provides grants to States that may be used to fund individual
States’ SEP plans. These grants are funded in whole or in part by ARRA. An
individual homeowner who receives a rebate for material and/or labor costs he
or she has incurred in connection with qualifying energy efficiency and
weatherization improvements to his or her home under a DOE SEP rebate program
is not responsible for Davis-Bacon compliance. This general interpretation
addresses only whether Davis-Bacon labor standards apply to individual
homeowners who receive a rebate, funded in whole or in part by ARRA, to
reimburse them pursuant to DOE programs for certain energy efficiency and
weatherization improvements to their homes.</p>

contractor and subcontractors have finished their work, left the site, and the

              <p>(a)   To determine whether a demolition contract is subject
to DBRA, it is necessary to look at the entire scope of that contract as well
as other contracts that might be part of the same overall project. Demolition,
standing alone, (except for demolition work under Urban Renewal projects
authorized pursuant to the Housing Act of 1949, as amended) is not necessarily
considered to be “construction, alteration, and/or repair of a public building
or a public work” subject to the prevailing wage requirements of DBRA. For
example, the demolition of a building because such structure is no longer
needed would not in itself be a covered construction activity. However, where
an existing building is being demolished and further construction activity at
the site is contemplated that is subject to DBRA, DBRA would apply to such
demolition, such as demolition performed to permit construction of a new
building or highway (AAM # 190, see also FOH 14d08).</p><p>(b)  In some cases, the nature of the demolition or removal
work alone might be considered construction activity covered by DBA. Removal of
asbestos or paint from a facility that will not be demolished would be
considered to be an alteration or repair (AAM # 153) and certain hazardous
waste removal contracts that involve substantial earth moving to remove
contaminated soil and re-contour the surface may be considered construction
(AAM # 187).</p>

applies to any direct construction contracts awarded by Federal agencies such
as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), Federal Emergency Management
Administration (FEMA), or the U.S. Army.</p><p>DB labor standards also
apply to Federally-assisted contracts where the statute authorizing the funding
requires payment of prevailing wage rates in accordance with the DBRA. An
example of such a contract is an EPA grant to complete sewer repair where the
grant is funded by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.</p><p>Grants for disaster relief
under FEMA’s principal relief authority, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief
Act, are not subject to the DBA prevailing wage requirements. FEMA provides
grants for disaster assistance including low-interest loans to repair or
replace personal property, business disaster loans to fund repair or
replacement of real estate, and assistance to state or local governments to pay
costs of rebuilding a community’s damaged infrastructure.</p>

              <h3>15d05 - Drilling work in various
situations.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The application of the Act to a contract for drilling
work would turn upon whether the contract is one for “construction” of “public
works” within the meaning of the D-B Act.</p><p>(b)  Exploratory drilling.</p><p>Drilling, like excavating
generally, is usually considered “construction” activity. The critical question
is whether the holes which would be dug during the course of the exploratory
drilling would be “works” within the statutory term “public work”. The word
“works” in the term “public work” refers typically to improvements, such as
buildings, canals, or roads, rather than mere progress or activity.
Consequently, exploratory drilling for the purpose of obtaining data to be used
in engineering studies and the planning of a project such as a dam and
reservoir, the actual construction of which has not been authorized and for
which funds have not yet been appropriated, would not be within the term “work”
because it relates to an activity as distinguished from a project or
improvement.</p><p>Also, the holes themselves,
which are opened to obtain cores and which are subsequently to be filled in or
abandoned, would not be “works” because they are not improvements. The products
sought by the digging are the cores of the earth and not the holes themselves.
(See also FOH 14d02.) In contrast, wells drilled to obtain a water supply for a
military base or a contract for digging of test holes which later may become
“public works” or permit conversion to water wells, oil wells or other “public
works” are covered.</p><p>(c)   Soil boring prior to or during construction for the
purpose of setting foundations.</p><p>Soil boring contracts are
considered covered by the DBRA if they are directly related and incidental to,
or an integral part of, the actual construction process. This is to be
distinguished from the situation where such contracts are for the formulation
of engineering plans and specifications, designs, and the conduct of site
investigations. The latter activities are regarded as preliminary work, and not
as a part of the construction process. (Also see FOH 14d04.)</p><p>(d)  Plugging of oil or gas wells.</p><p>A contract which calls for
the plugging of oil or gas wells and the removal of above-ground equipment in
connection with the construction of a reservoir on land containing such wells
would be covered by the DBRA no matter whether the work is characterized as
demolition (the dismantling of the above-ground equipment), incidental to
construction, or well drilling (the rerunning of the tubing and replacement of
the cement plugs).</p>

such work would be subject to the DBRA labor standards requirements of the

city water department under which the department installs water mains in
streets adjacent to a housing project; connects mains and meters to the project’s

and meters without expense to the Authority beyond an initial service charge,
since the city is engaged essentially in the extension of its water
distribution system rather than in the development of the project.</p><p>(d)  Also, employees of a telephone company engaged in the

include the nature of the prime contract work, the type of work performed by
the employees installing the equipment on the project site (i.e., the

              <h3>15e01 - Apprentices.</h3>
              <p>(a)   An apprentice (29 CFR § 5.2(n)(l)) is (1) any person
employed under a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State
apprenticeship agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor,
Employment and Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship Training,
Employer and Labor Services (OA), or if no such recognized agency exists in a
State, under a program registered with the OA itself, or, (2) a person in the
first 90 days of probationary employment as an apprentice in such an approved
apprenticeship program who is not individually registered in the program, but
who has been certified by OA or a State apprenticeship agency (as appropriate)
to be eligible for probationary employment as an apprentice. All apprentices
other than probationary apprentices must be individually registered in the
approved program. Consistent with the level of training in the program, an
apprentice will perform for the appropriate period of time all levels of work,
from the lowest unskilled laborer’s work to the highest skilled or craft work
of the finished mechanic, under the supervision of the journeyworker. To be
employed in compliance with the Regulations the following guidelines must be
observed:</p><p>(b)  Allowable ratio - apprentices to journeyworkers.</p><p>(1) 
The allowable ratio of apprentices
to journeyworkers employed on the contract work in any craft classification
will not be greater than the ratio permitted the contractor as to the entire
work force under the registered program. (See 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i).) The
allowable ratio is to be applied on a daily basis. If a contractor has both an
apprentice and a trainee program, the trainees must be counted together with
the apprentices in determining compliance with the allowable ratio (i.e., the
journeyworkers may not be counted twice).</p><p>(2) 
For the purpose of illustration
only, assume that a contractor is allowed a ratio of one apprentice to every
three journeyworkers under the terms of the approved plan. This same ratio
would apply on DBRA covered jobs. Thus, in this example, the allowable number
of apprentices is illustrated by the following chart:</p><div>

<table>
 <tbody><tr>
  <td>
  <p>Journeyworkers</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>Allowable
  Apprentices</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
  <p>0-2</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>0</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
  <p>3-5</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>1</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
  <p>6-8</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>2</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
  <p>9-11</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>3</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table>

</div><p>NOTE: The ratios are applied in terms of whole number
increments for the journeyworkers (as reflected in the preceding chart) and not
in terms of “fractions thereof,” unless a different standard is specified in
the approved plan. Also, the allowable ratio will vary from plan to plan.</p><p>(3) 
Recognizing that the DBRA work may
be performed in a location other than the place where the program registration
was initially made, the allowable ratio is the ratio specified in the
contractor’s or subcontractor’s registered program (see 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i)).</p><p>(4) 
A working supervisor or owner may
be counted as a journeyworker for ratio purposes provided such a worker spends
the majority of his or her time in the craft, at the site.</p><p>(5) 
In determining the proper ratios,
“bootstrapping” is not allowed. For example, if an employer has employees who
are misclassified and determined to be entitled to the journeyworker’s rate or
has utilized an excessive number of apprentices who are also entitled to the
journeyworker’s rate, such employees cannot then be counted as “journeyworker”
for ratio purposes.</p><p>(c)   Registered apprentice ratio exceeded.</p><p>If a contractor or
subcontractor employs apprentices in such a number that the permissible ratio
is exceeded, all apprentices employed in excess of the ratio are considered to
have been improperly employed and will be entitled to the rate for the
classification of work which they are performing. For example, if an employer
is permitted to employ three apprentices under an approved plan and it is
disclosed that the employer is employing five apprentices on the project, the
first three apprentices employed on the project will be considered within the
quota; the last two employed will be considered improperly employed and must be
paid the full prevailing wage rate for the work performed. As a practical
matter, if it is impossible to determine which apprentices were first employed
on the project, any equitable formula for allocating the time due at the
applicable prevailing wage rate will be acceptable. For example, in the
preceding situation, it would be permissible and equitable to rotate three of
the five apprentices each week as a solution to the problem of which of these
employees were “first” employed on the project. The remaining two employees
would then be allocated the full prevailing wage rate in a manner which
distributes the time improperly employed as equally as possible.</p><p>(d)  Evidence of bona fide apprenticeship registration.</p><p>29 CFR § 5.5(a)(3)(i)
requires that a contractor or subcontractor utilizing apprentices maintain
written evidence of the registration of the program and the apprentices, and of
the ratios and wage rates prescribed in the applicable programs.</p><p>(e)   Unregistered apprentices.</p><p>29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i)
provides that any employee listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate who
is not a bona fide registered or probationary apprentice must be paid the wage
rate for the classification of work actually performed. However, the fact that
a worker is listed on the payrolls as an apprentice in a particular craft and
paid an apprentice wage rate for that craft does not, in itself, mean that
person performed only the work of, or used only the tools of, the craft in
which the person is an unregistered apprentice, and it does not mean that the
worker must be compensated only at the contract rate for that craft
classification. Such an employee may actually be performing work as a laborer
or in another craft classification, and must receive at least the rate
applicable for the classification(s) of work actually performed.</p><p>(f)   Employment of apprentices by more than one employer.</p><p>Employment of a properly
registered apprentice by more than one employer does not affect his/her status.
The transfer of apprentices from one employer to another to provide varied work
and training is an accepted construction industry practice.</p><p>(g)   Wage computations for apprentices.</p><p>In some instances, bona fide
apprenticeship programs contain percentages which are applied to a stipulated
wage rate (e.g., stated in the approved apprenticeship program or set forth in
a collective bargaining agreement), the product of which results in the wage
rate paid to the apprentice. While such a computation is acceptable on
construction projects not subject to the DBRA, the contractor on covered
projects is bound by any higher wage rates in the WD and the percentages should
be computed against the journeyworker’s basic rate found in the WD. Some
apprenticeship agreements may specify dollar amounts, rather than percentages
of the journeyworker’s rate, for various levels of progress. For this type of
apprenticeship training program, in order to determine whether the apprentice
is properly paid it is necessary to convert the dollar amounts to a percentage
of the journeyworker’s basic rate in the training program. This is then applied
to the rate specified in the WD. For example, where the journeyworker’s rate
contained in the apprenticeship training program for a particular craft is
$16.00 per hour and the apprentices are to receive $8.00, $10.00, $12.00, or
$14.00, depending on their level of progress, the percentages to be applied against
the journeyworker’s rate in the WD should be 50%, 63%, 75%, and 88%,
respectively. In addition, the apprentices are also entitled to receive fringe
benefits in accordance with the provisions of the apprenticeship program. If
the approved program is silent as to fringe benefits, apprentices must be paid
the full amount of fringe benefits listed in the WD for their classification,
unless the Administrator determines that a different practice prevails in the
locality of the construction project for that particular apprentice
classification.</p>

the approval (or recognition) by the Department’s Employment and Training

journeyworker hourly rate specified in the applicable WD. Also, trainees are to
be paid the fringe benefits stipulated in the trainee program. If the program
does not mention fringe benefits, trainees must receive the fringe benefits
reflected on the WD for the craft. </p><p>NOTE: An exception to this
rule applies if the Administrator determines that there is a corresponding

allowable ratio, ratio exceeded, evidence of apprenticeship, unregistered
apprentices, employment by more than one employer, and wage computations for

not apply to apprentices and trainees performing on Federal-aid highway

devices (e.g., barricades, directional signs, lights, arrowboards, etc.) are
generally covered by DBRA. However, traffic service companies which rent
equipment to the prime contractor and perform only incidental functions at the
site in connection with delivery of the equipment are regarded as material
suppliers whose employees would not be subject to DBRA unless particular

              <p>(a)   An individual employed in a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional capacity, as defined in 29 CFR Part 541, is not
a laborer or mechanic for purposes of DBRA.</p><p>(b)  A supervisory employee who is not exempt under 29 CFR
Part 541 and who spends more than a substantial amount of time (20 percent) in
a given w/w as a “laborer” or “mechanic” must be paid the applicable DBRA
prevailing wage rate for the classification of work performed for all hours
engaged in such work as a laborer or mechanic. For example, if a nonexempt
working foreman spends 60 percent or 24 hours of a 40 hour w/w performing
administrative functions such as preparing time cards, supervising the project
work, and arranging for deliveries and the remaining 40 percent (16 hours) of
the time performing the duties of an electrician, the individual must be paid
the electrician’s prevailing wage rate for the 16 hours. (See 29 CFR § 5.2(m).)</p><p>(c)   An employee who owns at least a bona fide 20-percent
equity interest in the enterprise in which he or she is employed, regardless of
the type of business organization (e.g., corporation, partnership, or other),
and who is actively engaged in its management, is considered a bona fide exempt
executive. The salary and salary basis requirements do not apply to the
exemption of business owners under 29 C.F.R. § 541.101. An individual with a 20
percent or greater interest in a business who is required to work long hours,
makes no management decisions, supervises no one and has no authority over
personnel does not qualify for the executive exemption. To qualify for the
exemption, a minority owner with at least a bona-fide 20 percent interest in
the business must be an employee of the business and actively engaged in
management. See 29 C.F.R. § 541.101.</p>

              <p>(a)   The manufacture and delivery to the work site of
supply items such as sand, gravel, and ready-mixed concrete, when accomplished
by bona fide material suppliers operating facilities serving the public in
general, are activities not covered by DBRA. This would be so even though the
materials are delivered directly into a contractor’s mixing facilities at the
work site. Such bona fide material suppliers are not considered contractors
under DBRA. Thus, their employees are not subject to DBRA labor standards. (See
also FOH 15b04 and 15e22.)</p><p>(b)  A particular facility set up at or near a construction
site for the purpose of fulfilling the material requirements of a contract and
thus subject to the DBRA initially, may undergo a change in its character to
such an extent that it becomes the operation of a “supplier.” This would be so,
for example, if it makes a sufficient quantity of sales from its producing
facility to the general public. What constitutes a “sufficient quantity” of
sales to the general public depends on the circumstances in each case, but must
be more than mere token sales.</p><p>(c)   If a material supplier, manufacturer, or carrier
undertakes to perform a part of a construction contract as a subcontractor, its
laborers and mechanics employed at the site of the work would be subject to
DBRA in the same manner as those employed by any other contractor or
subcontractor. Employees of a material supplier who are required to perform
more than an incidental amount of construction work in any w/w at the site of
work would be covered by the DBRA and due the applicable wage rate for the
classification of work performed. This would include warranty and/or repair
work. For example, if an employee of a supplier of precast concrete items is
required to go to the project site to repair and clean such items and in so
doing performs more than an incidental amount of construction activity on the
contract, the individual would be subject to DBRA. Similarly, an employee of an
equipment rental dealer or tire repair company who performs on-site repair work
on leased equipment is subject to DBRA if the employee performs more than an
incidental amount of work on the site. For enforcement purposes, if such an
employee spends more than 20% of his/her time in a workweek engaged in such
activities on the site, he/she is DBRA covered for all time spent on the site
during that workweek.</p><p>(d)  29 CFR § 5.2(l) specifically excludes from the
definition of “site of the work” permanent fabrication plants, batch plants,
borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards, etc., of a commercial supplier or
“materialman” that are established by a supplier of materials for the project
before opening of bids and are near to but not on the actual project site, even
where such operations for a period of time may he dedicated exclusively, or
nearly so, to the performance of a contract. (See FOH 15b04(b) and 29 CFR

29 CFR § 5.5(a)(6).)</p><p>(c)   When the labor standards clauses are omitted from
subcontracts in which they should have been included, and are not incorporated
by reference in the subcontracts, the right of the subcontractor’s employees to
receive compensation in accordance with the wage determination in the prime
contact is not affected. In such circumstances, since the subcontractor did not
contract to pay the DBRA rates, the subcontractor would not generally be held
responsible. However, the prime contractor would be obligated to pay the
subcontractor’s laborers and mechanics as required by the labor standards
provisions of the prime contract.</p>

              <p>(a)   The term “wage determination” includes the original
decision and any subsequent decisions modifying, superseding, correcting, or
otherwise changing the provisions of the original decision.</p><p>(b)  There are four basic categories of WDs based on the
type of construction (see AAM#130 and AAM #131):</p><p>Building: Sheltered
enclosures with walk-in access for the purpose of housing persons, machinery,
equipment or supplies. This category includes all construction of such
structures, the installation of equipment, as well as incidental grading and
paving. Such structures need not be “habitable” to be building construction.
Examples of “building” construction projects are auditoriums, city halls,
apartment buildings (five stories and above), hospitals, office buildings,
schools, warehouses, and shopping centers.</p><p>Residential: Single family
houses or apartment buildings of four stories or less.</p><p>Highway: Alteration or
repair of roads, streets, highways, runways, alleys, trails, paths, parking
areas, and other similar projects not incidental to building or heavy
construction.</p><p>Heavy: This is a catch-all
category. It includes all other projects not classified as building, highway or
residential (e.g. bridges over navigable waters, dams, dredging and irrigation
projects, tunnels). Of the four categories of construction, this is the only
type of construction that can be broken into subcategories such as water and
sewer line projects and dredging projects. </p><p>A project which includes
elements of two or more types of construction normally requires multiple wage
determinations if such category of construction is “substantial” (i.e. greater
than 20% of project costs or greater than $1,000,000). </p><p>(c)   General wage determinations.</p><p>General WDs are published at

              <h3>15f03 - Use and effectiveness of wage
determinations.</h3>
              <p>(a)   General WDs contain no expiration date. Once issued,
they remain valid until modified, superseded, or canceled. They may be used by
the contracting agency, without prior notification to DOL, in contracts to be
performed within the specified geographical area and for the types of
construction designated in the WD.</p><p>(b)  Project WDs are effective for 180 calendar days from
the date they are issued. If the contract for which a project WD is requested
is not awarded within the 180 days before the WD expires, the contracting
agency must request a new WD or obtain an extension of the expiration date from
the Administrator. A project WD is applicable only to the particular project
for which it was initially requested; it may not be included by the contracting
agency in any other construction contracts.</p><p>(c)   Modifications to general and project WDs, notice of
which are published in web site http://www.wdol.gov or received by the
contracting agency less than 10 days before bid opening, but not after bid
opening, are effective unless the agency finds there is not sufficient time to
notify bidders of the change. (See 29 CFR § 1.6(c).)</p><p>(d)  In addition, 29 CFR § 1.6(c)(3)(iv) provides that if a
contract to which a general WD has been applied is not awarded within 90 days
after bid opening, any modification published prior to contract award is
effective, unless the agency obtains an extension of the 90-day period from the
Administrator. 29 CFR § 1.6(e) provides that if a bid solicitation is found to
contain a wrong WD, or if a WD is withdrawn as a result of an Administrative
Review Board decision, notification to the contracting agency of such a finding
is effective immediately, provided notification is made prior to contract
award. Further, 29 CFR § 1.6(f) provides a mechanism to require contracting
agencies to utilize a WD after award if it is found that the agency failed to
include any WD in a covered contract or used a WD which clearly does not apply
to the contract. 29 CFR § 1.6(g) contains guidelines for the application of WDs
in situations where Federal funding or assistance is not approved until after
contract award (or after start of construction where there is no contract
award).</p><p>(e)   Project or general WDs included in a contract are
effective for the life of the contract. However, contracts that contain Option
Clauses by which a contracting agency may unilaterally extend the term of the
contract require inclusion of a current WD at the time the option is exercised.

              <h3>15f05 - Area practice - determining
proper classification of various work and type of construction.</h3>
              <p>(a)   To determine the proper classification of work
performed on a Davis-Bacon covered project, it may be necessary to conduct a local
area practice survey. Under the DBA, there are not standard classification
definitions. (This differs from SCA classifications, which are defined in the
SCA Directory of Classifications.) Note: While the Dictionary of Occupational
Titles, published by the Department’s Employment and Training Administration,
may be used as reference material, it cannot be relied on for making employee
classification determinations.</p><p>(b)  The Wage Appeals Board ruled in Fry Brothers Corp.
(WAB Case No. 76-6, June 14, 1977) that the proper classification of work
performed by laborers and mechanics is that classification used by firms whose
wage rates were found to be prevailing in the area and incorporated in the
applicable wage determination. Questions as to the proper classification for
the work performed by a laborer or mechanic are resolved by making an area
practice survey. Area practice surveys can be conducted by the contracting
agencies or by WHD using the following guidelines. All Agency Memorandums
(AAMs) Nos. 130 and 131 provide guidance regarding the proper categories of the
various types of construction (building, heavy, highway and residential)
subject to “local or area practice”. Before any area practice survey is
started, the Regional Wage Specialist must be contacted. See http://www.dol.gov/whd/programs/dbra/regions.htm</p><p>(c)   Basic Principles/Preliminary Steps for Conducting
Surveys to Determine Prevailing Local Area Practice:</p><p>(1) 
Clearly define the scope of
work/duties for which proper classification is at issue.</p><p>(2) 
Refer to the wage determination in
the DB/DBRA covered contract.</p><p>(3) 
Determine what classifications may
perform the work duties in question.</p><p>(4) 
Examine the “identifiers” for each
classification to determine whether the rates in the wage determination for
each such classification reflect union negotiated or non-union wages. </p><p>                                             
a.     Non-union rates in a Davis-Bacon wage determination
are listed in a wage rate block that has an “SU” identifier, and appear in
alphabetical order in the list of classifications in the wage determination
(e.g,. after sheet metal workers and before truck drivers). Other wage
determination blocks reflect rates in collective bargaining agreements.</p><p>                                            
b.     Union rates are listed under identifiers that refer to
the union whose rates are reflected in a given wage rate block in the
Davis-Bacon wage determination. Examples are: ASBE (International Association
of Heat &amp; Frost &amp; Asbestos Workers), ELEC (International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers), PLAS (Operative Plasters and Cement Masons), and PLUM
(United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe
Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada). The number following in the
identifier usually indicates the local union number for the union that
negotiated the rates shown in the wage determination block.</p><p>(5) 
In accord with Fry Brothers Corp.,
information to be considered in the area practice survey is from firms whose
wage rates were found to be prevailing in the area and incorporated in the
applicable wage determination.</p><p>                                             
a.     If, in the applicable wage determination, the rates
listed for all the classifications that may perform the work in question are
non-union rates, the dispute will be resolved by examining the practice(s) of
non-union contractors in classifying workers performing the duties on similar
construction in question in the area (usually the same county).</p><p>                                            
b.     If, in the applicable wage determination, the rates
listed for all the classifications that may perform the work in question are
union rates, the dispute will be resolved by examining the practice(s) of union
contractors in classifying workers performing the duties in question on similar
construction in the area (usually the same county). (Often such questions can
be resolved by a limited area practice survey.)</p><p>                                             
c.     If a combination of union and non-union rates are
listed in the wage determination for classifications that may have performed
the work in question on similar construction in the area (usually the same
county), the dispute will be resolved based on the combined information from:</p><p>1.    
union contractors for the
classification(s) for which union rate(s) are listed in the applicable wage
determination; and</p><p>2.    
non-union contractors for the
classification(s) for which non-union rate(s) are listed in the applicable wage
determination.</p><p>(6) 
To ensure the local area practice
survey examines how workers who performed the duties in question were
classified when they worked on similar construction projects in the same area
as the project in question during the survey timeframe, proper classification
of the laborers or mechanics performing the work in question will be resolved
by examining the classification practice(s) of contractors who performed the
work in question on:</p><p>                                             
a.     similar construction projects – building construction,
residential construction, highway construction, heavy construction – (See AAM
# 130 &amp; 131.)</p><p>                                            
b.     that were in progress in the same area (normally the
same county.)</p><p>                                             
c.     during the year preceding the contract in question (as
discussed below).</p><p>(7) 
The extent of the information
required for making area practice determinations will depend on the facts in
each case. For example:</p><p>                                             
a.     If, in gathering preliminary data, all of the parties
agree as to the proper classification, the area practice is thus established
(i.e., a “limited” area practice survey).</p><p>                                            
b.     However, if all parties do not agree (i.e.,
jurisdictional dispute between two unions, or management does not agree with
the union, or where non-union rate(s) in the wage determination may apply and
the practice among non-union contractors in the area varies), it will be
necessary to determine by a “full” area practice survey which classification
actually performed the work in question.</p><p>                                             
c.     The survey will collect information on how workers
performing the work in question were classified on similar projects underway in
the same locality (normally the county), during the year prior to contract
award of the DBA/DBRA contract in question (or, in the case of contracts entered
intopursuant to competitive bidding procedures -- as contrasted with
negotiation procedures -- the year prior to bid opening; in the case of
projects assisted under the National Housing Act, beginning of construction or
the date the mortgage was initially endorsed, whichever occurred first; or, in
the case of projects to receive housing assistance payments under section 8 of
the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, beginning of construction or the date the
agreement to enter a housing assistance payments contract was executed,
whichever was first.)</p><p>(d)  To conduct a limited area practice survey to determine
the proper classification of work:</p><p>Follow the “preliminary
steps” described in 15f05(c), above.</p><p>(1) 
If the applicable wage
determination reflects union rates for the classifications involved:</p><p>                                             
a.     Contact the unions whose members may have performed
the work in question to determine whether the union workers performed the work
on similar projects in the county in the year prior to the wage determination
lock-in date (contract award date, or other date, as described above) for the
project at issue. </p><p>                                            
b.     The criteria for usable data is similar projects (same
type of construction), in the same county as the project in question, within
the usable time frame of one year prior to the wage determination lock-in date
for the contract in question, as established by 29 CFR § 1.6(c). </p><p>                                             
c.     If union contractors performed the work, each union
should be asked how the individuals who performed the work in question were
classified. If no union workers performed any of the work in question in the
county during the survey timeframe, the Regional WS should be contacted for
further guidance.</p><p>                                            
d.     The information provided by the unions should be
confirmed with collective bargaining representatives of management, i.e., the
contractor representatives. These would include local chapters of contractors'
associations that bargain with the unions. For example: the Associated General
Contractors of America (AGC), the National Electrical Contractors Association
(NECA), the Mechanical Contractors Association of America, etc. (Contact NO/Division
of Wage Determinations/Branch of Construction Wage Determinations for
information needed to contact the contractors’ association and the local union
that negotiated the collective bargaining agreement whose rates are reflected
in the contract wage determination.)</p><p>                                             
e.     If all parties agree as to the proper classification of
the work in question, the area practice is established. If two unions are
engaged in a jurisdictional dispute over a specific type of work and both have
performed the work in question during the applicable time period, contact
Regional WS for further guidance. (A more extensive area practice survey will
be required to resolve the question.)</p><p>NOTE: With regard to (2) and (3), below, it may be
more practical in many instances to proceed directly to a full area practice
survey if calls to the contractors are needed anyway to determine whether each
contractor is a union or open shop contractor (see information in (4) below).</p><p>(2) 
If the applicable wage
determination reflects non-union rates for the classifications involved:</p><p>                                             
a.     Contact open shop contractors (many are members of the
Associated Builders and Contractors of America (ABC)) and ask whether they
performed the work in question on similar projects underway in the county
during the survey timeframe. (While it may not be possible to know if
contractors are union or open shop contractors prior to calling them, there
would be no need to request information from the union contractors concerning
their classification practices in this case.)</p><p>1.    
If so, the non-union contractors
should be asked how the employees who performed this work were classified.</p><p>2.    
If all the non-union contractors
agree, or if a clear majority of them agree, the area practice is established.</p><p>3.    
If no open shop contractor
performed the work at issue in the county during the survey timeframe, contact
the Regional WS for further guidance.</p><p>(3) 
If the applicable wage
determination reflects a mix of union and non-union rates for the
classifications involved:</p><p>                                             
a.     Contact the unions, and contact union and open shop
contractors (and/or their associations) to determine who performed the work at
issue on similar projects during the survey timeframe.</p><p>1.    
If all parties agree, or if a
clear majority of the parties (both union contractors regarding the classification
listed with a union rate in the wage determination and non-union contractors
regarding the classification listed with a non-union rate in the wage
determination) agree on the classification, the area practice is established.</p><p>2.    
Contact the Regional WS if no work
of the type at issue was performed in the county during the applicable time
frame discussed above.</p><p>(4) 
For any type of wage determination
(whether based on union rates, non-union rates, or a mixed schedule): If the
parties contacted in the limited area practice survey do not agree (i.e.,
jurisdictional dispute between the unions, management does not agree with union,
or disagreement between the open shop contractors), or if there is no clear
majority in agreement, then it is necessary to contact the Regional WS and
prepare to conduct a full area practice survey.</p><p>(e)   How to conduct a full area practice survey to
determine the proper classification of work:</p><p>Follow the “preliminary steps” described in 15f05(c),
above.</p><p>(1) 
Identify similar projects in the same
geographical area as the project under investigation (usually the county) which
were in progress during the period one year prior to the wage determination
lock-in date of the contract involved in the dispute/investigation. If no
similar projects were built in the area during that time frame, contact the
Regional WS for advice in expanding the survey's geographic scope and/or its
time frame. (Note: where data regarding the classification practices of union
contractors are sought in the area practice survey, it may be appropriate to
request a list of contractors who may have performed the work in question from
the relevant union(s) and use such list(s) to contact the contractors as a way
to identify relevant projects.)</p><p>(2) 
Identify firms that performed the work
in question on these projects and determine those from which data should be
collected based on whether the relevant classifications in question in the wage
determination are either non-union rates, union rates, or both. (For example, if
only non-union wage rates in the wage determination are involved, information
from union contractors is not relevant; if only union rates are involved,
information from open shop contractors is not relevant. Similarly, if the
classifications in the wage determination that may have performed the work in
question are a mix of union and non-union rates, information from both union
and open shop contractors will need to be collected, but data from union
contractors cannot be used to support the non-union rate and data from open
shop contractors cannot be used to support the union classification rate.)</p><p>(3) 
For each project, obtain data from
the week in which the greatest number of employees performed the work in
question, and record how many performed such work on each project and how such
employees were classified and paid.</p><p>(4) 
Compile all relevant information
received and total the number of employees who performed the work in question
in each classification reported. The data should be tallied separately for
union and non-union contractors/workers – only data from union
contractors/workers can be counted to support a union rate listed in the
contract wage determination, and only data from open shop contractors can be
counted to support a non-union rate in the wage determination.</p><p>                                             
a.     The classification which has the clear majority of
employees performing the work in question is the proper classification.</p><p>                                            
b.     If the data does not show that at least 60% of the
workers who performed the duties in question were classified in the same classification,
contact the Regional WS for further guidance.</p>

              <p>In many cases salaried
employees perform work on DBRA covered projects and noncovered projects in the
same w/w. To determine whether the employee has been properly paid for the time
spent on the DBRA project, it is first necessary to determine the hourly rate
of pay. For example, an employee who is working 40 hours per week and paid a salary
of $600.00 per week would be paid at the rate of $15.00 per hour. If this same
employee is entitled to a prevailing rate of $19.50 per hour for DBRA covered
work, he or she would be entitled to an additional $4.50 per hour for work
performed on the DBRA project. An employer may not arbitrarily allocate a
greater portion of the employee’s salary to DBRA work in order to achieve
compliance with the Act. It should be kept in mind that a nonexempt (i.e., 29
CFR Part 541) salaried employee is only due the applicable DBRA rate for those
hours actually spent performing laborers’ and mechanics’ duties. (See 29 CFR §
5.2(m) and FOH 15e15(b).)</p>

reduce the employee’s regular rate of pay of $15.00 per hour on nongovemment
work to offset the higher rate required under DBRA This same principle applies
where an employee performs work in more than one DBRA classification; an
employee may be paid not less than the specified WD rate for each of the actual
hours worked in each classification (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(i)).</p>

payments.</h3>
              <p>(a)   29 CFR § 5.5(a)(l)(i) and FAR § 52.222-6(b)(2) require
that contributions to fringe benefit plans made by a contractor or
subcontractor must be made on a regular basis, i.e., not less often than
quarterly.</p><p>(b)  Normally, contributions made to a fringe benefit plan
for Government work generally may not be used to fund the plan for periods of
non-government work. (See also FOH 15f12(b).)</p><p>(c)   A contractor must make payments or incur costs in the
amount specified in the applicable WD for each individual laborer or mechanic
performing covered contract work. Where the cash wages paid and the per hour
cost equivalents for fringe benefits together do not equal the sum of the
prevailing wage rate and fringe benefit amounts set forth in the applicable WD,
the balance due must be paid in cash to each of the employees underpaid. NOTE:
Where a fringe benefit includes a percentage, compliance will be achieved by
computation of the percentage stated times the basic wage rate.</p><p>(d)  Contractors and subcontractors are required to pay
fringe benefits for all DBRA covered work in the w/w. Unlike SCA, fringe
benefits for D-B must be paid for both ST and OT hours. However, fringe benefit
payments are not included in the basic/regular rate of pay for CWHSSA OT
purposes. (See also FOH l5k06.)</p><p>(e)   A contractor may take credit for contributions for any
“bona fide” fringe benefits regardless of whether the particular benefit is
listed on the applicable WD.</p><p>(f)   The contractor is under no obligation to obtain the
employee’s concurrence before contributing to the fringe benefit plan on his or
her behalf.</p><p>(g)   Fringe benefits must be “bona fide”. There is no
difficulty in determining whether a particular fringe benefit is “bona fide” in
the ordinary case where the benefits are those common to the construction
industry and which are paid directly to the employees in cash or into a fund,
plan or program. An example of the latter would be the types of benefits listed
in the Act itself which are funded under a trust or insurance program.
Contractors may take credit for contributions made under such conventional
plans without requesting the approval of DOL under 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(1)(iv).</p><p>(h)  Where a particular fringe benefit or benefit plan is
not of the conventional type described in the preceding paragraph (f), it will
be necessary for the NO to examine the facts and circumstances involved to
determine whether the fringe benefit or the plan is “bona fide” in accordance
with the requirements of the Act. This is particularly true with respect to
unfunded plans, which are discussed in 29 CFR § 5.28. Contractors or
subcontractors seeking credit under the Act for costs incurred for such plans
must request specific permission from W-H under 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(l)(iv).</p><p>A contractor may not take
credit for any benefit required by law, such as social security contributions
or workers compensation.</p>

              <h3>15f12 - Computing hourly fringe
benefit equivalents.</h3>
              <p>(a)   In determining cash equivalent credit for fringe
benefit payments, the period of time to be used is the period covered by the
contribution. For example, if an employer contributes to a hospitalization plan
on a weekly basis, the total hours worked (DBRA covered and noncovered) each
week by each employee should be divided into the contribution made by the
employer on behalf of each employee to determine the hourly cash equivalent for
which the employer is entitled to take credit for each employee. If contributions
are made biweekly, cash equivalents would be computed bi-weekly. If
contributions are made quarterly, cash equivalents would be computed quarterly,
etc.</p><p>(b)  On occasion, a contractor or subcontractor may offset
the annual cost of a particular fringe benefit by converting such costs to an
hourly cash equivalent. For example, the hourly cash equivalent may be
determined by dividing the cost of the fringe benefit by the total number of
working hours (DBRA and noncovered) to which the cost is attributable. Total
hours worked by employees must be used as a divisor to determine the rate of
contribution per hour, since employees may work on both DBRA and nongovernment
work during the year and employers are prohibited from using contributions made
for nongovernment work to discharge or offset their obligations on DBRA work
(see FOH 15f11(b)). Note, however, that if the amount of contribution varies
per employee, credit must be determined separately for the amount contributed
on behalf of each employee (FOH 15f11(c)).</p><p>(c)   To illustrate the principles set out in (b), assume
that the annual cost of a pension program is $15,000. The total actual working
hours (DBRA and nongovernment) are 15,000. Thus $15,000 / 15,000 hours = $1.00
per hour cash equivalent. Since construction workers often do not work a full
year (2,080 hours), where the contractor makes annual payments in advance to cover
the coming year and actual hours worked will not be determinable until the
close of that year, the total hours worked by the DBRA-covered laborers,
mechanics and apprentices, if any, for the preceding calendar year (or plan
year), will be considered as representative of a normal work year for purposes
of the above formula. Similarly, where the contractor pays monthly health
insurance premiums in advance on a lump sum basis, the total actual hours
worked in the previous month or in the same month in the previous year may be
use to determine (i.e., estimate) the hourly equivalent credit per employee
during the current month. Any representative period may be utilized in such
cases, provided that the period selected is reasonable. Where the cost incurred
included contributions for employees other than covered laborers, mechanics,
and apprentices, the hours of such noncovered employees must be included in the
computation of the hourly cash equivalent or the contributions for such
employees must be eliminated prior to determining the cash equivalent for
covered employees.</p><p>(d)  In computing cash equivalents, it should be kept in
mind that under certain kinds of fringe benefit plans the rate of contribution
for employees may vary. For example, under a hospitalization plan the employer
often contributes at different rates for single and family plan members. In
such situations, an employer cannot take an across the board average equivalent
for all employees; rather, the cash equivalent can only be credited based on
the rate of contributions for each individual employee.</p>

              <h3>15f13 - Eligibility standards for
participation in fringe benefit plans.</h3>
              <p>Eligibility standards are
permissible in an otherwise “bona fide” fringe benefit plan under DBRA.
However, an employer must make payments or incur costs in the applicable
specified amounts with respect to each individual laborer or mechanic
performing covered contract work. Employees who are excluded from a plan for
whatever reason and for whom the employer makes no contribution must be paid in
cash. For example, many hospitalization plans require a waiting period of 30
days before an employee can participate in the plan. Since the employer
normally makes no contribution for the employee during the waiting period, the
employee must be paid the fringe benefit in cash or furnished other bona fide
fringe benefits equal in monetary value. If the plan requires contributions to
be made during the eligibility waiting period, credit may be taken for such
contributions. Since it is not required that all employees participating in a
bona fide fringe benefit plan be entitled to receive benefits from that plan at
all times, however, credit may not be taken for contributions for employees who
by definition are not eligible to participate, such as employees who are
excluded because of age or part-time employment. Similarly, employers
frequently make contributions to union fringe benefit funds for employees who
are not members of the union. If the employee cannot participate in or receive
benefits from the union fund, the employee must be paid the fringe benefits in
cash, even though the employer, by the terms of his union contract, may be
required to contribute to the union fringe benefit fund on behalf of such
employees.</p>

              <h3>15f14 - Pension and profit sharing
plans.</h3>
              <p>(a)   In order for a pension plan or a profit sharing plan
providing for pension benefits to be creditable towards meeting the prevailing
wage requirements of DBRA, the contributions must be irrevocably made to a
trustee or a third party as set forth in 29 CFR §§ 5.26 and 5.27. In accordance
with 29 CFR § 5.26, the trustees must assume the usual fiduciary
responsibilities imposed upon trustees by applicable law. However, there is no
prohibition against the contractor being a trustee of a plan.</p><p>(b)  As a general rule, contributions to profit sharing
plans providing pension benefits may not be creditable towards meeting a
contractor’s or subcontractor’s prevailing wage obligation because of the
uncertainty or discretionary nature of the contribution provisions of the plan.</p><p>Since by its nature a profit
sharing plan is only operative if there are profits, there is no guarantee that
any contributions will be made on behalf of an employee. In addition, since
contributions under such plans are normally made on an annual basis, they fail
to meet the requirement that plan contributions be made not less often than
quarterly. (29 CFR § 5.5 (a)(l)(i).)</p><p>(c)   However, credit for profit sharing that funds pension
benefit plans can be given if certain conditions are met. The contractor would
be required to contribute irrevocably to an escrow account not less often than
quarterly, during the period of the DBRA covered work, an amount sufficient to
meet any claimed fringe benefit credit under DBRA for pensions on behalf of
each employee participating in the plan. Upon the annual determination of
profits, the monies placed in escrow are transferred to the pension trust fund
and used as an offset against the contractor’s obligation to employees under
the profit sharing plan. Allowable credit under DBRA would be limited to the
contributions made which cover that portion of the total hours worked by the
employees during the year which is attributable to work covered by DBRA Any
shortfall in profits which results in actual payments to the pension plan being
less than the rate at which the contractor claimed DBRA credit throughout the
year would have to be made up by the contractor when the account is settled at
year end, by paying the difference (shortfall) in cash directly to the
employees, or by making additional contributions to the pension fund in an
amount to cover the shortfall. A contractor cannot claim credit for more than
the actual costs of, or payments made into, the plan.</p><p>(d)  “Vesting” is a usual provision of a pension plan which
requires that an employee must work a specified period of time before he has
earned the right to the pension benefits provided in the plan. It is WHD’s
position that such provisions are permissible under the Act if they meet the
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).</p><p>(e)   “Forfeitures” are fringe benefit monies which have
been contributed on behalf of terminated, nonvested participants who have been
terminated prior to having “vested” in the plan. Pension and profit sharing
plans normally contain provisions for the disposition of forfeitures. Such
provisions provide that forfeitures are to be used to reduce a contractor’s
future contributions or are allocated to the remaining employees’ accounts. In
either case, such provisions are not prohibited under the Davis-Bacon Act.
However, the contractor may not use such forfeitures as a credit toward meeting
the requirements of an applicable Davis-Bacon wage determination. To do so
would allow the contractor to take double credit for the same contributions.</p><p>(f)    </p><p>(1) 
For defined contribution pension
plans that provide for a higher hourly rate of contributions to be made for DBRA
work than for noncovered work, the higher rate paid for DBRA work will be fully
credited only if the plan provides for immediate participation and immediate or
essentially immediate vesting schedules (e.g., 100% vesting after an employee
works 500 or fewer hours). In addition, if the employer wishes the plan to
qualify for tax exempt status, the amount of annual contributions may not
exceed a limitation imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p>(2) 
For all defined benefit pension
plans and defined contribution pension plans which do not provide for immediate
or essentially immediate vesting schedules (100% vesting after an employee works
500 or fewer hours), Davis-Bacon credit for contributions made to the plan is
allowed based on the effective annual rate of contributions for all hours
worked during the year. In other words, if a contractor wishes to receive $2.00
per hour credit for pension plan contributions, the contractor must contribute
at this same rate for all hours worked during the year. If this is not done,
the credit for DBRA purposes would have to be revised accordingly.</p><p>(3) 
For example, assume that a firm’s
contributions for the pension benefit were computed to be $2,000.00 a year for
a particular employee. If that employee worked 1,500 hours of the year on a
DBRA covered project and 500 hours of the year on another job not covered by
DBRA, only $1500 or $1.00 per hour would be creditable towards meeting the
firm’s obligation to pay the prevailing wage on the DBRA project This method
for determining the allowable D-B credit for fringe benefit payments results
from the fact that employers are prohibited from using contributions made for
work covered by DBRA to fund the plan for periods of non-DBRA work, except as
stated in (g)(2) above.</p>

              <h3>15f15 - Vacation and sick leave
plans.</h3>
              <p>(a)   It has been found that many vacation and sick leave
plans in the construction industry are generally unfunded plans within the
meaning of 29 CFR § 5.28. 29 CFR § 5.28 provides that an unfunded fringe
benefit plan will be considered to be a bona fide plan for Davis-Bacon purposes
if the plan 1) reasonably can be anticipated to provide benefits described in
the D-B Act; 2) represents a commitment that can be legally enforced, 3) is
carried out under a financially responsible plan or program; and 4) has been communicated
in writing to the affected employees. To insure that such plans are not used to
avoid compliance with the Act, the S/L directs the contractor to set aside, in
an account, sufficient assets to meet the future obligation of the plan. At the
time the employee takes vacation or sick leave the monies in such an account
could be distributed and used as an offset against the vacation and sick leave
plan obligation of the contractor. However, if a contractor has paid vacation
or sick leave “out of pocket” under an unfunded plan, credit must be given for
such payments (see (d) below).</p><p>(b)  If an employee should terminate prior to becoming
eligible under a vacation or sick leave plan, and amounts have been paid into
an account on such employee’s behalf for which the contractor has taken credit
towards meeting its prevailing wage obligations, then the employee must be paid
those amounts from the account upon termination.</p><p>(c)   Situations may be encountered where unused vacation
and/or sick leave is forfeited upon termination of employment. In such cases,
the per hour cost of the vacation and/or sick leave credit must be computed on
the basis of the total cost of the vacation and/or sick leave actually used by
each employee (i.e., forfeited contributions for which the contractor has
claimed credit under DBRA may not revert to the contractor). Of course, if the
employer pays these accumulated benefits in cash upon termination by an
employee, there will be no problem in determining the cash equivalent.</p><p>(d)  In order to determine the DBRA credit for vacation and
sick leave, the payments made by the contractor to each employee are divided by
the hours worked in the period covered by the payments. Since both sick leave
and vacation are generally annual type fringe benefits, the total hours worked
during the year (government and non-government) should be used as the divisor.
For example, let us assume an employee was paid $1500.00 for vacation benefits
and worked a total of 1500 hours for the employer during the year. The employer
would be entitled to a credit of $1.00 per hour against the DBRA prevailing
wage ($1500 /1500 hours).</p>

              <h3>15f17 - Crediting apprentice training
costs.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Costs incurred by a contractor or subcontractor for a
“bona fide” apprenticeship program (i.e., a program registered with either a
State apprenticeship agency recognized by ETA (OA) or by ETA (OA) itself) are
creditable under DBRA. Only the actual costs incurred for the training program,
such as instruction, books, and tools or materials, may be credited. Where the
costs incurred exceed the amounts set forth in the applicable WD, the excess
cost may be credited towards the contractor’s or subcontractor’s other
prevailing wage obligations, but only to the extent of the actual costs of the
program.</p><p>(b)  The cost incurred for apprenticeship training for one
classification of laborer or mechanic may not be used to offset costs required
to be incurred for another classification. For example, a contractor cannot
claim credit for apprenticeship training costs incurred for electricians to
satisfy the applicable WD apprentice training requirements for carpenters.</p><p>(c)   Rather than contributing to apprenticeship training
funds on an hourly basis, some contractors contribute a lump sum in advance for
the annual cost of the program. It is permissible for a contractor to use such
a method of payment and the contractor should be given appropriate credit. For
example, a contractor may contribute a fee of $900 to enroll an employee in an
apprentice training program for carpenters. In order to determine the amount
the contractor may offset to meet this contribution, it is necessary to convert
the contribution to an hourly cash equivalent. The hourly cash equivalent would
be determined by dividing the cost by the total number of hours worked by
carpenters and carpenter apprentices (DBRA and nongovernment work) to which the
cost is attributable. Since construction workers often do not work a full year
(2,080 hours) the total hours worked by the contractor’s carpenters and
carpenter apprentices, if any, for the preceding calendar year will be
considered as representative of a normal work year for purposes of the above
formula. The hourly cash equivalent thus obtained would be the contractor’s
permissible offset on DBRA covered work. In addition, the contractor’s cost may
not be offset over a period longer than the training period the cost was
intended to cover. Thus, in this example, if the total hours worked by
carpenters and carpenters’ apprentices were 45,000 hours in the preceding
calendar year, the contractor would be entitled to a credit of $0.02 per hour
($900 / 45,000) against the prevailing wage obligations for all carpenters and
carpenters’ apprentices working on the DBRA project.</p>

general.</h3>

compensation of covered employees at premium rates for overtime hours of work.
The scope of CWHSSA is set out in Sec. 103 of the Act. The safety standards
provisions are administered by OSHA. Except as otherwise provided, the Act
applies the maximum hours standards of 40 hours per week to any contract which
may require or involve the employment of laborers or mechanics upon a public
work of the United States, any territory, or the District of Columbia, and to
any other contract which may require or involve the employment of laborers or
mechanics if such contract is one:</p><p>(1) 
to which the United States or any
Agency or instrumentality thereof, or any territory, or the District of
Columbia is a party; or</p><p>(2) 
which is made for or on behalf of
the United States, any agency or instrumentality thereof, any territory, or the

which is a contract for work
financed in whole or in part by loans or grants from, or loans insured or
guaranteed by, the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof,
under any statute of the United States providing wage standards for such work.
(But see FOH 15i00(1).)</p><p>Guards and “watchmen” and
many other classes of service employees are laborers or mechanics within the

              <p>(a)   Post exchanges are considered agencies of the United
States for purposes of the CWHSSA. The fact that individuals are supplying the
funds in payment for services rendered does not preclude coverage. Thus,
contracts between Post Exchanges and various concessionaires such as barber
shops, photographic studios, snack bars, shops repairing shoes, radios,
watches, TV sets and appliances, car washing racks, operators of officer clubs,
and laundry and dry cleaning services, would be subject to CWHSSA.</p><p>(b)  Where the amount of a contract other than a
construction contract exceeds $100,000, the CWHSSA applies even though the
percentage paid the Government has the effect of reducing the net amount
retained by the contractor to a figure of less than $100,000 (for example,
where the contractor pays a post exchange a percentage of the amount collected
for cleaning etc, rather than receiving payment from the Government). (See also
FOH 15i00(7))</p><p>(c)   The application of the CWHSSA to concessionaire
contracts extends to contracts under which services are provided to the public
generally, and is not limited to those contracts under which services are
provided to the Government or its civilian or military personnel. For example,
all laborers or mechanics employed by concessionaires in national park,
forests, and the National Wildlife Refuge System, are covered by CWHSSA.</p>

perform it with State or municipal employees. The CWHSSA does not contain an
exemption for contracts performed by State or municipal employees. Thus, the

the Act (Sec. 103(a) and (b)) or by administrative order issued by authority of

statutory):</p><p>(a)   work under a contract described in FOH l5g00(3) where

in that nature of a loan guarantee, or insurance (see FOH l5i01(b));</p><p>(b)  contracts for transportation by land, air, or water

articles ordinarily available in the open market;</p><p>(e)   work required to be done in accordance with the
provisions of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act;</p><p>(f)   construction contracts of $100,000 or less;</p><p>(g)   purchases and contracts, other than construction, in
the aggregate amount of $100,000 or less. In arriving at the aggregate amount
involved, there must be included all property and services which would properly
be grouped together in a single transaction and which would be included in a
single advertisement for bids if the procurement were being effected by formal
advertising.</p><p>(h)  agreements entered into by or on behalf of the
Commodity Credit Corporation for storage in, or handling by, commercial
warehouses of certain items, including grains, beans, seeds, cotton, wool and
naval stores;</p><p>(i)    certain sales of surplus power by TVA; and</p><p>(j)    contract work performed in a work place within a

              <h3>15i01 - Application of exclusions and
exemptions under CWHSSA.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The CWHSSA provides in part that the Act applies if
the contract is “for work financed in whole or in part by loans or grants from,
or loans insured or guaranteed by,&quot; the United States or any agency or
instrumentality thereof under any federal law providing wage standards for the
work. 40 U.S.C. § 3701(b)1(B)(iii). Thus, coverage on Federally assisted contracts
does not exist unless the particular statute under which the loans or grants
are authorized contains wage standards, directly or by reference. For example,
contracts awarded as a result of a grant from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, under the Watershed Protection and
Flood Prevention Act (16 USCA § 1001, et seq.) are not covered by CWHSSA since
the basic statute contains no reference to wage standards.</p><p>(b)  40 U.S.C. §3701) also provides that 40 U.S.C. §3702 (labor
standards and wage and liquidated damages liabilities) shall not apply “to work
where the assistance described in [40 U.S.C. § 3701(b)1(B)(iii)] from the Government
or an agency or instrumentality is only in a loan guarantee, or insurance”.
(Emphasis added.) This is a limited partial exemption from the application of
CWHSSA confined to work assisted only in the quoted manner. It applies even
though CWHSSA stipulations are written into the contract, but it does not
affect DBRA application under the wage standards provided in the enabling
statute. Particular attention should be paid to Department of Housing and Urban
Development projects since the assistance for many of these projects is only in
the nature of a loan guarantee, or insurance.</p><p>(c)   With respect to contracts involving transportation, it
is necessary to distinguish carefully as to whether the contract is primarily
for transportation purposes or whether the transportation is merely incidental
to some other purpose of the contract. For example, mail haul contracts are for
the primary purpose of transportation; hauling of materials by a contractor in
connection with its construction contract is an incident to the primary purpose
of the contract, which is construction, not transportation.</p><p>(d)  The “open market” exemption in CWHSSA is much broader
than the exemption in PCA. While in PCA the “open market” exemption is directed
at the mode of purchase, in the CWHSSA the determination of whether a purchase
is an “open market” one depends on the character of the products or article
purchased. If the contract is for the purchase of materials in the form in
which they are ordinarily made available to the general purchasing public, the
CWHSSA “open market” exemption applies.</p><p>(e)   Laborers or mechanics (including “watchmen” and
guards) engaged in performance of government contracts for supplies that are
not ordinarily available in the “open market” (see (d) above) are covered by
CWHSSA if and to the extent that the work which they perform is not required to
be done in accordance with the provisions of PCA. If a contract in excess of
$100,000 is in part for services and in part for materials, a laborer or
mechanic performing the services may be subject to CWHSSA, and another
employee, engaged in producing the materials, may be subject only to PCA.</p>

mechanics, guards and “watchmen” for the time spent on covered contract work
only (i.e., total up all time each employee spent working on covered contracts
- exclude all commercial, non-government work). CWHSSA requires the payment of
time and one-half the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40

              <h3>15k01 - Basic rate of pay.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The CWHSSA contains no MW standards; MW standards
result from the application of DBRA prevailing wage rate determinations, SCA
prevailing wage rate determinations, or the FLSA MW. The basic rate of pay
under CWHSSA is the straight time hourly rate and cannot be less than the basic
hourly rate required in an applicable wage determination. Under DBRA, amounts
paid as fringe benefits – both contributions to bona fide benefit plans and
cash payments made to meet wage determination fringe benefits requirements –
are excluded in computing overtime obligations under CWHSSA.</p><p>(b)  If an employee worked in more than one classification
and at different rates on covered contracts during a workweek, the overtime
premium is computed based on the regular rate of pay. The regular rate is the
weighted average of the rates; that is, the total earnings (except statutory
exclusions) at the different rates are divided by the total number of hours
worked in the w/w. Overtime may be computed based on the rate in effect during
the hours worked over 40 in the workweek provided the provisions of FLSA §
7(g)(1) or (2) are met. (See 29 CFR §§ 778.6, 778.115 and 778.415-419.)</p>

              <h3>15k03 - Hours worked.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The principles governing the determination of what
constitutes working time for purposes of the FLSA are followed in determining
hours worked by laborers and mechanics performing work subject to CWHSSA.
However, the application of the OT provisions under the CWHSSA differs from the
FLSA in that only the hours actually spent on a covered contract or combination
of covered contracts need be considered in computing the OT pay.</p><p>(b)  In the case of an employee working for two or more
employers, all hours worked under the same contract are to be counted for
purposes of CWHSSA OT even though the employers are disassociated or otherwise
separate, such as a contractor and a subcontractor.</p><p>(c)   An employee working for the same contractor on two or
more separately awarded contracts subject to the CWHSSA is entitled to have the
hours worked on all such covered contracts combined and to receive OT for all
such hours worked in the w/w in excess of 40.</p><p>(d)  When an employee performs two or more types of work
for which different hourly rates are applicable (i.e., different
classification, DBRA or SCA work which is all covered by CWHSSA or noncovered work,
etc.), the CWHSSA overtime premium is computed under FLSA principles (FOH 32b05
and 32h).</p><p>(e)   CWHSSA does not have a site of work limitation on
coverage. All hours worked on covered contracts (even at a fabrication shop
away from the site) are combined for determining CWHSSA compliance. (For
example: if an employee starts the day performing covered work at the
fabrication shop and then travels to the work site, the time at the fabrication
shop and the travel time between the fabrication shop and the work site is
hours worked covered by CWHSSA.)</p>

              <h3>15k04 - Computation of OT when other
premium payments are involved.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Employees may receive an additional premium payment
for employees performing hazardous, arduous, or dirty work. Such premium
payments are not creditable as premium OT work and must be included as part of
the basic or regular rate in computing OT under the CWHSSA in the same manner
as under the FLSA. On the other band, where the parties have agreed on premium
rates for work qualifying as OT under FLSA Sections 7(e)(5), (6), or (7) which
are computed as a multiple of the base rate specified by the agreement, the
extra compensation paid for such OT which is in excess of the statutory
“regular rate” may be credited, under Section 7(h) of the FLSA, toward the 50
percent premium compensation for OT which is required by the Act’s provision
for an OT rate of “not less than one and one-half times” the statutory “regular
rate”. A like rule applies under the CWHSSA.</p><p>(b)  For example, an agreement provides for a rate of pay
of $13 an hour for a crane operator with double-time for work in excess of 8
hours/day or 40 hours a week. A crane operator works 9 hours a day 5 days a
week. Under the agreement, the crane operator is entitled to $585 (45 x $13) in
straight time compensation and $65 (5 x $13 for agreed double-time OT rate) in
OT compensation for a total of $650. The OT premium due under the FLSA is
$32.50 (5 hours x .5 x $13) and the employer paid $65. Since the employee
received a creditable premium, the employee is paid in compliance.</p><p><b>(c)   </b>For another example assume the same employee works
under an agreement that provides a rate of $12 an hour for a crane operator,
with double time based on such rate for work in excess of 8 hours a day or 40
hours a week and an additional $1 an hour for a crane with a boom length of
over 275 feet. Under the agreement, an operator of a crane with such a boom
length who works 9 hours a day, 5 days a week is entitled to $645 for the week
($480 for 40 hours at $12, plus $45 for 45 hours long-boom rate of $1, plus
$120 for 5 OT hours at $24,). If paid in accordance with such an agreement the
employee is paid in compliance with the FLSA and the CWHSSA. Under both Acts,
the “regular rate” or “basic rate” is $13 an hour, which includes the $1 per
hour for the long-boom time. An additional payment of not less than $6.50 an
hour as extra compensation for weekly OT is required for 5 of the 45 hours
worked (5 x 6.50 = $32.50 required OT premium). Thus, the statutory
requirements are met by payment of $60 (5 hours x $12 agreed double-time OT
premium rate).The agreed double-time OT payment which is creditable (5 x $12 =
$60) is more than enough to satisfy the statutory OT pay requirement (5 x $6.50
= $32.50).</p>
