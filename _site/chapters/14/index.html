              <p>The SCA (41 U.S.C. § 351, et
seq.) applies to every contract entered into by the United States or the
District of Columbia, the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in
the United States through the use of service employees. Contractors performing
on such Federal service contracts in excess of $2,500 must observe minimum wage
and safety and health standards, and maintain certain records. Service
employees on covered contracts in excess of $2,500 must be paid not less than
the monetary wages and fringe benefits contained in wage determinations issued
by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) for the contract work. Such wage and
fringe benefit determinations may reflect what has been determined to be
prevailing in the locality, or may reflect the wage rates and fringe benefits
contained in the predecessor contractor’s collective bargaining agreement (CBA),
if any, pursuant to Section 4(c) of the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R. Part 4.)</p>

              <p>The FLSA (29 U.S.C. § 201,
et seq.) prescribes standards for the basic minimum wage and overtime pay that
may affect SCA-covered contracts. The FLSA interacts with the SCA in three key
ways:</p><p>(a)   Section 2(b)(1) of the SCA provides that no contractor
or subcontractor shall pay any employee engaged in performing work on a covered
contract less that the minimum wage specified under Section 6(a)(1) of the
FLSA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.159.) </p><p>(b)  Section 8(b) of the SCA defines the term &quot;service
employee&quot; as any person engaged in the performance of a contract or that
portion of a contract subject to the SCA except those employees in bona fide
executive, administrative, or professional capacities as those terms are
defined in the FLSA regulations found at 29 C.F.R. Part 541. (See 41 U.S.C.
357(b); 29 C.F.R. 4.113.)</p><p>(c)   Section 6 of the SCA recognizes that other Federal
laws, such as the FLSA, may require overtime compensation to be paid to service
employees working on or in connection with contracts subject to the SCA. (See
41 U.S.C. 355; SCA, 29 C.F.R. 4.180-4.182; FLSA 29 C.F.R. Part 778.)</p>

to service employees working on or in connection with contracts subject to the

              <p>(a)   Absent an exemption under Sections 4(b) or 7 of the
Act, Section 2(a) mandates that every contract entered into by any agency or
instrumentality of the United States or the District of Columbia in excess of
$2,500, the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in the United
States through the use of service of employees, must contain:</p><p>(1) 
Specified minimum monetary wages
(MWs) and fringe benefits (FBs) determined by the Secretary of Labor (S/L) that
are based upon wage rates and fringe benefits prevailing in the locality (or,
in certain circumstances, the wage rates and fringe benefits contained in a
collective bargaining agreement, if any, applicable to employees who performed
on a predecessor contract) to be paid to the various classes of service
employees employed by the contractor or any subcontractor in performance of the
contract or subcontract;</p><p>(2) 
A requirement that working
conditions provided by or under the control of the contractor or subcontractor
meet safety and health standards; </p><p>(3) 
A requirement that notice be given
to service employees on the day they commence work of the compensation due them
under the minimum wage and fringe benefit provisions of the contract (or that
such notice be posted in a prominent place at the worksite); and</p><p>(4) 
A statement of the wage rates and
fringe benefits that would be paid by the contracting agency to the various
classes of service employees if such employees were hired directly by the
agency to perform the contract work. This statement is included in contracts
for informational purposes only. </p><p>(b)  The remaining sections of the SCA direct DOL to
administer and enforce the Act, and give no authority to contracting agencies
to issue final coverage determinations. DOL must ultimately decide any issue
concerning coverage under the SCA. (See 41 U.S.C. 351 et seq.; 29 C.F.R.

              <h3>14b01 - Coverage – general.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The SCA applies to contracts entered into by the
United States or the District of Columbia, the principal purpose of which is to
furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.107-4.114.)</p><p>(b)  Specifications for services in a contract which is not
as a whole principally for services are not subject to the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.111(a).)</p><p>(c)   Contracts for services which are performed essentially
by employees that qualify for exemption as bona fide executive, administrative,
or professional employees under the FLSA and involve only a minor or incidental
use of service employees would not require application of the SCA. (See SCA 29
C.F.R 4.113(a)(3); FLSA 29 C.F.R. Part 541.) </p><p>(d)  The term “contractor” as used in the contract clauses
required by the SCA also applies to any subcontractors. When a contractor
undertakes a contract subject to the SCA, the contractor agrees to assume the
obligations that the labor standards will be observed in furnishing the
required services. These obligations may not be relieved by shifting all or
part of the work to another, and the prime contractor is jointly and severally
liable with any subcontractor for any underpayments that constitute a violation
of the prime contract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.114.)</p>

specification therefor) “entered into by the United States or the District of
Columbia,” and Section 2(b) applies to contracts entered into “with the Federal
Government.” Within the meaning of these provisions, contracts entered into by
the United States and contracts with the Federal government include all
contracts to which any agency or instrumentality of the United States
Government becomes a party. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.107.)</p><p>(b)  Contracts of the District of Columbia include all
contracts of all agencies and instrumentalities of the District which procure

              <h3>14b03 - Contracts to furnish services.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Based on the language of the SCA, if a contract is
“entered into” by or with the Government, and if its principal purpose is “to
furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees,” it
is subject to the SCA. (See 41 U.S.C. § 351(a).) </p><p>(b)  The SCA is intended to be applied to a wide variety of
service contracts. To illustrate this point, the SCA regulations provide a
listing of examples of contracts that have been found to come within its
coverage. (See 29 C.F.R. § 4.130(a).) </p><p>(c)   The nomenclature, type, or particular form of contract
used is not determinative of SCA coverage. Contracts can be in writing, the
result of competitive bidding, awarded on a cost plus basis to a single source
(“sole” source), a purchase order, or a telephone call to a contractor. (See 29
C.F.R. § 4.111(a).)</p><p>(d)  Contracts do not have to involve direct services to
the government or an agency, nor do they require the expenditure of funds by an
agency. Concessionaire contracts in which the contractor provides a service to
individual personnel or the general public, for which he or she charges a fee
to the user and then remits a portion of sale receipts to the government, are
contracts for purposes of the SCA unless exempted. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.133; FOH

District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Outer Continental Shelf
lands as defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, American Samoa,
Guam, Wake Island, Eniwetok Atoll, Kwajalein Atoll, Johnston Island, Canton

base or possession within a foreign country. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.112(a).)</p><p>(c)   For contracts in which any part of the services will
be performed within the geographic limits of the United States, the SCA and
appropriate WD must be incorporated in the bid documents and contract, and the service
employees must be paid the proper SCA rates for all hours worked within these
geographic limits. Work performed outside the geographic limits of the United
States, even if pursuant to a contract for services that is performed in part
in the United States, is not subject to the requirements of the SCA. (See 29

any person engaged in the performance of a covered contract except those
persons who individually qualify for an FLSA exemption as bona fide executive,
administrative or professional employees as defined in FLSA 29 C.F.R. Part 541.
(See 41 U.S.C. 357(b); 29 C.F.R. 4.113, 4.156; FOH 14c07.)</p><p>(b)  The SCA applies to all persons who actually perform
the service work called for by a covered contract, “regardless of any
contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a contractor or
subcontractor and such person,” except those persons expressly exempted from
the definition of “service employee.” If a person is engaged in performing any service
work called for under a covered contract, such person must be paid the wage and
FBs provided under the Act, irrespective of any alleged “independent
contractor” or non-employment relationship. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.155.)</p><p>(c)   Employees who do not perform the services required by a
contract in excess of $2,500 principally for services, but whose duties are
necessary to the performance thereof, as, for example, clerical employees who
handle paper work in connection with the contract (such as billing or
payrolls), must be paid not less than the MW specified under Section 6(a)(1) of
the FLSA assuming such MW obligations apply. (See 41 U.S.C. 351(b)(1); 29

              <p>(a)   The amount of the contract is not determinative of the
Act’s coverage although the statutory requirements and the contract clauses are
different for contracts in excess of $2,500 and for contracts of a lesser
amount. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.159.)</p><p>(b)  Contracts exceeding $2,500.</p><p>In every covered contract in
excess of $2,500 or with no definite amount, the agency is required to include
the SCA labor standards contract clauses set forth in 29 C.F.R. § 4.6. In
addition to other matters, such as R/K requirements and a summary of
liabilities and penalties for violations, these clauses contain the basic
provisions of Sections 2(a)(1) through (4) of the Act relating to: payment of
prevailing MW rates, furnishing of FBs, observance of S&amp;H standards, and
notice of compensation to employees (posting). In the absence of a WD attached
to the contract specifying the prevailing rate or rates to be paid and the FBs
to be furnished, the clauses also provide that neither the prime contractor nor
any subcontractor shall pay any employees performing work on the contract less
than the MW required by Section 6(a)(1) of the FLSA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6, 4.150,
4.159.)</p><p>(c)   The labor standards contract clauses included in the
prime contract are by their terms required to be included as well in any
subcontract or any lower tier subcontract made thereunder. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.114,
4.151.)</p><p>(d)  Contracts not exceeding $2,500.</p><p>The only clause required in
Federal service contracts of $2,500 or less is the clause reflecting the basic
provisions of Section 2(b)(1) of the SCA relating to the payment of the MW
required by Section 6(a)(1) of the FLSA to employees engaged in performing work
on the contract. However, pursuant to Section 18 of the FLSA, no provision of
the FLSA shall excuse noncompliance with any federal, state or local law
establishing a MW higher than the FLSA MW. WHD staff will not interpret or
enforce any law other than those administered by the WHD, and States cannot
interpret or enforce the SCA or FLSA. (See 41 U.S.C. 351(b)(1); 29 C.F.R.
4.150; FOH 32j01.)</p><p>(e)   Determining contract amount.</p><p>The value of the contract is
determined by either the amount to be paid for the service or the amount which
the contractor receives for providing the service. For example, concession
contracts are considered to be contracts in excess of $2,500 if the
contractor's gross receipts under the contract may exceed $2,500. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.141.) </p><p>(f)   CWHSSA contract clauses.</p><p>Any federal contract in
excess of $100,000 that requires or involves the employment of “laborers” and
“mechanics,” including “watchmen” and guards, is subject to the  overtime
provisions of CWHSSA. Such contracts, which may include SCA-covered contracts
that employ many classes of service employees that fall within the terms 
“laborers” and “mechanics,” should include CWHSSA’s contract clauses set forth
in  29 C.F.R. 5.5(b). However, failure to incorporate the CWHSSA contract
clauses into a contract does not preclude CWHSSA coverage. (See SCA 29 C.F.R.
4.181(b); Davis-Bacon Act (DBA) 29 C.F.R. 5.5(b); FOH 15g02.)   </p>

might otherwise be subject to the SCA. (See 41 U.S.C. 356(1) - (7);  29 C.F.R.
4.115-4.122.)</p><p>(a)   Any contract covered by the DBA for construction,
alteration and/or repair, including painting and decorating of public buildings

where published tariff rates are in effect. (See 41 U.S.C. 356(3); 29 C.F.R. 4.118.)</p><p>(1) 
This exemption applies only to
contracts for carriage by a common carrier. A transportation service contract
is exempt only if the service is actually governed by published tariff rates in

apply to contracts for ambulance or taxicab services as they are usually not
deemed common carriers or governed by published tariff rates.</p><p>(3) 
Mail haul contracts are not exempt
because “mail” is not considered to be “freight” under Federal law.</p><p>(4) 
Contracts principally for packing,
crating, and warehousing of household goods are also not exempt (even if
performed by a “common carrier”) as the primary purpose of the contract is the
warehousing (i.e., storage) of household goods, while the local hauling is a
minor, incidental purpose of the contract. (See also FOH 14c05.)</p><p>(d)  Any contract for the furnishing of services by radio,
telephone, telegraph, or cable companies subject to the Communications Act of
1934, 47 U.S.C. 151, et seq.. (See 41 U.S.C. 356(4); 29 C.F.R. 4.119.)</p><p>(1) 
This exemption does not apply to
any contracts where such companies are furnishing other kinds of services
through the use of service employees.</p><p>(2) 
The Communications Act of 1934,
has been amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. (See P.L. 104 - 104, 47
U.S.C. 151, et seq. (1996).) </p><p>(e)   Any contract for public utility services, including
electric light and power, water, steam, and gas. (See 41 U.S.C. 356(5); 29

This exemption is applicable to
contracts for such services with companies whose rates are regulated under
federal, state, or local law governing operations of public utility
enterprises.</p><p>(2) 
Contracts covered by this
exemption include those between federal electric power marketing agencies and
investor-owned electric utilities, Rural Electrification Administration
cooperatives, municipalities, and state agencies engaged in transmission and
sale of electric power and energy.</p><p>(3) 
Contracts entered into with public
utility companies to furnish services through the use of service employees,

              <h3>14c01 - Other exemptions.</h3>
              <p>Section 4(b) of the SCA as
amended in 1972 authorizes the S/L (delegated to the Administrator) to “provide
such reasonable limitations” and to “make such rules and regulations allowing
reasonable variation, tolerances, and exemptions to and from any or all
provisions of this [Act (other than Section 10)], but only in special
circumstances where [it is determined that] such limitation, variation,
tolerance, or exemption is necessary and proper in the public interest or to
avoid the serious impairment of government business, and is in accord with the
remedial purpose of this [Act] to protect prevailing labor standards.” (See 41
U.S.C. 353(b); 29 C.F.R. 4.123.)</p><p>(a)   The following types of contracts have been exempted
from all of the provisions of the SCA pursuant to Section 4(b):</p><p>(1) 
Postal Service contracts entered
into with common carriers for the carriage of mail by rail, air (except air
star routes), bus and ocean vessel on regularly scheduled runs where the
revenue received for the carriage of the mail is insubstantial. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.123(d)(1).)</p><p>(2) 
Postal Service contracts entered
into with individual owner-operators of vehicles for transportation of mail
where it is not contemplated at the time the contract is made that the
owner-operator will hire any service employee except for brief periods of time
such as vacation, or for unexpected contingencies or emergency situations such
as illness or accident. Application of this exemption depends on conditions
existing at the time the contract is made. If the criteria for the exemption
have been met, then SCA WD requirements would not apply to anyone subsequently
engaged in the performance of the contract services during the term of the
contract for reasons within the limitations described in 29 C.F.R. 4.123(d)(2).
The term owner-operator refers to an individual, not a partnership, two closely
related individuals (“mom &amp; pop operations”), or a corporation.</p><p>(3) 
Contracts for the carriage of
freight or personnel where such carriage is subject to rates covered by Sec
10721 of the Interstate Commerce Act. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(d)(3).);</p><p>(4) 
Prime contracts and subcontracts
for the seven types of “commercial services” identified immediately below where
an employee’s work on a Government service contract represents a small portion
of time when compared to the balance of time spent on commercial work and where
additional specific criteria for exclusion from SCA coverage are satisfied.
This exemption does not apply to solicitations and contracts for any of the
seven services listed below that are: (1) entered into under the
Javits-Wagner-O’Day Act, 41 U.S.C. 47; (2) for the operation of a Government
facility or portion thereof (“GOCO” or “GOPO”) (but may apply to subcontracts);
or (3) subject to Section 4(c) of the SCA, as well as options or extensions
under contracts subject to Section 4(c) provisions. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.123(e)(2).) The seven commercial services are:</p><p>                                             
a.     Automotive (fleet of automobiles) or other vehicle
(e.g., aircraft) normal maintenance services (other than contracts to operate a
Government motor pool). (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(A).)</p><p>                                            
b.     Financial services involving the issuance and
servicing of cards (including credit cards, debit cards, purchase cards, smart
cards, and similar card services) for use by traveling Federal employees or to
make small purchases of commercial items to meet the day-to-day needs of a
Federal agency. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(B).)</p><p>                                             
c.     Contracts with hotels/motels for conferences of
limited duration (e.g., 1-5 days) that may include lodging, meals, and space
(e.g., conference rooms) as part of the contract. This exemption does not cover
contracts for lodging on an as needed or continuing basis (e.g., lodging for
military recruits or for employees attending training at a training center over
a longer period of time). (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(C).)</p><p>                                            
d.     Maintenance, calibration, repair, and/or installation
(not subject to the DBA, as provided in 29 C.F.R. 4.116(c)(2)) for all types of
equipment where the services are obtained from the manufacturer or supplier
under a contract awarded on a sole source basis. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.123(e)(2)(i)(D).)</p><p>                                             
e.     Transportation by common carrier of persons by air,
motor vehicle, rail, or marine vessel on regularly scheduled routes or via
standard commercial services (e.g., “City Pairs” contracts) (does not include
charter services). (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(E).)</p><p>                                             
f.     Real estate services, including real property
appraisal services related to housing Federal agencies or disposing of real
property owned by the Federal government. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(F).)</p><p>                                             
g.     Relocation services, including services of real estate
brokers and appraisers, to assist Federal employees or military personnel in
buying and selling homes (which shall not include actual moving or storage of
household goods and related services). (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(G).)</p><p>(b)  The following categories of service employees have a
variation to the prevailing wage requirements pursuant to Section 4(b):</p><p>(1) 
Workers with disabilities –</p><p>The SCA, like the FLSA, allows an employer to pay
apprentices, student-learners, workers with disabilities in competitive
employment, and workers with disabilities in rehabilitation facilities at
special minimum wages (SMWs) that are less than the prevailing wages required
by the WD. The SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.6(o) instructs the employer to follow the same
&quot;conditions and procedures&quot; required for the employment of such workers
as are set forth in Section 14 of the FLSA. This regulatory exception is from
the prevailing wage only. Employers are still required to pay the full FBs, or
equivalent cash payment in lieu of providing FBs, to service employees with
disabilities for the work performed. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(o)(1) and 4.152(c)(2).)
A SMW or commensurate wage will be based upon the prevailing wage listed in the
applicable SCA WD for the classification of work to be performed on the
contract. It will be determined by the individual productivity of the workers
with disabilities in proportion to the productivity of experienced workers
without disabilities who perform essentially the same type, quality, and
quantity of work. (See SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.6(o)(1); FLSA 29 C.F.R. Part 525)</p><p>(2) 
Apprentices –</p><p>Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the
SCA predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and
individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a
State apprenticeship agency that is recognized by DOL, or, if no such
recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office
of Apprenticeship, ETA, DOL. The terms and conditions of the approved program
will be followed in the employment of apprentices. Wage rates paid apprentices
must not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in
the registered program, usually expressed as a percentage of the
journeyworker’s rate in the applicable WD. The allowable ratio of apprentices
to journeyworkers employed on the contract work must not be greater than the
ratio permitted to the contractor under the registered program. Any employee
who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program must be paid the
wage rate and FBs contained in the applicable WD for the journeyworker
classification of work actually performed. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(p).)</p>

ADP equipment and office
information/word processing equipment;</p><p>(2)

listed items of equipment furnished to the government that are also furnished
commercially to the general public. The contract services must be furnished at
catalog or market prices, and the contractor must utilize the same compensation
plan for service employees performing on government work as it uses for its
employees who service such equipment for commercial customers. The contractor
must certify to all of these conditions in the contract. In addition, the
contracting officer is required to make an affirmative determination that the

“any work required to be done in accordance with the provisions the
Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act.” (See 41 U.S.C. 356(2); FOH 14c00(b).)</p><p>(b)  The regulations provide detailed guidelines for
delineating when contracts for major overhaul of equipment would be considered
“remanufacturing” subject to the PCA rather than the SCA. Complete or
substantial teardown and overhaul of heavy construction equipment, aircraft,
engines, etc., where the Government receives a totally rebuilt end item with a
new (or nearly new) life expectancy resulting from processes similar to
original manufacturing, will normally be considered “remanufacturing” subject
to the PCA so long as the work is performed in a facility owned and operated by
the contractor. Contracts for routine maintenance or repair, inspection, etc.,
continue to be subject to the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.117.)</p><p>(c)  
Contracting agencies are required
to initially determine whether work to be performed under a proposed contract
would involve principally “remanufacturing” work or service work based on the
guidelines, and incorporate the appropriate PCA or SCA labor standards clauses
into the contract prior to soliciting bids. Application of the SCA or PCA to
any type of contract not discussed in the regulations will be decided on a
case-by-case basis by the Administrator. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.117(b)(4).)</p>

or personnel must be actually governed by published tariff rates for such
carriage in order for the Section 7(3) exemption to apply. An administrative

The Section 7(3) exemption does
not apply where the principal purpose of the contract is packing, crating,
handling, loading, and/or storage of goods prior to, or following, line-haul
transportation to the ultimate destination. The fact that substantial local
drayage to and from the contractor’s establishment may also be required does
not alter the fact that the principal purpose of such a contract is other than
the carriage of freight. However, if a firm has a separate contract for
transportation subject to a published tariff rate, the Section 7(3) exemption
would apply to that contract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.118; FOH 14c00(c).)</p>

Thus, for example, the SCA will not apply to contracts for the alteration and
repair of merchant ships let by the Maritime Administration. (See 41 U.S.C.

principal purpose the procurement of a type of service where service employees

services to be performed exclusively by persons who are not service employees,
i.e., persons who qualify as bona fide executive, administrative, or
professional personnel as defined in the FLSA regulations found at 29 C.F.R.
Part 541. For example, a contract for professional services performed
essentially by bona fide professional employees, with the use of service
employees being only a minor factor in contract performance, is not covered by
the SCA. However, a contract for professional services that requires the use of
service employees to a significant or substantial extent (in terms of number of
employees or hours worked) is covered by the SCA, even though professional
employees may be used in the performance of the contract. (See 41 U.S.C.
357(b); 29 C.F.R. 4.113(a)(3), 4.156; FOH 14b05.)</p><p>(b)  In practice, a 10 to 20 percent guideline has been

(See Preamble at 48 Fed. Reg. 49736, 49743-44 (Oct. 27, 1983).)</p><p>(c)   Coverage of the Act will not extend to contracts where
it is contemplated that the services will be performed individually by the

concluding negotiations that service employees will in no event be used by the
contractor in providing the contract services. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.113(a).)</p>

              <h3>14d00 - Beneficiary of contract services – concessionaires, etc.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Where the principal purpose of a Government contract
is to furnish services through the use of service employees, the contract is
subject to the SCA regardless of who is the direct beneficiary of the services,
or the source of the funds from which the contractor is paid for the service,
and irrespective of whether the contractor performs the work in its own
establishment, on a Government installation, or elsewhere. The fact that the
contract requires or permits the contractor to provide the services directly to
individual government personnel as a concessionaire rather than through a
contracting agency does not negate SCA coverage. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.133(a).)</p><p>(b)  An administrative exemption is provided in 29 C.F.R. 4.133(b)
for certain concession contracts, such as those entered into by the National
Park Service, including National Forests and in the National Wildlife Refuge
System, which are principally for the furnishing of food, lodging, automobile
fuel, souvenirs, newspaper stands, and recreational equipment to the general
public as opposed to furnishing such services to the United States Government
or its personnel. This exemption does not affect a concession contractor’s
obligation to comply with the labor standards provisions of any other statutes
such as the CWHSSA, DBA, and FLSA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.133(b).)</p><p>(c)   Questions arise in distinguishing between a contract
whose principal purpose is the furnishing of services through the use of
service employees (subject to the SCA) and a contract which is not for the
purpose of procuring services, but rather only sets forth general conditions
under which persons desiring to transact business with individuals on Government
installations may enter and do so. Such agreements are not subject to the SCA.</p><p>(1) 
For example, where the concession
contract provides for the use of Government space or equipment on the
installation for the activity involved, or prescribes to a significant extent
conditions relating to prices, performance, and quality or type of service, the
contract would generally be considered to have as its principal purpose the
furnishing of services desired by the Government for its personnel, and be
subject to the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.133(a).)</p><p>(2) 
In contrast, SCA coverage would
not be asserted on a concession contract or agreement which merely requires a
contractor to comply with general police regulations designed to control
traffic, maintain order, and suppress nuisances. SCA coverage would not be
asserted where the requirements imposed by the contract or agreement on the
contractor are limited to such matters as restricting solicitation or pick-up
practices to specified areas on the installation, restricting hours of
operation, requiring observance of speed limits, or other rules and regulations
generally applicable to those permitted to do business on a Government
installation. Also, absent other evidence that the contract’s purpose is to
secure services, SCA coverage will not be asserted by reason of inclusion in
the contract of requirements to ensure the responsibility of the contractor
such as bonding or licensing requirements.</p>

furnish, install, stock, and service the vending machines; maintain such
machines in efficient working order; make any necessary repairs; and maintain
them in a clean, attractive, orderly and sanitary condition, the contract would
be subject to the SCA. Under such a contract, the contractor’s function is
primarily that of furnishing a service, rather than a mere sale of supplies
since it contemplates a continuing use of service employees to carry out the
contract. The question of who owns the items available from the machines at the
time a purchase is made is immaterial to the application of the SCA.</p><p>(b)  If a contractor has an agreement as described in (a)
above where a continuing use of service employees is involved, the delivery
route personnel and any employees performing any servicing of the machines
would be covered by the SCA. Additionally, it is the position of WH that the
production employees’ work involves the performance of duties necessary to the
accomplishment of the contract and such employees must be paid not less than
the MW required by Section 2(b) of the Act. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.153.)</p><p>(c)   Where the Government enters into either a leasing or
rental/purchase agreement with regard to vending machines under which the

Contracts for the maintenance and

principal purpose of the contract, which is to furnish maintenance and repair
services through the use of service employees. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.131(b).)</p><p>(2) 
Contracts to supply a Government

through the use of service employees who launder and deliver such items. (See
29 C.F.R. 4.131(c).)</p><p>(3) 
Contracts for the plowing and
reseeding of a park area are covered service contracts even though the
contractor is required to rent and furnish equipment. In general contracts
under which the contractor agrees to provide the Government with vehicles or
equipment on a rental basis with drivers or operators for the purpose of
furnishing services are covered by the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.131(d).)</p><p>(4) 
Contracts for data collection,
surveys, computer services and the like are covered contracts, even though the
contractor may be required to furnish tangible items such as written reports or

to the services procured under the contract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.131(e).)</p><p>(5)

              <p>If a contractor desires to
segregate covered work from non-covered work under the SCA for purposes of
applying the SCA WD, the contractor must identify such covered work accurately
in the records or by other means. In this regard, an arbitrary assignment of
time on the basis of a formula, as between covered and non-covered work, is not
sufficient. However, if the contractor does not wish to keep detailed
hour-by-hour records for segregation purposes under the SCA, records can be
segregated on the wider basis of departments, work shifts, days, or weeks in
which covered work was performed. For example, if on a given day no Government
work was performed by a laundry under its contract, this day can be segregated
and shown in the records. Similarly, if on a given day only noontime meals were
provided by a restaurant under a covered contract to furnish meals to military
personnel, employment on the night shift could be segregated. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.169, 4.179.)</p>

              <h3>14g01 - Segregation: employees performing work in more than one
classification.</h3>
              <p>(a)   If an employee performs work which can be clearly
identified and segregated under more than one job classification listed in the
applicable WD, i.e., working in different capacities in the performance of the
contract, then the time spent by the employee in work properly related to each classification
should be segregated and paid according to the wage rate specified for each
classification. If the contractor cannot provide affirmative proof (employer
records) of the hours spent in each class of work, then the contractor must pay
the employee the highest of such rates for all hours worked in the workweek.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.169.)</p><p>(b)  Working in “different capacities” applies only to work
in different job classifications (e.g., janitors and window cleaners as defined
in the SCA Directory of Occupations), not to levels within the same job
classification (e.g., security guards I and II as defined in the SCA Directory
of Occupations). Thus, for example, segregating work performed by an employee
as security guard I and II would not be permitted. In such a situation, the
employee must be paid the highest rate listed in the WD for security guards
(i.e., security guard II rate) for all hours worked in the workweek on the
covered contract.</p>

              <h3>14g02 - Security guard services - compensability of training time.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Where a covered contract dictates that persons are
required to complete certain training before performing on the contract as
security guards, such persons are considered employees of the contractor while
undergoing such training and time spent in training is compensable hours worked
as described below. Whether this training is of limited application or more
general in nature (e.g., State-mandated training courses), it cannot be
considered “voluntary” within the meaning of the FLSA 29 C.F.R. 785.27, since
the contractor is obligated to provide employees in order to meet the
stipulations in the contract which require the training. Likewise, time spent
in training that is specifically required by a covered contract is compensable
hours worked even if the training is performed prior to formal contract award
or the trainee subsequently is not hired as a contract security guard. The
training time for such employees would be compensable work time, but not at the
compensation level provided in the applicable WD as the contract services for
which wage rates and fringe benefits are specified in the applicable WD are not
being performed. The contractor must pay wages for this training time at rates
not less than the MW specified under Section 6(a)(1) of the FLSA and Section
2(b)(1) of the SCA, unless otherwise specified in the applicable WD. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.146) </p><p>(b)  Time spent in on-the-job training (i.e., after start
of contract performance at the job site) must be paid for at not less than the
SCA MW/FB specified for the guard classification listed in the WD included in

              <h3>14g03 - Mail haul contracts hours worked issues.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The basic principles for determining hours worked by a
truck driver on duty for 24 hours or more as set forth in FOH 31b09 and 31b12
are applicable to SCA mail haul truck drivers. </p><p>(b)  Time during which an employee is considered on or off
duty by the Department of Transportation is not governed by the same principles
as apply under the FLSA. The DOT’s regulations are concerned primarily with the
safe operation of the vehicle and not compensable hours worked. Thus, the off-duty
time required by DOT for safety purposes may exceed the amount of sleep time or
other non-working time that may be deducted pursuant to FOH 31b09 or 31b12.</p><p>(c)   The principles set forth in FLSA 29 C.F.R. 785.14
through 785.22 must be applied to determine whether layover or breakdown time
is hours worked. Where such time is compensable hours worked and occurs on an
SCA contract, it must be paid at a rate not less than the applicable SCA WD
rate for drivers since such time is intrinsically related to contract work. If
a contractor chooses to pay for layover and breakdown time, which would
otherwise not be considered hours worked under FLSA 29 C.F.R. 785, for the
purpose of not breaking a driver’s continuous tour of duty on tours of 24 hours
or more, then such time must also be paid at the applicable SCA WD rate.</p><p>(d)  WH considers the totality of the circumstances in
determining whether layover or breakdown time is hours worked. Small remote
towns with few amenities often do not provide an opportunity for an employee to
use the time effectively for his own purposes. In such cases, the layover or
breakdown time would be considered hours worked and compensation must be no
less than the SCA WD rate.</p><p>(e)   Overtime exemption applicable to mail haul contracts.</p><p>Section 13(b)(1) of the FLSA
provides an overtime exemption for employees who are within the authority of
the Secretary of Transportation to establish qualifications and maximum hours
of service pursuant to Section 204 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935. On June
14, 1972, the Department of Transportation published a notice in the Federal
Register (37 Fed. Reg. 11781) asserting its power to establish qualifications
and maximum hours of service for contract mail haulers who operate in
interstate or foreign commerce.</p><p>The FLSA’s § 13(b)(1)
exemption may therefore apply to certain employees of contract mail haulers,
provided the tests for that exemption are met. See 29 C.F.R. § 782.8(b). Note,
however, that drivers, driver’s helpers, loaders, and mechanics, whose duties
affect the safety of operation of a vehicle engaged in transportation on public
highways in interstate or foreign commerce and who would otherwise satisfy the
exemption, are nonetheless required to be paid overtime compensation if the
vehicle used for mail haul purposes weighs 10,000 pounds or less. This is known
as the “small vehicle exception” to the motor carrier exemption. The small
vehicle exception applies and overtime pay is due to an employee in any
workweek when the employee’s work, “in whole or in part,” affects the safety of
operation of a small vehicle. The phrase “in whole or in part” means an
employee who performs such duties involving small vehicles for the entire week
or part of the week must receive overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in that
workweek.</p><p>Note that the small vehicle exception
will not apply to certain vehicles A) designed or used to transport more than 8
passengers (including driver) for compensation, B) designed or used to
transport more than 15 passengers (including driver) and not used to transport
passengers for compensation, or C) used in transporting hazardous material
requiring placarding under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of
Transportation. See Fact Sheet #19 and FAB 2010-2.</p><p>(f)   In addition, the CWHSSA exempts all Federal contracts
&quot;for transportation by land, air or water&quot; from its provisions for
overtime pay. The overtime provisions of this statute would also not apply to
employees working on USPS mail hauling contracts. (See 40 U.S.C. 3701(b)(3);
FOH 15i00(2) &amp; 15i01(c).)</p><p>(g)   Applicable wage rate.</p><p>The wage rate applicable to
mail haul truck drivers is based upon the point of origin of the route required
by the contract. This point of origin is commonly referred to as the “head out”
point. The “head out” rate is applicable to all drivers who work on the
contract regardless of where they may start their portion of the route. </p>

              <h3>14g04 - Cost of furnishing and maintaining uniforms.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Employees performing on most SCA food service,
security guard service, nursing home service, and janitorial service contracts
are required by the employer, by the employer’s Government contract, by law, or
by the nature of the work, to wear clean uniforms and/or related apparel or
equipment. In such situations, the financial cost of furnishing and maintaining
(except in the case of wash and wear uniforms, see (d) below) clean uniforms or
equipment is considered to be a business expense of the employer and may not be
imposed upon the employees if to do so would reduce their wages below the FLSA
MW or SCA prevailing wage rate (or FLSA or CWHSSA OT). Where the MW (or OT) is
diminished below the required rate, the employer must bear the cost of
providing clean uniforms and equipment up to the amount of any such deficiency.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.168(b).)</p><p>(b)  A determination of the cost of furnishing the uniforms
(and related equipment) itself presents no problem. If the employee is required
to furnish the uniform, the actual cost incurred by the employee shall be used
to ascertain whether a MW or OT violation has occurred. The same is true where
a commercial laundry or uniform rental services is utilized. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.168(b); FOH 30c12.)</p><p>(c)   Where uniform cleaning and maintenance is the
responsibility of the employee, a contractor may satisfy its wage obligation
under the Act by reimbursing employees $3.35/wk or $.67/day for such cleaning
and maintenance. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.168(b)(1)(ii).)</p><p>(d)  There generally is no requirement that employees be
reimbursed where the uniforms furnished are made of “wash and wear” materials
which may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments and
require no special treatment such as daily washing, dry cleaning or commercial
laundering. This limitation does not apply, however, where a different
provision has been set forth in the applicable WD. In the case of WDs issued
under Section 4(c) of the Act for successor contracts, the amount established
by the parties to the predecessor CBA is deemed to be the cost of laundering
uniforms. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.168(b)(2).)</p>

              <h3>14h00 - SCA Wage Determinations (WDs).</h3>
              <p>(a)   The SCA WD sets forth the MWs and FBs that contractors
and their subcontractors must pay service employees working on covered
contracts. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.3(a).)</p><p>(1) 
Wages are defined as monetary
compensation provided to employees. They are usually listed in the WD as hourly
rates.</p><p>(2) 
The FBs specified in the WD depend
upon the type of WD issued and the evaluation of source data used to develop
the WD. </p><p>(b)  Most WDs are revised periodically, as new wage and
benefit survey data become available. If a WD is properly included in the
contract at the time of award, the contract does not need to be modified to
include subsequent revisions to the WD prior to completion of the first year of
the contract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.5(a)(2).)</p><p>(c)   Section 10 of the Act requires a WD to be made by WH
for every covered service contract in excess of $2,500 and employing six or
more service employees. If five or fewer service employees are employed under a
contract, the contracting agency should obtain a WD, and if one is available,
incorporate it into the contract. WH is not required by the Act to issue a WD
for covered contracts that exceed $2,500 with five or fewer service employees,
but the contracting agency should still seek to obtain one. In instances where
no WD has been issued for a service contract involving five or fewer service
employees, the contractor can pay no less than the MW required by Section
6(a)(1) of the FLSA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.2, 4.3(a), 4.4(b)(1).)</p><p>(d)  Two Bases on which SCA WDs are issued:</p><p>(1) 
Prevailing in the locality WDs set
forth MWs and FBs determined to be prevailing for various classes of service
employees in the locality of the service contract after giving “due
consideration” to the rates applicable to such service employees if directly
hired by the Government. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.51.)</p><p>                                             
a.     Rates are usually based on data collected by the BLS
under the National Compensation and Occupational Employment Statistics Surveys;
or</p><p>                                            
b.     Rates may be based on union dominance where a single
rate is paid to a majority (50 percent or more) of workers in a class of
service employees engaged in similar work in a particular locality. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.51(b).)</p><p>(2) 
Section 4(c), or “successorship”,
WDs set forth the wages and benefits, including accrued and prospective
increases, contained in CBAs reached as a result of arm’s-length negotiations
that were applicable to service employees employed on predecessor contracts in
the same locality. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163.)</p><p>                                             
a.     For Section 4(c) to be applicable, the predecessor
contract must involve substantially the same services being provided in the
same locality. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(i).)</p><p>                                            
b.     The successor contractor is obligated to pay its
service employees the CBA rates whether or not the employees of the predecessor
contractor are hired by the successor contractor. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(a).)</p><p>                                             
c.     The provisions of Section 4(c) are self-executing and
failure to include the CBA rates in the WD issued for the successor contract
does not relieve a successor contractor of the statutory requirements to comply
with the CBA rates. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(b).)</p><p>                                            
d.     Any interpretation of the wage and FB provisions of
the CBA where its provisions are unclear must be based on the intent of the
parties to the CBA provided that such interpretation is not violative of law.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(j).)</p><p>                                             
e.     The obligation of the successor contractor is limited
to the wage and benefit requirements of the predecessor contractor’s CBA and
does not extend to other items such as seniority, grievance procedures, work
rules, overtime, etc. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(a).)</p><p>                                             
f.     The successor contractor may satisfy the FB provisions
of the CBA by furnishing any equivalent combination of benefits or by making
equivalent or differential payments in cash in accordance with 29 C.F.R. 4.177.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(j).)</p><p>                                             
g.     Application of Section 4(c) is not negated because the
contracting authority may change and the successor contract is awarded by a
different contracting agency. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(g).)</p><p>                                            
h.     The successorship provisions of Section 4(c) apply to
full term successor contracts. “Bridge” or short-term interim contracts due to
bid protest, default by the predecessor contractor, temporary closing of
facility, etc., are not predecessor contracts for Section 4(c) purposes and do
not negate the application of Section 4(c)’s successorship provisions to the
full term contract awarded after the temporary interruption or hiatus.
Contractors are required to pay the predecessor contractor’s CBA rates during
short-term interim contracts. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(h).)</p><p>                                              
i.     Under Section 4(c), the predecessor contractor’s
existing CBA provides the basis for the WD applicable to the successor
contract. If the CBA is no longer binding on the parties, e.g., as a result of
union decertification or a legitimate impasse recognized by the National Labor
Relations Act, the successorship requirements of Section 4(c) would be broken.
The CBA rates would not apply to the successor contract, but would continue to
apply throughout the contract period during which the decertification or
impasse was reached. </p><p>                                              
j.     Pursuant to Section 4(b) of the SCA, a variation limits
the self-executing application of Section 4(c) for new and changed CBAs entered
into by the incumbent contractor such that a new or changed CBA is not
effective for successorship purposes if: (1) in the case of a successor
contract for which bids have been invited by formal advertising, notice of the
terms of the new or changed CBA is received by the contracting agency less than
10 days before the date set for bid opening (provided that the contracting
agency finds that there is not reasonable time still available to notify
bidders), or (2) for awards of successor contracts to be entered into pursuant
to negotiations or resulting from execution of a renewal option or extension,
notice of the terms of the new or changed CBA is received by the contracting
agency after the award of the successor contract, and the start of contract performance
is within 30 days of the award, renewal option, or extension (however, if the
contract does not specify a start of performance date within 30 days from the
award, and/or performance of such procurement does not begin within this 30-day
period, any notice of the terms of the new or changed CBA received by the
contracting agency not less than 10 days before commencement of the contract
will be effective for purposes of the successor contract under Section 4(c)). This
variation will apply only if the contracting agency has given both the
incumbent contractor and its employees’ collective bargaining representative
written notification at least 30 days in advance of applicable estimated
procurement dates. Estimated procurement dates include bid solicitation, bid
opening, date of award, commencement of negotiations, receipt of proposals, or
the commencement date of a contract resulting from a negotiation, option, or
extension, as the case may be. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.1b(b).)</p><p>                                            
k.     There are two types of appeals that can be made
concerning collectively bargained rates where Section 4(c) applies -- based on
substantial variance issues, or based on issues concerning arm’s-length
negotiations. Both types of appeals are resolved based on administrative proceedings
handled by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Part 6, and/or
the Administrative Review Board (ARB) pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Part 8. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.10, 4.11, 4.163(c).) </p>

rates for classes of service employees to be employed on a covered service
contract that are not listed on the WD included in the contract (i.e., the work
to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the WD). (See
29 C.F.R. § 4.6(b)(2).)</p><p>(1) 
Contractors should conform wage
rates for any unlisted class of service employee before such an employee
performs any contract work and classify unlisted classes in a manner that
provides a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill
comparison) between the unlisted class and the classes listed in the WD.</p><p>(2) 
Conformed wage rates must be paid
to all employees in the affected class retroactive to the date such employees
commenced any contract work. Such rates are treated as if the rates and classes
had been included on the original WD issued for the contract. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.6(b)(2)(v).)</p><p>(3) 
Conformances may not be used to
artificially subdivide classes already listed in the WD. For example, a stock
clerk as defined in the “SCA Directory of Occupations” is the same job in terms
of knowledge, skills, and duties as the shelf stocker and store worker II. If a
stock clerk was listed in the WD, a conformance cannot be based on splitting
the job into two jobs and establishing a hybrid classification, e.g., shelf
stocker and stock clerk II. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1).)</p><p>(4) 
Where WDs list a series of levels
within a job classification family, e.g., Engineering Technicians I through VI,
the lowest level listed for a job classification family is considered to be the
entry level and establishment of a lower level through conformance is not
permissible. A conformance cannot establish a job level below the entry level
listed in the WD. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1).)</p><p>(5) 
Trainee classifications cannot be
conformed. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1).)</p><p>(6) 
Helper classifications in skilled
maintenance trades (e.g., electricians, machinists, automobile mechanics, etc.)
cannot be conformed. Helper classifications in skilled maintenance trades whose
duties constitute separate and distinct jobs may be used if listed in the WD.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1).)</p><p>(b)  Conformance Procedures.</p><p>(1) 
The contractor is required to
provide a written report of a proposed conformance, including information as to
whether the employees involved or their authorized representative agree or
disagree with the conformed wage rates and FBs, to the contracting officer no
later than 30 days after such unlisted class begins to perform work on the
contract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(ii).)</p><p>(2) 
The contracting officer, after
reviewing the proposed conformance, is required to submit a report that
includes the agency’s recommendation to the NO/Division of Wage Determinations/Branch
of Service Contract Wage Determinations for review. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.6(b)(2)(ii).)</p><p>(3) 
The Branch will approve, modify or
disapprove the proposed conformance or render a final determination within 30
days of receipt of the report or will notify the contracting agency that
additional time is necessary to review the report. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.6(b)(2)(ii).)</p><p>(4) 
The Branch will transmit the final
determination to the contracting officer who is to promptly notify the
contractor of the action taken. The contractor is required to furnish each
affected employee with a copy of the conformance determination or post it at
the job site as part of the WD. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(iii).)</p><p>(5) 
If the contracting agency does not
agree to submit a conformance, the WHD may initiate action pursuant to 29
C.F.R. § 4.6(b)(2)(vi) for a final determination of a proper conformed
classification, wage rate and/or FBs.</p><p>(6) 
In the case of a contract
modification, an exercise of an option or extension of an existing contract,
the conformance procedures provide an “indexing procedure” for previously
conformed classifications. A contractor can increase a previously conformed
rate by the average percentage increase between the rates listed in the current
WD for all classifications to be used on the contract and those rates specified
for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable WD without
obtaining WH approval or agreement by the employees involved, but must notify
the contracting officer. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(iv)(B).)</p>

              <p>(a)   The FBs that an employer is required to furnish
employees performing on a covered contract will be specified in the applicable
WD included in the contract documents.</p><p>(1) 
Any administrative costs (e.g.,
recordkeeping costs associated with payroll administration) incurred by a
contractor directly in providing FB plans are considered business expenses of
the firm and not contributions made on behalf of the employees. Such
administrative costs cannot be credited toward meeting the FB obligations of the
applicable WD. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.172.) </p><p>(2) 
The cost incurred by a Government
contractor’s insurance carrier (or third party trust fund) in its
administration and delivery of benefits to service employees can be credited
toward the contractor’s FB obligations under an SCA WD.</p><p>(b)  FB obligations may be discharged by furnishing any
equivalent combination of cash or bona fide FBs. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.170, 4.177.)</p><p>(c)   The terms “equivalent fringe benefit” and “cash
equivalent” mean equal in terms of monetary cost to the contractor. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.177(a)(3).)</p><p>(d)  It is the contractor’s responsibility to satisfy the
FB obligations set forth in an SCA WD. The contractor may choose the FBs to be
provided, whether an employee accepts or refuses the FBs offered. If an
employee desires cash payments or benefits other than those chosen by the
contractor, that would be a matter for discussion and resolution between the
employee and the employer. If the contractor furnished a lesser amount of the
FBs called for by the applicable WD, the contractor must furnish the employee
with the difference between the amount stated in the WD and the actual cost of
the FB which the contractor provided. As set forth in 29 C.F.R. 4.175(a)(2),
the contractor may make up the difference in cash to the employee, or furnish
equivalent benefits, or a combination thereof. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.177.)</p><p>(e)   If participation in the FB plan requires a
contribution from the employee’s wages, whether through payroll deduction or
otherwise, the employee’s concurrence is necessary. No contribution toward FBs
made by employees, or deducted from their wages, may be included or used by an
employer in satisfying any part of any FB obligation under the Act. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.168(a).)</p><p>(f)   Service employees employed by a single employer are
entitled to FB payments only up to a maximum of 40 hours per week, regardless
of the number of contracts on which they work, unless otherwise specified by
the applicable WD. This position only affects covered contracts subject to
“prevailing” WDs with the “fixed cost” per employee H&amp;W, paid vacation and
holiday benefits. Service employees who work for a single employer on multiple
contracts which may have other requirements, such as a collectively bargained
FB or an “average cost” H&amp;W FB, may be entitled to FB payments in excess of
40 hours per week. (See Dantran, Inc. v. U.S. DOL, 171 F.3d 58 (1st Cir.
1999).)</p><p>(g)   The FB requirements under successor contracts subject
to SCA Section 4(c) are included in 29 C.F.R. 4.163. Terms of the CBA will
dictate eligibility requirements, and the amount and extent of such FBs. Since
a successor contractor’s obligations are governed by the terms of the CBA, any
interpretation of the wage and FB provisions of the CBA where they are unclear
must be based on the intent of the parties, provided that such interpretation
does not violate the law. Some of the principles discussed in the regulations
regarding specific interpretations of the FB provisions of prevailing WDs may
not be applicable to WDs issued pursuant to Section 4(c). The provisions of Section
4(c), however, do not supersede the provision of Section 2(a)(2) of the Act
that allows a contractor to satisfy its FB obligations by furnishing any
equivalent combinations of FBs or by making equivalent or differential payments
in cash. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(j), 4.177.) </p>

              <h3>14j01 - “Bona fide” FB plans.</h3>
              <p>(a)   To be considered “bona fide” for SCA purposes, a FB
plan, fund, or program must constitute a legally enforceable obligation which
meets certain criteria. The plan, fund, or program must be compliant with the
Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), laws and regulations
enforced by the IRS, and State insurance laws, and contributions must be made
irrevocably to a trustee or third person pursuant to an insurance agreement,
trust, or other funded arrangement. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.171(a).)</p><p>(b)  The primary purpose of a FB plan under the SCA must be
to provide systematically for the payment of benefits to employees on account
of death, disability, advanced age, retirement, illness, medical expenses,
hospitalization, supplemental employment benefits, and the like. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.171(a)(2).) While not specifically enumerated in the regulations,
supplemental unemployment plans and prepaid legal plans are considered “bona
fide” FBs for purposes of the Act.</p><p>(c)   Unfunded, self-insured FB plans under which a
contractor allegedly makes “out of pocket” payments to provide benefits for
employees as costs are incurred, rather than making irrevocable contributions
to a trust or other funded arrangements, are not normally considered “bona
fide” plans or equivalent benefits except for plans to provide paid vacation
and holiday FBs. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.171(b)(1).)</p><p>(1) 
Under certain conditions, a
contractor may request approval by the Administrator of an unfunded
self-insured plan in order to allow credit for payments under such a plan in
meeting the FB requirements of the Act. The purpose of seeking advance approval
is to avoid situations involving unfunded plans where monies allegedly
allocated by a contractor to provide FBs are used for other purposes or are
recouped without actually furnishing any benefits. This procedure is not
intended to prohibit self-insured plans where irrevocable payments are made
pursuant to a trust or other funded arrangement and other conditions are met.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.171(b)(2).)<a name="OLE_LINK1"></a></p><p>(2) 
“Stop loss” insurance payments
that provide coverage in the event that claims paid from an unfunded
self-insured plan exceed specified limits both in the individual and the
aggregate can be credited against the FB obligations of the applicable WD.</p><p>(d)  Contractors may not take credit for any benefit
required by Federal, State, or local law such as workers’ compensation,
unemployment compensation, and Social Security contributions. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.171(c).)</p><p>(e)   The furnishing of facilities which are primarily for
the benefit or convenience of the contractor or the cost of which is properly a
business expense of the contractor is not the furnishing of a “bona fide” FB or
equivalent benefit or the payment of wages; e.g., items such as relocation expenses,
travel and transportation expenses incident to employment, incentive or
suggestion awards, etc. Also, a contractor cannot take credit toward its MW and
FB obligations for the cost of providing social functions or parties for
employees, flowers, cards, or gifts on employee birthdays, anniversaries, etc.
(sunshine funds), employee rest or recreation rooms, paid coffee breaks,
magazine subscriptions, and professional or club dues. (See 29 C.F.R.

              <h3>14j03 - Vacation pay.</h3>
              <p>(a)   General.</p><p>Eligibility for vacation
benefits specified in a prevailing WD is based on completion of a standard
period of past service. The principles to be followed in determining an
employee’s length of service for vacation eligibility are summarized below.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.173.)</p><p>(b)  Determining length of service.</p><p>Most prevailing WDs require
an employer to furnish employees a specified amount of paid vacation upon
completion of a specific length of service with a contractor or successor;
e.g., “one week paid vacation after one year of service with a contractor or
successor” or “one week’s paid vacation after one year of service.” Unless
specified otherwise in an applicable WD, the following two factors must be
taken into consideration in determining when an employee has completed the
required length of service to be eligible for vacation benefits:</p><p>(1) 
The total length of time spent by
an employee in the continuous service of the present (successor) contractor,
including both the time spent performing commercial work and the time spent
performing on the Government contract(s) itself. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.173(a)(1)(i).)</p><p>(2) 
Where applicable, the total length
of time spent in any capacity as an employee in the continuous service of any
predecessor contractor(s) who carried out similar contract functions at the
same Federal facility. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(a)(1)(ii).)</p><p>However, prior service as a
Federal employee is not counted toward an employee’s eligibility for vacation
benefits under the applicable WD. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(a)(3).) </p><p>(c)   Eligibility requirement - continuous service.</p><p>Under the principles set
forth above, if an employee’s total length of service adds up to at least one
year, the employee is eligible for the specified amount of vacation with pay
provided in the WD. The term “continuous service” does not require the
combination of two entirely separate periods of employment where there has been
a break in service. Whether or not there is a break in the continuity of
service so as to make an employee ineligible for a vacation benefit is
dependent upon all the facts in the particular case. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(b).)</p><p>(d)  Accrual or vesting and payment of vacation benefits.</p><p>Where a prevailing WD
specifies “one week paid vacation after one year of service with a contractor
or successor,” an employee who renders the “one year of service” continuously
becomes eligible for the “one week paid vacation” (i.e., 40 hours of paid
vacation, unless otherwise specified in an applicable WD) upon his/her
anniversary date of employment and upon each succeeding anniversary date
thereafter. There is no accrual or vesting of vacation eligibility before the
employee’s anniversary date of employment, and no segment of time smaller than
one year need be considered in computing the employer’s vacation liability,
unless otherwise specifically provided for in a particular WD. The vacation
benefits need not be provided by the employer on the date of vesting. However,
the required benefit must be furnished before the employee’s next anniversary
date, before the current contract is completed, or before the employee
terminates employment, whichever occurs first. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(c)(2).)</p><p>(e)   Contractor liability for vacation benefits.</p><p>The liability for an
employee’s vacation is not prorated among contractors unless specifically
provided for in a particular WD. The contractor by whom a person is employed at
the time the vacation right vests, i.e., on the employee’s anniversary date of
employment, must provide the full benefit required by the applicable WD on that
date before the employee’s next anniversary date, before the current contract
is completed, or before the employee terminates employment, whichever occurs
first. Thus, vacation benefits must be complied with in full on an annual
basis. Any unused vacation benefits may not be “carried over” from year to
year. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(c)-(d).)</p><p>(f)   Certified listing of employee anniversary dates.</p><p>In the case of a contract
performed at a Federal facility where employees may be retained by a succeeding
contractor, 29 C.F.R. 4.6(1)(2) provides that the incumbent prime contractor
must furnish a certified list of all service employees on the contractor’s or
subcontractor’s payroll during the last month of the contract, together with
the anniversary dates of employment (with the incumbent as well as predecessor contractors)
of each such employee, to the contracting officer not less than 10 days before
contract completion. A copy of this list is to be provided to the successor
contractor for determining employee eligibility for vacation FBs which are
based on length of service with predecessor contractors (where such benefit is
required by an applicable WD). Failure to obtain such employment data does not
relieve a contractor from any obligation to provide vacation benefits. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.173(d)(2).)</p><p>(g)   Rate applicable to computation of vacation benefits.</p><p>The rate applicable to the
computation of vacation benefits is the applicable WD rate or employee’s
regular rate of pay, whichever is higher, at the time the vacation benefit is
provided or a cash equivalent is paid. If an applicable WD requires that the
hourly wage rate be increased during the period of the contract, the rate
applicable to the computation of any required vacation benefits is the hourly
rate in effect in the w/w in which the actual paid vacation is provided or the
equivalent is paid, as the case may be, and would not be the average of two
hourly rates. This rule would not apply to situations where a WD specified a
different method of computation and the rate to be used. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.173(e)(1).)</p><p>(h)  Cash equivalent for vacation.</p><p>Where an employer elects to
pay an hourly cash equivalent in lieu of a paid vacation, which is computed in
accordance with 29 C.F.R. 4.177(c)(5), such payments need commence only after
the employee has satisfied the “after one year of service” requirement (in
cases where there is such an eligibility requirement). However, should the
employee terminate employment for any reason before receiving the full amount
of vested vacation benefits due, the employee must be paid the full amount of
any difference remaining as a final cash payment. The rate applicable to the
computation of cash equivalents for vacation benefits is the hourly wage rate
in effect at the time such equivalent payments are actually made. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.173(c)(1) and (e)(1).)</p>

              <h3>14j04 - Holiday pay.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Most prevailing WDs list a specific number of named
holidays for which payment is required. A full-time employee who is eligible to
receive payment for a named holiday must receive a full day’s pay up to 8 hours
unless a different standard is used in the WD, such as one reflecting CBA
benefit requirements. A full-time employee who works on the day designated as a
holiday must be paid, in addition to the amount he/she ordinarily would be
entitled to for that day’s work, the cash equivalent of a full-day’s pay up to
8 hours, or be furnished another day off with pay. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.174(c)(1)-(2).)</p><p>(b)  An employee’s entitlement to holiday pay fully vests
by working in the w/w in which the named holiday occurs. Accordingly, any
employee who is terminated before receiving the full amount of holiday benefits
due must be paid the holiday benefits as a final cash payment. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.174(c)(4).) </p><p>(c)   If the applicable WD does not include a paid holiday
provision for any day declared by the U.S. President to be a holiday, or for
any work day where the Federal facility is closed such as due to inclement
weather, the contractor is not required to pay covered service employees who
take that day off. Any pay provided would be a matter of discretion for the
contractor, and contract payments for such time not worked would be a
procurement matter within the purview of the contracting agency.</p>

part-time, and full-time employees. In the absence of express limitations, the
FBs specified in the WD apply to all temporary and part-time service employees
engaged in covered work. However, in general, temporary and part-time employees
are only entitled to an amount of the FBs specified in the WD which is
proportionate (i.e., a pro rata share) to the amount of time spent in covered
work. Unless otherwise specified in the WD, vacation and holiday benefits are
based upon a full-time schedule that consists of 40 hours a week or eight hours
a day. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.165(a)(2), 4.176(a); FOH 14i00(c).)</p><p>(b)  Holiday obligations to temporary and part-time
employees who work an irregular schedule of hours may be discharged by paying
such employees a proportion of the holiday benefits due full-time employees

obligations, the number of hours such employee worked in the year preceding the

              <h3>14j06 - Health and welfare (H&W) and pension payments.</h3>
              <p>(a)   As set forth in AAM No. 188, a single “prevailing”
nationwide H&amp;W rate method has been established for determining FB
requirements to be incorporated in most SCA WDs. The single rate is generally
updated once a year based upon data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
Employment Cost Index (ECI) summary of Employer Cost for Employee Compensation.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.52(a), 4.175.)</p><p>(b)  “Fixed cost” per employee H&amp;W FBs (29 C.F.R.
4.175(a)).            </p><p>(1) 
Most prevailing WDs containing
H&amp;W and/or pension requirements specify a fixed payment per hour on behalf
of each service employee. This FB is due each service employee on the basis of
“all hours paid for,” including paid vacations, holidays, and sick leave, up to
a maximum of 40 hours per week and 2,080 hours per year. Payments are specified
on the WD in hourly, weekly, and monthly amounts.</p><p>(2) 
If a WD specifies a FB that can be
obtained for less than the amount of contribution required on the WD, the
employer must make up the difference in cash to the employee, or furnish
equivalent benefits, or a combination thereof. The FBs and cash equivalent
payments under the “fixed cost” per employee benefit requirement may be made in
varying amounts to employees, provided the total amount paid by the contractor
for FBs and/or cash equivalents to each individual employee is at least the
amount required by the WD.</p><p>(c)   “Average cost” H&amp;W FBs (29 C.F.R. 4.175(b).)</p><p>(1) 
Some WDs specifically provide for
H&amp;W and/or pension benefits in terms of average cost. In such cases, a
contractor’s contributions per employee to a “bona fide” plan are permitted to
vary, depending upon the individual employee’s marital or employment status. It
is also possible under the “average cost” concept for some employees to not
receive any FBs.</p><p>(2) 
The contractor’s total contributions
for all service employees enrolled in the plan must average at least the WD
requirements per hour per service employee. In determining average cost, “all
hours worked,” including overtime hours, for all service employees that were
employed on the contract during the payment period must be counted. The term
“all hours worked” does not include paid leave hours, such as vacations,
holidays, or sick leave. It also does not cover any unpaid leave time.</p><p>(3) 
The contractor’s total
contributions for all service employees enrolled in the FB plan(s) must average
at least the FB obligation stated in the WD. The types and amounts of benefits
(if any) provided, and the eligibility requirements for service employees to
participate in a FB plan, are decided by the employer.</p><p>(4) 
If the contractor’s contributions
average less than the amount required during a payment period, the contractor
must make up the deficiency by providing cash equivalent payments or equivalent
FB payments to all service employees who worked on the contract during the
payment period. However, cash equivalent payments under the “average cost” FB
requirements can only be made in an amount determined to be deficient after
payments have been made to the FB plans, and then must be made equally to all
service employees based upon their hours worked. A contractor cannot make cash
equivalent payments to some employees and not to others, nor can a contractor
pay different cash amounts to employees under the same contract. A contractor
must pay the same amount of cash equivalent payments per hour worked to all
employees. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(b).)</p><p>(d)  Some H&amp;W and pension plans contain eligibility
exclusions for certain employees. Also, employees receiving benefits through
participation in plans of an employer other than the contractor or by a
spouse’s employer may be prevented from receiving benefits from the
contractor’s plan because of prohibitions against “double coverage.” While such
exclusions do not invalidate an otherwise bona fide plan, the employees excluded
from participation in the plan must be furnished equivalent bona fide FBs or be
paid a cash equivalent payment during the period they are not eligible, or
choose not to participate in the plan. An employee who desires to opt-out of
the contractor’s health plan must demonstrate that his or her other coverage
specifically prohibits double coverage in writing. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(c).)</p><p>(e)   It is not required that all employees participating in
a FB plan be entitled to receive payments from the plan at all times. For
example, a contractor may be permitted to claim credit for contributions made
to FB plans on behalf of participating employees during periods of time when
they may not be entitled to receive benefits (e.g., a 30-day “waiting period”
under some insurance plans for newly hired employees). If no contributions are
made for such employees, then no credit may be taken toward the contractor’s FB
obligations. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(c)(2).)</p><p>(f)   Payments to a “bona fide” H&amp;W or pension insurance
plan or trust program may be made on a periodic basis, but not less often than
quarterly. If the plan requires that contributions be made on a monthly basis,
then to be in compliance the contractor must reconcile the cost incurred by
such contributions against its SCA FB obligations on a monthly (or no less
often than monthly) basis. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(d)(1).)</p><p>(g)   Where the WD specifies a fixed contribution on behalf
of each employee, and a contractor exercises the option to make hourly cash
equivalent or differential payments, such payments must be made promptly on the
regular payday for wages. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.165(a)(1), 4.175(d)(1),
4.177(c)(1).)</p><p>(h)  The only restriction the SCA places on pension plans,
including 401(k) plans, is that they be “bona fide” FB plans. Such plans are
considered “bona fide” if they meet the requirements of Section 7(e)(4) of the
FLSA. (See FLSA 29 C.F.R. 778.215; SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.170, 4.171(a).)</p><p>(1) 
Neither the SCA nor its
implementing regulations address vesting requirements with respect to retirement
plans. However, bona fide plans are required to meet the vesting requirements
pursuant to ERISA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.171(a)(5).)</p><p>(2) 
Pension plans that define a year’s
service for vesting purposes in terms of a minimum number of hours worked by a
participant and require certain number of years in service for a participant to
become fully vested would be in compliance with the SCA so long as the plan’s
vesting provisions meet ERISA’s requirements.</p><p>(3) 
Pension plans often provide that
forfeitures of employees who do not vest under the plan will be used to reduce
the employer’s contribution in the following year. For SCA purposes, an
employer may not use forfeitures as a credit towards satisfying the
requirements of an applicable WD. To allow an employer to do so would result in
the employer’s taking double credit for the same contribution. Forfeitures that
are allocated to the accounts of remaining eligible participants would,
however, be creditable toward meeting FB obligations under the SCA.</p>

              <h3>14k00 - General provisions.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The SCA does not provide for compensation of covered
employees at premium rates for overtime hours of work. Section 6 of the Act
recognizes that other Federal laws, such as the FLSA and CWHSSA may require
such compensation to be paid to employees working on or in connection with
SCA-covered contracts. CWHSSA (40 U.S.C. 327 - 332) is more limited in scope
than the FLSA (29 U.S.C. 201, et seq.) and generally applies to Federal Government
contracts in excess of $100,000 that require or involve the employment of
laborers, mechanics, guards, and “watchmen.” (See SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.180 - 4.182;
CWHSSA 29 C.F.R. 5.1 - 5.17; FLSA 29 C.F.R. 778; FOH 15g - k and 32.)</p><p>(b)  Overtime must be paid at one and one-half times the
basic hourly rate (or the regular rate of pay, whichever is higher). (See SCA
29 C.F.R. 4.180 - 4.182; CWHSSA 29 C.F.R. 5.5(b)(1); FLSA 29 C.F.R. Part 778;
FOH 15k00 - 15k09 and 32.)</p><p>(c)   The SCA excludes the amounts paid by a contractor or
subcontractor for FBs in the computation of overtime under the FLSA and CWHSSA
whenever the overtime provisions of either of those acts apply concurrently
with the SCA’s wage provisions. (See SCA 4.177(e), 4.180; FLSA 29 C.F.R.
778.7.)</p><p>(d)  Neither the FLSA, nor the CWHSSA, preclude any State,
territory, or municipality from implementing its own labor standards with
respect to minimum wage and overtime compensation. If Federal and State laws
have different requirements, a contractor would be obligated to satisfy both
sets of standards in order to ensure compliance. (See FLSA 29 C.F.R. 778.5.)</p><p>(e)   The CWHSSA requires that “liquidated damages shall be
computed, with respect to each individual employed as a laborer or mechanic in
violation of any provision of this Act, in the sum of $10 for each calendar day
on which such individual was required or permitted to work in excess of the
standard workweek of 40 hours without payment of the overtime required by this
Act.” In addition, in all cases, liquidated damages are also required to be
computed in situations where an employee is paid overtime at an incorrect basic
hourly rate of pay. (See CWHSSA 29 C.F.R. 5.8; FOH 15k10.)</p>

              <h3>14k01 - “Laborers” and “Mechanics” under CWHSSA.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Service employees may also be “laborers” and
“mechanics” for purposes of CWHSSA. The terms “laborers” and “mechanics”
include at least those employees whose duties are manual or physical in nature
as distinguished from mental or managerial. Generally, employees whose duties
are supervisory, professional, and clerical are not “laborers” or “mechanics”
for purposes of CWHSSA. Determinations as to whether individual employees are
“laborers” or “mechanics” are based on the duties actually performed under the
contract rather than occupational titles or job descriptions. A job that
requires manual and mechanical dexterity and is primarily reliant on the use of
hands would be typical of mechanical or manual occupations that would fall with
the scope of a “laborer” or “mechanic” under CWHSSA. The CWHSSA also applies to
guards and “watchmen” employed on Government contracts in excess of $100,000.
