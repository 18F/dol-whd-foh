              <h3>24L03  Application of exemption - type of establishment.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The statutory language of Sec 13(b)(10)
both prior to and subsequent to 5/1/74 limits the exemption to the specified
employees of nonmanufacturing establishments primarily engaged in the business of
selling automobiles, trailers, trucks, farm implements (boats effective 5/1/74)
or aircraft to ultimate purchasers. It does not apply to employees of
automobile parts and accessories wholesalers, retail auto parts stores,
automotive repair garages or other establishments not primarily engaged in
selling the named vehicles.</p><p>(b)   In the case of dealerships in the named
vehicles it will not be necessary, where departments functionally operated as
part of the dealership are at different locations, to determine whether they
are parts of the main establishment or physical places of business qualifying
as separate establishments under the customary tests. A specific legislative
intent to include all such parts of the dealership’s business as one
establishment for purposes of Sec 13(b)(10) is made plain by statements in the
legislative history that the exemption is intended to apply to the named
classes of employees employed by a dealership in the described vehicles “even
if they work in physically separate buildings or areas, or even if, though
working in the principal building of the dealership, their work relates to the
work of physically separate buildings or areas, so long as they are employed in
a department which is functionally operated as part of the dealership”. Thus,
for example, if a new car dealer operates a used car lot at a different
location, employees who work at that lot may qualify for the exemption if the
used car lot is operated as a part of the dealership. (See also IB 779.372(b)(1).)</p>

              <h3>24L04  “Salesman”, “partsman”, and “mechanic”.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Sec 13(b)(10) provides an OT exemption
for employees of the various described establishments (see FOH 24L03) who are
employed as a “salesman”, “partsman”, or “mechanic”, and who are “primarily
engaged” (see IB 779.372(d)) in selling or servicing the named vehicles, farm
implements or aircraft (see chart FOH 24L04). Assuming that the establishment
tests are met, it is thus necessary to determine whether the employee’s duties
are in fact those of a salesman, partsman, or mechanic (or some combination of
these duties where appropriate), and, if so, whether he is primarily engaged in
selling or servicing the named vehicles, farm implements or aircraft. The
exemption applies on a w/w basis. It is not pertinent that such salesmen,
partsmen, or mechanics are individually engaged in selling to or servicing the
named product primarily for the “ultimate purchaser”; it is only necessary for
the establishment to be primarily so engaged for the exemption to be applicable
(see FOH 24L08).</p><p>(b)   In determining whether an employee is in
fact a salesman, partsman, or mechanic, a primary duty test shall be applied.
Thus, for example, an employee to be classified as a “mechanic” must spend more
than 50% of his time in performing the duties of a mechanic, with respect to
the named vehicles, farm implements, or aircraft, including duties which are
incidental thereto. (For purposes of applying the primary duty test, all the
duties of an employee as a salesman, partsman, or mechanic may be combined.)</p><p>(c)   Partsman.</p><p>The term “partsman”, as used in Sec
13(b)(10), means an employee whose primary duty is to requisition, stock, and
dispense parts for the named vehicles, farm implements or aircraft to be used
by the establishment’s employees, or to sell or dispense such parts to the
establishment’s customers (see IB 779. 372(c)(3)). This includes incidental
clerical duties involved in such work, and keeping the stockroom, bins, and
shelves in order. (See also subpart (e) of this Sec.)</p><p>(d)   Mechanic.</p><p>(See IB 779.372(c)(3).) The term
“mechanic”, as used in Sec 13 (b)(10), generally describes an employee whose
primary duty is to perform mechanical work on a named vehicle, farm implement,
or aircraft to place it in proper operating condition by making any necessary
adjustments or repairs. This includes an employee doing mechanical work such as
“get ready” mechanics, automotive, truck, trailer, farm implement or aircraft
mechanics, body or fender mechanics, used car reconditioning mechanics, and
wrecker mechanics. Work of the following types is not in itself considered
mechanical work for purposes of the primary duty test in applying Sec 13(b)(10)
even though performed on a named vehicle, farm implement or aircraft:</p><p>(1) 
washing, cleaning or
polishing</p><p>(2) 
lubricating</p><p>(3) 
packing wheel
bearings</p><p>(4) 
changing oil and oil
filters</p><p>(5) 
changing tires</p><p>(6) 
painting</p><p>(7) 
carpentry</p><p>(8) 
dispatching</p><p>(9) 
installing or
repairing seat covers</p><p>(10) 
checking, servicing,
or repairing the plumbing, electrical, and butane gas systems, the doors,
windows and other structural features of mobile home trailers (as opposed to
the running mechanisms, such as wheels axles, brakes, hitches, and signal
lights).</p><p>However,
such work may be performed in some instances by an employee as an incident to
mechanical work and would be included as the work of a “mechanic” in applying
the primary duty test. For example, an automotive repairman may install ball
joints or tie rods on the “front end” of a truck or automobile and lubricate
the repaired parts when he has finished; he may replace a broken piston and in
the process change oil and install a new oil filter; or he may replace a wheel
bearing and at the same time repack it with the necessary lubricant.</p><p>(e)   Parts chaser.</p><p>A “parts chaser” whose primary duty is
that of a messenger to pick up needed parts, as directed, from the warehouse
and from other dealers is not exempt under Sec 13(b)(10) as a “partsman”. On
the other hand, if the primary duty of such an employee is to see to the
adequacy of the stock on hand and to procure necessary stock, to make billings,
and to clean parts for return to the factory under warranty replacement, he
would be considered a “partsman” for purposes of the exemption.</p><p>(f)   Mechanic - irrigation systems.</p><p>Farm implement dealers who sell or
service irrigation systems and component parts (see FOH 24L07) may have
employees engaged in repairing such items or in cutting, fitting, and tailoring
at the shop the items sold, to meet the needs of a particular farming
operation. Such activities are considered to be those performed by a “mechanic”
as the term is used in Sec 13(b)(10). Employees engaged in assembly of an
irrigation system or components in the field (after repairs have been made or
the cutting, fitting and tailoring at the shop has been done) are not
performing the work of a “mechanic” to whom the exemption is intended to apply.
The possibility of exemption under Sec 13(a)(6) or Sec 13(b)(12) should not be
overlooked.</p><p>(g)   Trimmers.</p><p>Some automobile dealers employ persons
called “trimmers”. The following are examples of duties performed by trimmers
which are considered mechanical work for purposes of the 50% test of section
13(b)(l0): repairing the cranking mechanism of car window; repairing interior
of doors and roofs of cars; repairing windshield wiper mechanisms; and repairing
chrome strips around door frames.</p><p>(h)  Diagnosticians and inspectors.</p><p>Employees variously described as
diagnosticians and inspectors may be considered as being akin to service
writers. (See IB 779.372(c).) Such employees may use machines and also do visual
inspections to note the condition of a vehicle, and indicate the parts and
services necessary for repairs. Diagnosing and inspecting in and of itself, as
would be the case for example when diagnostic and inspection work is done for
other mechanics would not be exempt. However, where an employee is a mechanic
and is working as a mechanic and part of his employment is diagnosing and
inspecting the vehicle before doing the actual repair, such diagnostic and
inspection work is part of his exempt work.</p><p>(i)    Job comparison - old Sec 13(b)(10) and

is not material. The crucial question is whether or not the sale is to the

parts to the general public, the sales at discount to truck lines for use in
repairing their vehicles, as well as the so-called insurance and warranty sales
of parts are all to the ultimate purchaser within the meaning of Sec 13(b)(10).

shops, garages and other establishments likely to resell the parts are sales
for resale and not sales to the ultimate purchaser within the meaning of Sec

primarily engaged (see IB 779. 372(d)) in selling the named vehicles to
ultimate purchasers.</p>

within the meaning of Sec 13(b)(10)(B) if it is designed to be a vehicle or
moving conveyance. Mobile homes of any type (including “double/triple wides”)
may be considered to be trailers if they are designed to be transported from
place to place as a trailer, that is, if they have their own wheels and
suspension system and can be towed behind a powered vehicle.</p><p>(b)   WH will consider a mobile home to be a
trailer if it is built on a permanent chassis or transportation system which
includes a drawbar and coupling mechanism, frame, running gear assembly, and
lights.</p><p>(c)   The following definitions apply to the
components of a trailer chassis:</p><p>(1) 
“Drawbar and coupling
mechanism” includes the rigid assembly upon which the coupling mechanism is
mounted and which connects the manufactured home’s frame to the towing vehicle.</p><p>(2) 
“Frame” refers to the
fabricated rigid substructure which provides support to the manufactured home
structure both during transport and on-site. It also provides a platform for
attachment of the rest of the transportation system.</p><p>(3) 
“Running gear
assembly” includes suspension springs, axles, bearings, wheels, hubs, tires,
and brakes.</p><p>(4) 
“Lights” means safety
lights and associated wiring.</p><p>(d)    </p><p>(1) 
In 1976, the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development established safety standards (known
as the HUD Code) for manufactured housing intended for sale as trailers or
mobile homes. A label certifying conformance with these standards is required
to be affixed to all such mobile homes built since 6/15/76.</p><p>(2) 
For enforcement
purposes, the presence of the HUD Code label will be sufficient proof that the
manufactured home is being sold as a trailer.</p><p>(e)    </p><p>(1) 
Notwithstanding (d)
above , it may be documented at the time of sale that parts of the
transportation system are to be removed and that the mobile home is to be
emplaced on a permanent foundation requiring extensive site preparation. A
mobile home sold under these conditions will not be considered a trailer within
the meaning of Sec 13(b)(10)(B).</p><p>(2) 
Typical installation
on concrete pads with sewer and water connections, electricity, anchoring
apparatus or cables, and “skirting” is not considered permanent emplacement.</p>

              <p>(a)   Generally, the Sec 13(b)(1) exemption is
limited to employees of motor carriers (see IB 782.2). However, the Motor
Carrier Act gives the DOT power to establish qualifications and maximum hours
of service for drivers employed by non-carriers in situations where the
non-carrier leases or rents motor vehicles with such drivers to motor carriers.
Thus, where all other tests for exemption are met, Sec 13(b)(1) is applicable
to these drivers while they are driving the motor vehicles leased or rented to
motor carriers, on the same basis as if they were actually employed by the
carriers.</p><p>(b)   Except as provided in (a) above, Sec
13(b)(1) does not extend to other safety-affecting employees of the leasing or
renting establishment, such as mechanics, unless the employer is a motor
carrier in his own right. For example, the employer may conduct his operations
in such a manner as to be a private carrier, or he may lease or rent motor
vehicles to a shipper under such conditions that he maintains control and
direction over the carrier services performed in which case he would be a
contract carrier.</p>

              <h3>24a05  DOT jurisdiction over private carriers limited to carriage of
property.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Sec 203(a)(17) of the Motor Carrier Act
defines the term “private carrier of property by motor vehicle” to mean “any
person not included in the terms ‘common carrier by motor vehicle’ or ‘contract
carrier by motor vehicle’ , who or which transports in interstate or foreign
commerce by motor vehicle property of which such person is the owner, lessee,
or bailee, when such transportation is for the purpose of sale, lease, rent, or
bailment, or in furtherance of any commercial enterprise”.</p><p>(b)   It should be noted that the DOT
jurisdiction over private carriers is limited to private carriers of
“property”. If the transportation of persons is the primary purpose of a trip
in interstate commerce by a private carrier and any incidental transportation
of property is not significant as a reason for the trip, the transportation
involved would not be within the jurisdiction of the DOT. An employee would not
be considered as engaged in transporting property for purposes of the Motor
Carrier Act because of an arrangement to drive by the post office on his way to
or from work to pick up or deliver his employer’s interstate mail or packages,
whether bulky or not.</p><p>(c)   If the transportation of property,
regardless of its bulk or weight, is the primary purpose of an interstate trip
by a private carrier, or if the transportation of such property is a distinct
and definite reason for the trip along with the transportation of persons, the
transportation is within the jurisdiction of the DOT. This principle would
apply, for example, where property such as an automobile or a truck is driven to
another State not simply as a means of transportation for the driver or
passengers but because the movement of the vehicle itself is a distinct purpose
of the trip. Likewise, this principle applies where self-propelled machines
such as bulldozers and cranes are driven over the public highways as part of a
journey in which such vehicles are moved from one State to another.</p><p>(d)   The fact that an employee of a private
carrier may use his own vehicle in transporting property in interstate commerce
does not deny an otherwise applicable exemption.</p>

              <p>(a)   In most cases the transportation of goods
from a point of origin within a State to a processing or manufacturing
establishment in the same State is not exempt under Sec 13(b)(1) because an
actual out-of-State movement of the goods does not begin until the processing
or manufacturing has taken place. (See IB 782.7(c).) In the usual situation
there are two separate and distinct movements of the goods under the Motor Carrier
Act, the one before processing being in “intrastate” commerce and the one after
proces­sing being in “interstate or foreign” commerce. There are certain
situations, however, where processing or packaging operations are performed on
goods during the course of their movement to a specified out-of-State
destination under such circumstances that the exemption may be applied to the
transportation preceding the operations as well as to that which follows. Such
transportation is viewed as a single movement for purposes of the Motor Carrier
Act and FLSA Sec 13(b)(1) where the practical continuity of the journey from
the point of origin within the State to the intended out-of-State destination
has not been broken. The following examples illustrate this principle:</p><p>(1) 
Coal being shipped to
an out-of-State buyer is hauled to a tipple where, in a continuous operation,
it is unloaded from the truck and cleaned, crushed, or graded and loaded
directly into railroad cars for shipment out-of-State; or</p><p>(2) 
Household goods are transported
by truck from a home to a warehouse to be crated or packed so that the movement
by motor vehicle to the intended out-of-State destination may be continued.</p>

of Transportation (DOT) has no jurisdiction over the operation of ambulances
and hearses within the meaning of the FLSA Sec 13(b)(1) motor carrier
exemption, and that the exemption does not apply to employees so engaged. This
position is derived from court and administrative decisions and a statement by
DOT disclaiming jurisdiction over ambulances. Spires v. Ben Hill County, 980
F.2d 683 (11th Cir. 1993); Jones v. Giles, 741 F.2d 245 (9th Cir. 1984); Lonnie

joined the Ninth Circuit (Jones) in holding that ambulance drivers are not
subject to FLSA Sec 13(b)(l). Both courts noted that the Interstate Commerce
Commission (ICC) (DOT predecessor) had determined that the unique operation of
ambulances compared to other forms of motor transportation put them outside the
ICC’s jurisdiction. The only decision specifically contrary is Benson v.
Universal Ambulance Service. Inc., 675 F.2d 783 (6th Cir. 1982), a decision
which did not deal with the ICC ruling, and both the Ninth and Eleventh
Circuits specifically declined to follow Benson. (See also FOH 52p07.)</p>

origin to the ultimate destina­tion. Thus, the Sec 13(b)(1) exemption is
applicable to the delivery drivers who transport and deliver the newspaper

              <h3>24d02  Transportation of commodities from terminal storage.</h3>
              <p>(a)   IB 782.7(b)(1) contains an enforcement
policy with respect to motor carrier transportation of property or passengers
within a single State which provides that any such movement which is in
interstate commerce under the FLSA will be considered a movement in interstate
commerce under the Motor Carrier Act (Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act)
except where the DOT or the courts hold otherwise. However, as stated in IB
782.7(b)(2), the DOT has held that transportation confined to points in a
single State from a storage terminal of commodities which have had a prior
movement by rail, pipeline, motor, or water from an origin in a different State
is not in interstate commerce within the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act if the
shipper has no fixed and persisting transportation intent beyond the terminal
storage point at the time of the shipment. It has been specifically found that
there is no fixed and persisting intent where the following three conditions
are present:</p><p>(1) 
At the time of
shipment there is no specific order being filled for a specific quantity of a
given product to be moved through to a specific destination;</p><p>(2) 
The terminal storage
is a distribution point or local marketing facility from which specific amounts
of the product are sold or allocated; and</p><p>(3) 
Transportation in the
furtherance of this distribution within the single State is specifically
arranged only after sale or allocation from storage.</p><p>The
term “fixed and persisting transportation intent” as used by the DOT refers to
the intent of the shipper of the commodities into the State, who may or may not
also be the importer. If in applying the tests set out in (1) through (3) above
it is determined that there was no such intent on the part of the shipper, the
interstate movement of the commod­ities under the Motor Carrier Act ends with
delivery to a terminal storage facility even where a “practical continuity of
movement” through the terminal (Jacksonville Paper rule) makes the subsequent
movement of all or part of the commodities from terminal storage to a
destination in the same State a part of their movement in interstate commerce
under the FLSA. Thus, in situations where the three tests are in fact met, as
has been found to be true with respect to movement of petroleum products
through pipeline and water terminals, such a subsequent movement would be
considered a separate intrastate movement under the Motor Carrier Act even
though the importer ordered the out-of-State goods in anticipation of the needs
of a stable group of specified customers, or to meet the needs of particular
customers pursuant to an understanding with them, or to fill previously
received orders of his customers. However, these facts which demonstrate a
“practical continuity of movement” under FLSA may, in par­ticular cases, also demonstrate
that one or more of the three DOT condi­tions are not met, and must be
carefully examined with this in mind in any situation in which the application
of the tests to the facts present in such situation has not specifically been
determined by the DOT.</p><p>(b)   In some situations the shipper is also
the importer, as would be the case where a manufacturer, such as a bakery,
produces goods in one State and moves them through his distribution point in
another State to his cus­tomers in that State. The employer, as the shipper,
knows at the time of the shipment what he intends to do with the goods after
they reach his out-of-State distribution point. If, as would normally be the
case, there is a “practical continuity of movement” of the out-of-State goods
through the firm’s distribution point to its customers, this is sufficient to
establish a “fixed and persisting transportation intent” beyond the
distribution point for purposes of applying Sec 13(b)(1).</p><p>(c)   Transportation within a single State of
petroleum products from pipeline or water terminals, as ordinarily performed,
has specifically been held by the DOT to be in intrastate rather than
interstate commerce within the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act. Employees
engaged in such transporta­tion, if covered on traditional or enterprise
grounds under FLSA, are not within the Sec 13(b)(l) exemption.</p><p>(d)   Transportation within a single State from
a chain store warehouse to outlets of the chain, of goods brought into the
State for sale at the outlets, is covered on traditional “in commerce” grounds
under the FLSA and is also transportation in interstate commerce under the
Motor Carrier Act. The Sec 13(b)(l) exemption applies to the drivers, drivers’
helpers, loaders and mechanics concerned with such transportation. This has
been established in the courts and the DOT determination in paragraph (a) above
has no application. The situation of the chain store warehouse differs in
essential respects from that of the terminals considered by the DOT in its
decision. As the courts have uniformly held, the situation in the chain store
cases is one where goods are shipped from one State and briefly ware­housed in
another for the convenience of the owner in making an efficient distribution of
those goods to its local retail outlets. All goods ordered from other States
for delivery to the warehouse are ordered to supply the needs of the retail
stores, and the shipper will know or can be presumed to know that these stores
are the ultimate destination of the goods shipped. Transportation of goods from
the warehouse to the retail outlets is typically scheduled for the most part on
a continuing basis, rather than only after specific items have been sold or
allocated from storage.</p><p>(e)   Transportation within a single State from
the warehouse of an independent wholesaler or supplier of goods ordered from
other States to meet the needs of an associated or allied group of retail
stores may be assumed to be in interstate commerce within the meaning of the
Motor Carrier Act for purposes of Sec 13(b)(l) pending further clarification by
DOT or the courts, if the warehouse serves such stores exclusively and the
situation is in other res­pects comparable to the chain store situation
discussed in paragraph (c) above.</p><p>(f)   In situations other than those in (b),
(c), (d), and (e) above, the CO shall make every effort to determine the “fixed
and persisting transportation intent” of the shipper by ascertaining from the
information available at the establishment under investigation whether the
three DOT tests are met. In the case of the typical wholesaler or supplier this
will generally present no problem because the facts will be available to show
whether tests (2) and (3) in (a) above are met and the presence or absence of
any transportation intent beyond the importer’s establishment on the part of
the shipper can ordinarily be demonstrated from the importer’s purchase orders,
invoices, and other similar records. In the event the CO is unable to resolve
the question from information available at the establishment under investigation,
he shall make no attempt to contact the shipper. In such situations the matter
shall be referred promptly to the AD and the ARA shall be contacted as
necessary for additional guidance or to consult the RS as appropriate.</p>

              <p>(a)   DOT has held that drivers, driver’s
helpers, loaders, and mechanics engaged in activities which directly affect the
safe operation of motor vehicles in interstate commerce will be subject to its
jurisdiction under Sec 204 of the Motor Carrier Act. This applies to such
employees who are employed by a common, contract, or private carrier which has
engaged in the interstate transportation of goods. In the case of a common
carrier that has solicited interstate transportation business pursuant to a
valid I.C.C. certificate, it would not be necessary to have actually engaged in
the interstate transportation of goods.</p><p>(b)   Where a driver or driver’s helper has not
made an actual interstate trip, or a loader or mechanic has not been working on
an interstate shipment or vehicle which has been utilized in such a shipment,
they may still be subject to DOT’s jurisdiction, if:</p><p>(1) 
The carrier is shown
to have an involvement in interstate commerce and,</p><p>(2) 
It can be established
that the driver or driver’s helper could have, in the regular course of his/her
employment, been reasonably expected to make one of the carrier’s interstate
runs or, in the case of a loader or mechanic, could have been reasonably
expected to perform as such in the carrier’s interstate activity.</p><p>Satisfactory
evidence of the above could take the form of statements from the carrier’s
employees, or documentation such as employment agreements. Where such evidence
is developed with regard to an employee, DOT will assert jurisdiction over that
employee for a 4-month period beginning with the date they could have been
called upon to, or actually did, engage in the carrier’s interstate activity.
Thus, such employees would be exempt under Sec 13(b)(l) for the same 4-month period,
notwithstanding references to the contrary contained in IB 782.2.</p><p>(c)   Where it is not clear whether this
exemption will apply to a carrier’s drivers, driver’s helpers, loaders, and
mechanics, the following information should be developed and forwarded to the
AA/OFLS:</p><p>(1) 
With regard to the
carrier:</p><p>                                             
a.     The extent to which it is involved in
interstate commerce;</p><p>                                             
b.     Evidence, in the case of a common carrier
which has not engaged in interstate transportation, that it has solicited such
business; and</p><p>                                             
c.     Whether it operates pursuant to a valid
ICC certificate.</p><p>(2) 
With regard to the
employees in question:</p><p>                                             
a.     The degree to which their duties affect
the safety of operation of motor vehicles on the public highways in interstate
commerce;</p><p>                                             
b.     The frequency with which they engage in
the duties of a driver, driver’s helper, loader, or mechanic in an interstate
activity; and</p><p>                                             
c.     Evidence that they could be called upon
to perform the duties of a driver, driver’s helper, loader, or mechanic in an
interstate activity.</p><p>(3)

less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.”</p><p>(NOTE: Effective 5/1/75, OT compensation
must be paid for hours worked in excess of 44 per week; and effective 5/1/76,
the exemption is repealed and thus OT compensation must be paid for hours
worked in excess of 40 per week.)</p><p>(b)   Sec 7(n) of the amended Act provides that
in determining the hours of employment of an employee of a transit system or
carrier, the hours worked in “charter activities” shall not be included if</p><p>(1) 
the employee’s
employment in such activities was pursuant to an agreement or understanding

              <h3>24g07  “Local”.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The word “local” modifies only the words
“trolley or motorbus”. The indispensable characteristic of a local motorbus
carrier is that it is a carrier which serves an integrated commercial or industrial
area for the purposes of carrying persons to and from their work in offices and
factories, children to and from school daily, and other persons attending to
necessary routine business. If a carrier does not meet this test, it is not
exempt. On the other hand, the mere serving, as above, of an integrated
commercial area by a carrier would not conclusively establish the fact that
such a carrier is local unless it has generally the following characteristics,
the first three of which are the most significant:</p><p>(1) 
The fare on a local
bus route is either paid to the driver directly or deposited in a coin box.
Tickets are not sold at terminals or other designated places for single trips.
School tickets, weekly passes, or commutation tickets are in some instances,
however, used on local carriers.</p><p>(2) 
The fare on a local
bus route is either a single fare for the entire route, or is based on the
number of zones through which a person travels. The fare is not based on the
number of miles traveled.</p><p>(3) 
Buses of a local
carrier traverse the same route at frequent intervals, usually with a “headway”
of less than 1 hour, and make frequent stops at designated places, ordinarily
spaced at a given number of feet. These operating schedules are generally
speeded up during the morning and evening peak periods.</p><p>(4) 
The buses used on
local routes differ from the over-the-road buses in that the seats in the
former are more narrowly spaced and the aisle is wider to accommodate standees.</p><p>(5) 
Local buses are built
not to exceed a speed of approximately 45 miles per hour, while the top speed
of the over-the-road bus is much higher.</p><p>(6) 
Local buses are
geared for the quick acceleration necessary for short runs in congested
traffic.</p><p>(7) 
Local buses do not
maintain space for baggage, having at best a package rack for small items such
as lunch boxes and packaged merchandise. Over-the-road buses have space set
aside in the rear, on the roof, or within the bus for the luggage commonly
required in traveling considerable distances.</p><p>(8) 
Drivers of local
buses are ordinarily paid on an hourly rather than a mileage basis.</p><p>(9) 
Drivers of local
buses do not make runs which prevent them from returning home each day after
work.</p><p>(10) 
Local bus carriers do
not maintain schedules designed to make connections with over-the-road
carriers, nor are they engaged in carriage which is a continuation of
over-the-road travel, preliminary thereto, or a part thereof.</p><p>(11) 
The statistical
pattern of national over-the-road travel indicates a falling off of business
during the fall, winter, and early spring months with a sharp increase during
the late spring months and summer traceable to pleasure trips taken during
vacation periods. The statistical pattern for local bus travel depicts a low
degree of travel during the late spring months and summer.</p><p>(b)   The crossing of State lines does not of
itself change the local character of a carrier if the tests set out in (a)
above are met.</p>

characteristics of a local trolley or motorbus carrier, as those terms are
used, minor dis­crepancies will not defeat the Sec l3(b)(7) exemption (nor did
they defeat the exemptions provided by old Sec l3(b)(7) or old Sec 13 (a)(9)).

character, do not fall within the new Sec l3(b)(7) (or old Sec l3(b)(7) or old
Sec 13 (a)(9)) exemption, which was intended to include only those trolley or
motorbus carriers rendering daily common passenger service as part of the

these services are not rendered to the public at large as part of the available

contractual hauling activities of a motorbus carrier, whether such hauling be
of persons or property, are performing nonexempt work under Sec l3(b)(7) (and

              <p>(a)   Charter activities which meet the
statutory tests of Sec 7(n) are excluded from “hours worked” for OT purposes (see
also FOH 24g00(b) and (c)). Thus, only the time spent in charter activities
which begins outside the employee’s ordinary workday or w/w is excludable under
7(n). Where such a charter is of such duration that it carries over to the next
workday or w/w, such work continues to be excludable provided the employee is
relieved from duty at the conclusion of the charter until the next workday begins.
Any charter activity performed in a regular workday or w/w (i.e., which begins
in any part of the regular workday or w/w), must be included in “hours worked”
for OT purposes.</p><p>(b)   The fact that a transit system regularly
engages in charter work does not preclude the use of Sec 7(n). The term
“regular” as used in Sec 7(n) relates to the employee’s activities, not the
employer’s.</p><p>(c)   Sums paid for charter activities would be

              <p>(a)   Old Sec 13(a)(12), prior to 2/l/67,
provided a MW and OT exemption for “any employee of an employer engaged in the
business of operating taxicabs”. Since the old Sec 13(a)(12) exemption extended
to all employees whose work is performed in connection with the employer’s
taxicab business, it would include drivers, dispatchers, office workers,
mechanics, etc. Employment which became subject to the MW provisions by virtue
of the repeal of old Sec 13(a)(12) is subject to the Sec 6(b) rate.</p><p>(b)   Tolerance for nonexempt work. Nonexempt
work, for purposes of old Sec 13(a)(12), is work which is not normally
considered a part of the taxicab business . However, for enforcement purposes,
the exemption shall be deemed applicable even though some nonexempt work is per­formed
by a particular employee during the w/w, unless the amount of such nonexempt
work is substantial. The amount of nonexempt work will be considered
substantial if it occupies more than 20% of the time worked by the employee
during the w/w. (See IB 786, Subpart E.) Examples of nonexempt work include:</p><p>(1) 
the transfer of
baggage or freight which is not performed in conjunction with and as an
incident to the transportation of persons in the same vehicle;</p><p>(2) 
work performed in
connection with garage and repair services on vehicles other than those used in
the employer’s taxicab business; or</p><p>(3) 
work performed in
connection with other business operations of the employer (i.e. not his taxicab
operations) such as the operation of an airport limousine service (see FOH

              <h3>24i01   Scope of the FLSA Sec 13(b)(2) exemption.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The provisions of Part I of the Interstate
Commerce Act apply only to common carriers engaged in interstate commerce in
the transportation of passengers or property wholly by railroad, or partly by
railroad and partly by water when both are under common control, management, or
arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment. Employers in this category
include railroad carriers, express companies, sleeping car companies, and
refrigerator car companies. (Prior to 5/1/74, the exemption also applied to
employees of common carriers engaged in interstate commerce by pipeline (except
carriers of water or of natural or artificial gas).)</p><p>(b)   In the foregoing paragraph, the words
“common control, management, or arrangement” may include a common understanding
between carriers as to traffic policy, even though the separate corporate
entities of the carriers may be maintained.  For example, a car ferry company
which maintains its own carriage distinct and independent by having separate
contracts, independent rates, and receiving direct instructions from the
shippers concerning carriage by it, is not under common control, management, or
arrangement with another carrier. If, however, the transportation by a railroad
and such a ferry company is covered by a through bill of lading, or by through
rates or charges, or if there is any other arrangement indicating a common
traffic policy by the two companies, the ferry company may be an employer
subject to Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act.</p><p>(c)   The exemption applies only to those
employees who perform activities which subject their employer to Part I of the
Interstate Commerce Act.</p><p>(d)   The term “employer”, as used in the
exemption, refers to the person or persons who would be legally obligated to
pay OT wages, if not specifically exempted therefrom.</p><p>(e)   Employees of an employer who leases
refrigerator and tank cars to railroads and shippers for the interstate
transportation of goods are exempt from the requirements of the FLSA under Sec
13(b)(2).</p><p>(f)   Employees of an independent railroad
contractor engaged in laying and grading track and other maintenance of way
operations are not within the Sec 13(b)(2) exemption, even though the railroad
exercises jurisdiction over the manner in which the work is performed and gives
written approval for the wages and OT paid employees by the independent
contractor. The contractor, being engaged in construction work for a railroad,
is not an employer subject to Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act.</p><p>(g)   Employees of a railroad contractor,
engaged in maintaining and servicing air-conditioning and car-lighting
equipment sold to railroads, are not within the Sec 13(b)(2) exemption since
the contractor is neither a common carrier nor engaged in transportation in
interstate commerce. The fact that a railroad contractor may be subject to the
Railroad Retirement Act or the Railway Labor Act is not a criterion for
determining the application of the Sec 13 (b)(2) exemption.</p>

manufacturing ice are within the Sec 13(b)(2) exemption where the ice is made
solely for use by the railroad.</p><p>(b)   The loading and unloading of livestock by
employees of a public stockyard onto and from railroad cars is within the Sec
13(b)(2) exemption, but other stockyard activities, such as the yarding,
feeding, watering, and handling of livestock before or after the loading or
unloading operations, are not within the exemption.</p><p>(c)   For purposes of the old Sec l3(b)(2)
exemption during the period prior to 5/1/74, employees of a carrier engaged in
the transportation of oil by pipeline within a State as part of an interstate
system of transportation (or connecting with such a transportation system),
uninterrupted by processing, were within Sec l3(b)(2) because such activities
are subject to regulation under Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act. This was
true even though a firm was transporting only its own products in its own
pipeline or gathering system since the term “common carrier” in such Act
included all pipelines. (A line laid on an oil lease to move crude oil from the
well-head to a lease storage tank, or from one lease storage tank to another,
is not considered to be a “common carrier”.)</p><p>(d)   For the period prior to 5/1/74,

              <h3>24j01   Application of the carrier-by-air exemption.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The exemption under Sec 13(b)(3) is not
an industry or establishment exemption. It applies to individual employees of an
air carrier when their activities bear a reasonably close relationship to the
exempt type of transportation activities which bring the employer’s operation
under Title II of the Railway Labor Act. Title II applies to “every common
carrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign commerce, and every carrier by
air transporting mail for or under contract with the United States Government,
and every air pilot or other person who performs any work as an employee or
subordinate official of such carrier or carriers, subject to its or their
continuing authority to supervise and direct the manner of rendition of his
service”. The performance of nonexempt work will defeat the exemption where
such work exceeds 20% of the employee’s total work during a w/w (see IB 786, Subpart
A).</p><p>(b)   Work performed by mechanics on training
planes, transient planes, and on planes other than those used in operations
which subject the employer to Title II of the Railway Labor Act clearly has no
relation to exempt air transportation and would, if it constituted a
substantial part of their work, defeat the exemption. Flyers and other
employees who operate a flying school also perform nonexempt work, as do
employees who sell airplanes and parts.</p>

              <p>The National Mediation Board has taken
the position that any carrier that has been issued an air taxi and commercial
operations (ATCO) certificate or an ATCO letter of registration by the Federal
Aviation Administration and is engaged in interstate operations is a common
carrier by air and subject to Title II of the Railway Labor Act. Thus, commuter
airline pilots and air taxi pilots employed by such carriers may be subject to
the Sec 13(b)(3) exemption. The Board does not assert jurisdiction over solely
intrastate operations when there is no significant carriage of mail.</p>

              <p>Employees of an air carrier who supply
food and meal service equipment such as thermos jugs, ovens, food racks, food
trays, silverware, napkins, china, and the like, to airlines for use on the
airplane are exempt under Sec 13(b)(3). Such employees are engaged in operating
equipment and facilities and per­forming services in connection with
transportation and handling of property transported by airlines. The exemption,
however, applies only to those employees of such a carrier engaged in work of a
nature which brings their employer within Title II of the Railway Labor Act.
Work performed by such a carrier which does not bear a reasonably close
relationship to the transportation activities that give rise to the exemption
will be regarded as nonexempt work and a substantial amount of nonexempt work
(more than 20% of the time worked by the employee during the w/w) will result
in loss of the exemption.</p>
