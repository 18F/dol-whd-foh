<h4 id="a00---purpose.">46a00 - Purpose. </h4>
<p>The H-2B provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provide for the admission of nonimmigrants to the United States to perform temporary non-agricultural labor or services. See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101'>8 USC § 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b)</a>. This chapter provides information on regulations and interpretations with respect to the Wage and Hour Division’s (WHD) enforcement authority under the H-2B nonimmigrant program.</p>
<h4 id="a01---h-2b-petition-process.">46a01 - H-2B petition process. </h4>
<h4 id="a02---enforcement-authority.">46a02 - Enforcement authority.</h4>
<p>Effective January 18, 2009, WHD was delegated enforcement authority from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under INA § 214(c)(14)(A). This includes authority to impose administrative remedies on an employer who substantially fails to meet any of the conditions of the petition to admit or provide status to an H-2B worker or who willfully misrepresents a material fact on such petition. The regulations for this program are in <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/null'>20 CFR Part 655</a> Subpart A. Questions or complaints concerning the H-2B program should be directed to the nearest Wage and Hour Division District Office. See http://www.dol.gov/whd/america2.htm.</p>
<p>On February 21, 2012, the Department issued new Final Rule for the H-2B program. 77 FR 10038. On April 26, 2012, the Final Rule was preliminarily enjoined by the court in Bayou Lawn &amp; Landscape Servs. v. Solis, No. 3:12-cv-00183-MC-CJK, slip op. (N.D. Fla. Apr. 26, 2012), appeal docketed, No. 12-12462 (11th Cir. May 15, 2012). The 2008 H-2B regulations were not at issue and are not affected by the district court's preliminary decision in Bayou Lawn. Rather, as the district court explained, its preliminary injunction had the effect of &quot;preserving the status quo&quot; of the 2008 rules. Bayou Lawn, Slip. Op. at 7. This FOH Chapter relates to the 2008 rules only.</p>

<p>The Department of Labor (DOL) does not certify to USCIS the temporary employment of H2B workers, or enforce compliance with the provisions of the H-2B visa program, in the Territory of Guam. The administration of the H-2B temporary labor certification program is performed by the Governor of Guam, or the Governor's designated representative.

<li><p>Union. If the employer is party to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) governing the job classification, the employer must formally contact the local union as a recruitment source for able, willing, qualified, and available U.S. workers. This contact may be made by U.S. mail or other effective means during the period of time that the job order is being circulated for clearance by the SWA.

<li><p>Multiple worksites. Employers may not include more than one area of intended employment on a single 9142, with the exception of itinerant reforestation and entertainment employers, which are covered by ETA special procedures that are explained below. If the employer has multiple worksites within a single area of intended employment, the workers may be employed at any of the worksites provided the job duties are identical and the employer has listed all of the worksites on the 9142 in section F Job Offer Information, subsection c Place of Employment. The employer must provide enough geographic detail to cover all the intended worksites.</p></li>
<li><p>Itineraries.  Employers in the reforestation and entertainment industries have been granted special procedures by ETA per <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/655.3'>20 CFR 655.3</a> permitting them to place H-2B workers in multiple areas of intended employment, based on a multi-state itinerary. See Training and Employment Guidance Letters No. 31-05 (issued May 31, 2006) and No. 27-06 (issued June 12, 2007). Employers who will work H-2B workers on an itinerary must attach the itinerary to the 9142.  The employer must list all of the work locations and the duration of work at each location.  ETA requires the employer to recruit only in one area of intended employment, typically the area where the work begins. The employer is required to pay the appropriate prevailing wage at each work location as identified on the ETA 9141, Application for Prevailing Wage Determination.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The H-2B employer makes a written, bona fide inquiry as to whether the secondary/other employer has displaced or intends to displace any similarly employed U.S. workers within the area of intended employment beginning 120 days before through 120 calendar days after the date of need. The H-2B job contractor employer must secure a written confirmation from such secondary/other employer that the employer has not displaced and does not intend to displace any similarly employed U.S. workers within the area of intended employment, and</p></li>
<li><p>All worksites where H-2B workers will be placed are listed on the Application for Temporary Employment Certification. See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/655.22'>20 CFR 655.22(k)</a> and Appendix B.1 - Condition 14.</p></li>

See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/655.22'>20 CFR 655.22(e)</a>. The offered wage listed on the Application for Temporary Employment Certification must meet this requirement, and the offered wage (including any offered overtime wage rate) must be paid to H-2B workers and similarly employed U.S. workers who were hired during the 10 day recruitment period. See FOH 46b04(b).

<li><p>“Deduction” means any amount by which the H-2B worker’s cash wages are decreased. A deduction may be shown on the payroll records, marked as a deduction or a wage credit (e.g., FICA, housing). However, a deduction will also be considered to exist where the H-2B worker’s cash wages have been decreased through out-of-pocket expenditures made by the H-2B worker for business expenses of the H-2B employer incurred in obtaining the worker's H-2B status. Such expenses include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Attorney's or agent's fees incurred for any activity related to the Application for Temporary Employment Certification or petition filing.</p></li>

</ol></li>
<li><p>A wage violation will exist where a deduction causes the cash wage to fall below the required wage, unless the deduction is made in accordance with the H-2B regulations. If the H-2B worker receives the required wage despite the deduction, there is no violation.</p></li>
<li><p>The employer must make all deductions from the worker's wages that are required by law (e.g., income tax and FICA).</p></li>
<li><p>The H-2B employer may make deductions not required by law if such deductions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Are specified in the job offer,</p></li>
<li><p>Are reasonable (the employer may not profit from the deduction), and</p></li>
<li><p>Do not violate federal, state, or local law.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Fees paid to USCIS when filing a Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (Form I-129) may not be deducted to the extent they reduce the worker's wages to below the required wage. Such fees include:</p>

<li><p>A basic filing fee of $320.00,</p></li>
<li><p>An additional premium processing fee of $1,000.00 if expedited processing is requested, and</p></li>

<li><p>The statute requires that the employer pay the reasonable cost of the H-2B's return transportation to his/her last place of residence abroad if the employer terminates the worker prior to the end of the approved status. See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1184'>8 USC 1184(c)(5)</a>.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The H-2B regulations allow employers to receive reimbursement for certain specific costs, including government required passport and visa fees. Under the FLSA, visa fees are an employer business expense. Consequently, H-2B employers that are covered under the FLSA may not make deductions that would bring the employee below the FLSA minimum wage. See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/655.22'>20 CFR 655.22(g)</a>, see also Field Assistance Bulletin 2009-2 available at: http://www.dol.gov/whd/FieldBulletins/FieldAssistanceBulletin2009_2.htm</p></li>
<li><p>FLSA Minimum Wage. Under the FLSA, the employer is liable for the inbound transportation of the H-2B worker and the outbound transportation when the worker's H-2B status has ended. If failure to pay such transportation costs results in a failure to pay the FLSA minimum wage in a non-overtime initial or terminal workweek or the regular rate in an overtime workweek, there is an FLSA wage violation for the affected initial or terminal workweek(s). See Field Assistance Bulletin 2009-2.</p></li>
<li><p>FLSA Overtime (OT) Pay. Where the FLSA OT requirement is applicable, the 40-hour workweek/time-and-one-half standard will be used to determine whether the worker has been properly paid. Premium pay is based on the H-2B employee's regular rate of pay, which can be no less than the required/offered wage.</p></li>

<h4 id="d00---authority-of-whd.">46d00 - Authority of WHD. </h4>
<p>Pursuant to the delegation of authority from the Secretary of Homeland Security to the Secretary of Labor, the WHD will, either pursuant to a complaint or otherwise, conduct investigations to determine compliance with the H-2B requirements. In connection with such investigations, WHD may enter any places, inspect any records (and make transcriptions and copies thereof), question persons, and gather any information deemed necessary to determine the status of compliance. See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/655.50'>20 CFR 655.50(a)</a> &amp; (b).</p>
<h4 id="d01---employer-cooperation.">46d01 - Employer cooperation.</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>An employer being investigated shall make available to the WHI: records, information, persons and places as deemed appropriate to copy, transcribe, question, or inspect.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the records are maintained at the central recordkeeping office, other than the place or places of employment, such records must be made available for inspection and copying within 72 hours following notice from the WHI.</p></li>
<li><p>H-2B employers are required to develop and maintain certain employment records to support their compliance with the attestations made on the Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
