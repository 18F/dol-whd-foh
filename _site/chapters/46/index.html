              <p>The H-2B provisions of the Immigration and
Nationality Act (INA) provide for the admission of nonimmigrants to the United
States to perform temporary non-agricultural labor or services. See 8 USC §
1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b). This chapter provides information on regulations and
interpretations with respect to the Wage and Hour Division’s (WHD) enforcement authority

              <h3>46a01 - H-2B petition process.</h3>
              <p>(a)   ETA. The H-2B
petition process begins when the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) certifies
that the prospective H-2B employer performed the required recruitment and was
unable to obtain sufficient numbers of qualified U.S. workers to meet its
temporary employment need. The ETA certifying officer (CO) reviews the complete
Application for Temporary Employment Certification ETA Form 9142 and Appendix B.1
and makes a determination to certify or deny the application. ETA may issue a
Request for Further Information (RFI) to, or at its discretion conduct an audit
of, the employer if ETA believes the employer has not established its need or
met its domestic recruitment obligations. Included within ETA jurisdiction are
determinations related to such issues as justification and appropriate classification
of the temporary need, availability of U.S. workers, positive recruitment,
prevailing wage determinations, methodology for establishing the prevailing
wage, and similar matters.</p><p>(b)   DHS/USCIS. After
obtaining a certified Application from ETA the employer then submits a petition
to Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
(USCIS). USCIS reviews the petition which includes the certified Application
for Temporary Employment Certification and the DHS Form I-129, Petition for a
Nonimmigrant Worker.  USCIS either approves or denies the petition.</p><p>(c)   DOS. After the
employer has an adjudicated petition from the USCIS, the Department of State
(DOS) issues the visa to the H-2B workers. </p>

              <h3>46a02 - Enforcement authority.</h3>
              <p>Effective January 18, 2009, WHD was delegated
enforcement authority from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under INA
§ 214(c)(14)(A). This includes authority to impose administrative remedies on
an employer who substantially fails to meet any of the conditions of the
petition to admit or provide status to an H-2B worker or who willfully
misrepresents a material fact on such petition. The regulations for this
program are in 20 CFR Part 655 Subpart A. Questions or complaints concerning
the H-2B program should be directed to the nearest Wage and Hour Division
District Office. See http://www.dol.gov/whd/america2.htm. </p><p>On February 21, 2012, the Department issued new Final
Rule for the H-2B program.  77 FR 10038.  On April 26, 2012, the Final Rule was
preliminarily enjoined by the court in Bayou Lawn &amp; Landscape Servs. v.
Solis, No. 3:12-cv-00183-MC-CJK, slip op. (N.D. Fla. Apr. 26, 2012), appeal
docketed, No. 12-12462 (11th Cir. May 15, 2012).  The 2008 H-2B regulations
were not at issue and are not affected by the district court's preliminary
decision in Bayou Lawn.  Rather, as the district court explained, its
preliminary injunction had the effect of &quot;preserving the status quo&quot;
of the 2008 rules.  Bayou Lawn, Slip. Op. at 7.  This FOH Chapter relates to
the 2008 rules only.   </p>

temporary, regardless of whether the underlying job is permanent or temporary. See
20 CFR 655.6. The employer must provide a detailed statement regarding its

              <h3>46b02 - Pre-filing obligations – recruitment.</h3>
              <p>(a)   General recruitment
obligations. Prior to filing the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification, an employer must perform all necessary steps of the recruitment
process as specified in 20 CFR 655.15. The employer's signature on the Application
for Temporary Employment Certification attests that:</p><p>(1)  It has completed
recruitment and found no or insufficient qualified U.S. workers to meet its
temporary need,  and</p><p>(2)  That any eligible
U.S. workers who applied for temporary or seasonal employment were either hired
or rejected for lawful, job-related reasons. </p><p>(b)   Prevailing wage.
The H-2B employer first must obtain a prevailing wage determination (PWD) from
ETA by submitting an ETA Form 9141, Application for Prevailing Wage
Determination. Prevailing wage requests are handled by the ETA National Processing
Center (NPC). Information concerning PWDs may be found at http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/contacts.cfm.
See 20 CFR 655.10.</p><p>(1)  The NPC will enter the
prevailing wage on the form, indicate the source and validity period, and
return the certified prevailing wage (electronically or by mail) to the employer.
The employer must offer this wage (or higher) to both its H‑2B workers and any
similarly employed U.S. workers hired in response to the recruitment required
as part of the Application for Temporary Employment Certification application. See
20 CFR 655.10(b)(6). “Similarly employed” means having substantially comparable
jobs in the occupational category in the area of intended employment. See 20 CFR
655.10(c).</p><p>(2)  No PWD issued for use
on an Application for Temporary Employment Certification permits an employer to
pay a wage lower than the highest wage required by any applicable federal, state,
or local law. See 20 CFR 655.10(h).</p><p>(c)   Job order. The
employer must submit a job order to the State Workforce Agency (SWA) serving
the area of intended employment no more than 120 calendar days before the
employer’s date of need for H-2B workers, identifying it as a job order to be
placed in connection with a future Application for Temporary Employment
Certification. See 20 CFR 655.15(e).</p><p>(d)   Advertisements.
The employer must publish two print advertisements for the job which must
contain terms and conditions of employment which are not less favorable than
those to be offered to the H-2B workers and must satisfy all of the following
requirements:</p><p>(1)  During the period of time
that the job order is being circulated for clearance by the SWA, the
advertisement must appear on two separate days (may be consecutive) in a
newspaper of general circulation serving the area of intended employment. The
newspaper must have a reasonable distribution and be appropriate to the
occupation and the workers likely to apply for the job opportunity.</p><p>(2)  One of the advertisements
must be a Sunday advertisement unless the job opportunity is located in a rural
area that does not have a newspaper with a Sunday edition; in such a case the
H-2B employer must, in place of a Sunday edition advertisement, advertise in
the regularly published daily edition with the widest circulation in the area
of intended employment.</p><p>(3)  If a professional,
trade, or ethnic publication is more appropriate than a general circulation
newspaper for the occupation or the type of workers likely to apply for the job,
and it is the source most likely to bring responses from able, available, and
qualified U.S. workers, the H‑2B employer may use a professional, trade, or
ethnic publication in place of one of the newspaper advertisements, but may not
to replace the Sunday advertisement.</p><p>See 20 CFR 655.15 and 655.17</p><p>(e)   Union. If the
employer is party to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) governing the job
classification, the employer must formally contact the local union as a
recruitment source for able, willing, qualified, and available U.S. workers. This
contact may be made by U.S. mail or other effective means during the period of
time that the job order is being circulated for clearance by the SWA. See 20 CFR
655.15(g).</p><p>(f)   Layoffs. If the
H-2B employer has laid off U.S. workers in the occupation and area of intended
employment within 120 days of the first date an H‑2B worker is needed as
indicated on the Application for Temporary Employment Certification, the
employer must document that it has notified or will notify each laid-off worker
of the job opportunity and that it has considered or will consider each laid off
worker who expressed interest in the job opportunity, and the result of the
notification and consideration. See 20 CFR 655.15(h).</p><p>(g)   Recruitment
Report. Per guidelines specified in 20 CFR 655.15(j) the H-2B employer must
prepare, sign, and date a written recruitment report. The recruitment report
must be submitted to the NPC with the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification application.</p><p>(h)  Recruitment Records.
The employer filing the Application must maintain documentation of its
advertising and recruitment efforts for a period of no less than three years
from the date of the certification or from the date of determination if the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification is denied or withdrawn.
Documentation includes:</p><p>(1)  A copy of the
recruitment report,</p><p>(2)  Prevailing wage
documentation,</p><p>(3)  Resumes of and
evidence of contact with each U.S. worker who applied or was referred to the
job opportunity,</p><p>(4)  Dated logs
demonstrating that the labor union was contacted and notified of the position
openings and whether it referred qualified U.S. workers, the number of
referrals (if any) or whether the union was non-responsive to the notification,
and</p><p>(5)  Copies of newspaper
pages, tear sheets of the publication pages, or other proof containing the full
text and dates of the advertisements. </p>

              <h3>46b04 - Employer obligations - Application for Temporary Employment
Certification Appendix B.1.</h3>
              <p>An employer seeking to
employ H-2B workers declares by its signature on the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification that it will meet the conditions of employment in
Appendix B.1.</p><p>(a)   The job opportunity
must:</p><p>(1)  Be a bona fide,
full-time temporary position with qualifications that are consistent with normal
and accepted qualifications required by non-H‑2B employers in the same or comparable
occupations. See 20 CFR 655.22(h)</p><p>(2)  Not be vacant due to
a strike, lockout, or work stoppage in the course of a labor dispute. See 20 CFR
655.22(b).</p><p>(3)  Be open to any
qualified U.S. worker regardless of race, color, national origin, age, sex,
religion, handicap, or citizenship, and the employer has conducted the required
recruitment, contacted the union and retained records of any U.S. applicant(s)
and the disposition of the application(s). See 20 CFR 655.22(c) and Appendix B
- Conditions 1-3.</p><p>(b)   The job offer
must:</p><p>(1)  Include terms and
working conditions normal to U.S. workers similarly employed in the area of
intended employment and no less favorable than those offered to H-2B workers
and not less than the minimum required terms and conditions. See 20 CFR
655.22(a).</p><p>(2)  Include an offered
wage that equals or exceeds the highest of the prevailing wage, the applicable federal,
state, or local minimum wage, and the employer must pay the offered wage during
the entire period of the approved Application for Temporary Employment
Certification. See 20 CFR 655.22(e).</p><p>(3)  Not be based on
commissions, bonuses, or other incentives, unless the employer guarantees a
wage paid on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis that equals or exceeds the prevailing
wage or the legal federal, state, or local minimum wage, whichever is highest. See
20 CFR 655.22(g)(1).</p><p>(4)  Specify all
deductions not required by law. See 20 CFR 655.22(g)(1) and Appendix B.1 -
Conditions 4-6.</p><p>(c)   Compliance with
other laws. The employer must comply with applicable federal, state, and local
employment-related laws and regulations, including employment-related health
and safety laws. See 20 CFR 655.22(d) and Appendix B.1 - Condition 7.</p><p>(d)   Layoffs. The
employer is prohibited, with certain exceptions, from laying off any similarly
employed U.S. workers in the occupation that is the subject of the Application
for Temporary Employment Certification in the area of intended employment
beginning 120 calendar days before the date of requested need of the first H-2B
workers through 120 calendar days after the date of need. Layoffs are permitted
where the H-2B employer has offered the job to the laid-off U.S. workers and
the U.S. workers refused the job or the U.S. worker was rejected for the job for
lawful, job-related reasons. See 20 CFR § 655.22(i) and Appendix B.1 -
Condition 8.</p><p>(e)   Fee Recovery.</p><p>(1)  The H-2B employer and
its attorney or agents are prohibited from receiving payment of any kind from an
employee for any activity related to obtaining the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification, including payment of the H-2B employer’s attorney or
agent fees, any fees related to the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification, or recruitment costs. Payments include, but are not limited to,
monetary payments, deductions from wages, salary or benefits, kickbacks,
bribes, and free labor See 20 CFR 655.22(j) and Appendix B.1 - Condition 9.</p><p>(2)  FLSA covered employer
with H-2B workers who are not exempt from the FLSA are also responsible for
paying these H-2B workers’ visa fees to the extent that the fees would bring
the worker below the minimum wage. See FOH 46c02.</p><p>(f)   Separation from
Employment Notifications.</p><p>(1)  Upon the separation
from employment of any H-2B workers employed under the Application for
Temporary Employment Certification prior to the end date of the employment
specified in the Application for Temporary Employment Certification, the H-2B
employer must notify ETA and USCIS in writing of the separation from employment
not later than two work days after separation is discovered. See 20 CFR
655.22(f).</p><p>(2)  If an H-2B worker is
dismissed by the H-2B employer prior to the end of the period, the H-2B
employer is liable for return transportation.  If the H-2B employer is required,
as a part of the pilot program referenced in § 655.35, it must inform the H-2B
worker of the requirement to leave the United States at the end of the
authorized period of stay or separation from the employer, whichever is earlier,
unless the H‑2B worker will be sponsored by another subsequent employer.  See 8
USC 1184(c)(5); 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(vi)(E); 20 CFR 655.22(m); and Appendix B.1 -
Conditions 10-11.</p><p>(g)   Area of
Intended Employment.</p><p>(1)  The employer will not
place any H-2B workers employed pursuant to the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification outside the area of intended employment listed on the Application
for Temporary Employment Certification unless the employer has obtained a new Application
from ETA. See 20 CFR 655.22(l) and Appendix B.1 - Condition 12.</p><p>(2)  “Area of intended
employment” means the geographic area within normal commuting distance of the
place (worksite address) of intended employment of the job opportunity for
which the certification is sought. See 20 CFR § 655.4.</p><p>a.     An H-2B
worker may have more than one worksite during a certified period of employment.</p><p>1.     Multiple
worksites. Employers may not include more than one area of intended
employment on a single 9142, with the exception of itinerant reforestation and
entertainment employers, which are covered by ETA special procedures that are
explained below.  If the employer has multiple worksites within a single area
of intended employment, the workers may be employed at any of the worksites
provided the job duties are identical and the employer has listed all of the
worksites on the 9142 in section F Job Offer Information, subsection c Place of
Employment. The employer must provide enough geographic detail to cover all the
intended worksites.</p><p>2.     Itineraries. 
Employers in the reforestation and entertainment industries have been granted
special procedures by ETA per 20 CFR 655.3 permitting them to place H-2B
workers in multiple areas of intended employment, based on a multi-state
itinerary. See Training and Employment Guidance Letters No. 31-05 (issued May
31, 2006) and No. 27-06 (issued June 12, 2007). Employers who will work H-2B
workers on an itinerary must attach the itinerary to the 9142.  The
employer must list all of the work locations and the duration of work at each
location.  ETA requires the employer to recruit only in one area of
intended employment, typically the area where the work begins. The employer is
required to pay the appropriate prevailing wage at each work location as
identified on the ETA 9141, Application for Prevailing Wage Determination.</p><p>b.     An
employer cannot apply for H-2B workers for a job opportunity at a worksite and
in an occupation in which U.S. workers are on strike or locked out. See 20 CFR
655.22(b) and Appendix B - Condition 2.</p><p>(h)  Temporary Need. The
H-2B employer must accurately state the dates of temporary need, reasons for
temporary need, and number of positions being requested for labor certification.
See 20 CFR 655.22(n) and Appendix B.1 - Condition 13.</p><p>(i)    Secondary
Displacement. An H-2B employer that is a job contractor is prohibited from
placing an H-2B worker at a worksite of a secondary/other employer unless:</p><p>(1)  The H-2B employer
makes a written, bona fide inquiry as to whether the secondary/other employer
has displaced or intends to displace any similarly employed U.S. workers within
the area of intended employment beginning 120 days before through 120 calendar
days after the date of need. The H-2B job contractor employer must secure a
written confirmation from such secondary/other employer that the employer has
not displaced and does not intend to displace any similarly employed U.S.
workers within the area of intended employment, and</p><p>(2)  All worksites where
H-2B workers will be placed are listed on the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification. See 20 CFR 655.22(k) and Appendix B.1 - Condition 14.</p>

              <h3>46c00 - Required/offered wage rate.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The H-2B
employer is required to pay at least the highest of the prevailing wage, federal,
state, or local minimum wages. See 20 CFR 655.22(e). The offered wage listed on
the Application for Temporary Employment Certification must meet this
requirement, and the offered wage (including any offered overtime wage rate) must
be paid to H-2B workers and similarly employed U.S. workers who were hired
during the 10 day recruitment period. See FOH 46b04(b).  Additionally, if an
employer does not comply with 20 CFR § 655.22(n) and willfully places workers
outside the area of intended employment or in occupations not certified on the ETA
Form 9142, the employer is still obligated to pay the higher of the rate listed
on the 9142 or the prevailing wage in the location or occupation where the
employee is actually working.</p><p>(b)   Satisfaction of
wage obligation. Except as discussed below, the H-2B worker must be paid
his/her wages, free and clear, when due at the end of the pay period in which
the hours of work are performed.</p><p>(c)   Facilities
furnished to H-2B workers.</p><p>(1)  Deductions must be
specified in the H-2B job offer, and all deductions must be reasonable.</p><p>(2)  An employer may take
a “wage credit” (i.e., may reduce or make a deduction from the cash payment of
the required/offered wage) for facilities that are primarily for the benefit of
the H-2B worker.</p><p>(3)  Housing and food allowances
are generally considered to be for the primary benefit of the worker.</p><p>(4)  The wage credit
(deduction) for facilities cannot exceed the fair market value or the actual
cost to the employer of the facility (whichever is lower) and must be
documented by the H-2B employer. See 29 CFR Part 531.</p>

              <h3>46c01 - Deductions.</h3>
              <p>(a)   “Deduction”
means any amount by which the H-2B worker’s cash wages are decreased. A
deduction may be shown on the payroll records, marked as a deduction or a wage
credit (e.g., FICA, housing). However, a deduction will also be considered to
exist where the H-2B worker’s cash wages have been decreased through
out-of-pocket expenditures made by the H-2B worker for business expenses of the
H-2B employer incurred in obtaining the worker's H-2B status. Such expenses
include:</p><p>(1)  Attorney's or agent's
fees incurred for any activity related to the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification or petition filing.</p><p>(2)  Recruitment costs,
including the cost of advertising or payment to a foreign or domestic
recruitment service.</p><p>(3)  A discussion of the
FLSA’s impact on visa fees and inbound and outbound transportation for H-2B
workers is set forth in FOH 46c01(f) and 46c02.</p><p>(b)   A wage
violation will exist where a deduction causes the cash wage to fall below the
required wage, unless the deduction is made in accordance with the H-2B
regulations. If the H-2B worker receives the required wage despite the
deduction, there is no violation.</p><p>(c)   The employer
must make all deductions from the worker's wages that are required by law (e.g.,
income tax and FICA).</p><p>(d)   The H-2B
employer may make deductions not required by law if such deductions:</p><p>(1)  Are specified in the
job offer,</p><p>(2)  Are reasonable (the
employer may not profit from the deduction), and</p><p>(3)  Do not violate federal,
state, or local law.</p><p>(e)   Fees paid to
USCIS when filing a Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (Form I-129) may not be
deducted to the extent they reduce the worker's wages to below the required
wage. Such fees include:</p><p>(1)  A basic filing fee of
$320.00,</p><p>(2)  An additional premium
processing fee of $1,000.00 if expedited processing is requested, and</p><p>(3)  A “fraud prevention
and detection fee” of $150.00 mandated by the Save Our Small and Seasonal
Business Act of 2005 (SOBA) to be paid by all H-2B petitioning employers.</p><p>(f)   The statute
requires that the employer pay the reasonable cost of the H-2B's return
transportation to his/her last place of residence abroad if the employer
terminates the worker prior to the end of the approved status. See 8 USC
1184(c)(5).</p>

              <h3>46c02 - Effect of the FLSA.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The H-2B
regulations allow employers to receive reimbursement for certain specific
costs, including government required passport and visa fees. Under the FLSA,
visa fees are an employer business expense. Consequently, H-2B employers that
are covered under the FLSA may not make deductions that would bring the
employee below the FLSA minimum wage. See 20 CFR 655.22(g), see also Field
Assistance Bulletin 2009-2 available at:  http://www.dol.gov/whd/FieldBulletins/FieldAssistanceBulletin2009_2.htm</p><p>(b)   FLSA Minimum
Wage.  Under the FLSA, the employer is liable for the inbound transportation of
the H-2B worker and the outbound transportation when the worker's H-2B status
has ended. If failure to pay such transportation costs results in a failure to
pay the FLSA minimum wage in a non-overtime initial or terminal workweek or the
regular rate in an overtime workweek, there is an FLSA wage violation for the
affected initial or terminal workweek(s). See Field Assistance Bulletin 2009-2.</p><p>(c)   FLSA Overtime
(OT) Pay. Where the FLSA OT requirement is applicable, the 40-hour workweek/time-and-one-half
standard will be used to determine whether the worker has been properly paid. Premium
pay is based on the H-2B employee's regular rate of pay, which can be no less
than the required/offered wage.</p>

are required to develop and maintain certain employment records to support
their compliance with the attestations made on the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification. These records include those specifically required by
the H-2B program as well as those required by the FLSA for covered employers,

for a period of no less than three years from the date of certification or from
the date of determination if the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification is denied or withdrawn, so they are available in the event they
are requested in an ETA request for further information (RFI) or audit, or a
WHD investigation.</p><p>(d)   No employer or
representative or agent of an employer shall interfere with any official of DOL
who is performing an investigation, inspection, or law enforcement function.
Any such interference shall be a violation of the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification and regulations. See 20 CFR 655.50(c).</p><p>(e)   The WHD shall,
to the extent possible under existing law, protect the confidentiality of any
person who provides information in the course of an investigation. See 20 CFR 655.50(d).
