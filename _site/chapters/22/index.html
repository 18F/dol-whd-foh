              <p>The
exemptions provided by 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) are applied on the basis that each
workweek constitutes a separate period of exemption.  However, certain of the
tests are so worded that a determination of exemption must be made by
considering the conditions of employment over a more extended period of time. 
For example, the “primary duty” test does not expressly apply on a workweek
basis and must be applied using a holistic approach that is sufficient to
capture the character of the employee’s job as a whole (29 CFR § 541.700; 69 FR
22186), rather than a day-by-day scrutiny of the tasks performed.  Similarly,
an employee may be paid the salary required during certain workweeks, but an
analysis of the compensation paid over a longer period may reveal that the
employee is not actually paid “on a salary basis.”  Likewise, investigation may
reveal that a supervisor does not “customarily and regularly” direct the work
of two or more employees in his or her department, despite the fact that in
particular weeks the supervisor may supervise more than one employee.  It must
always be kept in mind, however, that a change in an employee’s duties,
responsibilities, or salary (even though temporary) may bring a change in
exemption status.</p>

              <h3>22b01. Primary duty test for executive employees.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
An exempt executive employee’s primary duty must be
management of the enterprise in which employed, or management of a customarily
recognized department or subdivision of the enterprise.  “Primary duty” is
defined in 29 CFR § 541.700 as the principal, main, major or most important
duty the employee performs, determined by examining all the facts in each case
with the major emphasis on the character of the employee’s job as a whole.  The
amount of time spent performing exempt work can be a useful guide in answering
this question, but time alone is not the sole test.  The regulations do not
require that employees spend more than 50 percent of their time performing
exempt work to qualify for exemption.  Thus, while employees who spend more
than half their time performing exempt work will generally satisfy the primary
duty requirement, employees who do not spend more than half their time
performing exempt duties may still meet the primary duty requirement if other
factors support that conclusion.  Factors to consider include, but are not
limited to, the relative importance of the exempt duties compared with other
duties, the amount of time spent performing exempt work, the employee’s relative
freedom from direct supervision, and the relationship between the employee’s
salary and the wages paid to other employees for the kind of nonexempt work
performed by the employee.  For example, managers in retail establishments who
perform exempt executive duties such as supervising and directing the work of
other employees, ordering merchandise, managing the budget and authorizing
payment of bills may have management as their primary duty even if they spend
more than 50 percent of the time performing nonexempt work such as running the
cash register.  However, if a particular manager is closely supervised and
earns little more than the nonexempt employees, such a manager generally would
not satisfy the primary duty requirement.  See also FOH 22b04 and 29 CFR § 541.106.

“Customarily recognized department or subdivision” means a
recognized subpart, within the larger business unit, which has a permanent
status and continuing function.  The term is intended to distinguish between a
mere collection of employees assigned from time to time to a specific job or
series of jobs and a recognized unit with permanent status and function.  Each
separate establishment of a multi-establishment enterprise qualifies as a
recognized subdivision.  However, a recognized subdivision need not be
physically within the employer’s establishment, and may even move from place to
place.  An employee may work in more than one location without invalidating the
exemption if factors show the employee is actually in charge of a recognized
unit with a continuing function in the employer’s organization.  Continuity of
the same subordinate personnel is also not required; an otherwise exempt
employee does not lose the exemption simply because the employee obtains and
supervises workers from a pool or supervises a team of workers from other
recognized units.  Examples of  “department or subdivision” include such
groupings as a shift; a functional area, i.e. “back of the house, front of the
house” in a store or restaurant; or a small group or team of  employees who work
on a related project within a larger group.</p><p>29

<b>Primary duty during a strike period.  </b></p><p>During
a strike, otherwise exempt executive, administrative, and professional
employees often perform the work of nonexempt “rank and file” employees, which
raises a question as to their exemption status under 29 CFR part 541.  The
primary duty test does not expressly apply on a workweek basis. See 29 CFR §
541.700 and FOH 22a03.  In Marshall v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 621 F.2d
1246 (3rd Cir. 1980), which involved a three-month strike period, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that the primary duty requirement
then existing in the regulation’s “short test” for high-salaried managerial
employees could not be applied on a workweek basis (or over any specific
timeframe under the regulatory language).  Based on this ruling, WHD will, on a
nationwide basis, deem the primary duty test to be satisfied during a strike
period, provided that the otherwise exempt employee who performs nonexempt work
during that period (1) satisfied the primary duty test prior to the strike and
(2) is paid on a salary basis at a rate not less than the required weekly
amount of $455 during the strike.</p><p>Marshall

              <h3>22b02. Supervision of two or more other employees.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Whether an employee “customarily and regularly directs the
work of two or more other employees” under 29 CFR § 541.100(a)(3) depends on
all the facts. “Customarily and regularly” means greater than occasional but
may be less than constant; it includes work normally and recurrently performed
every workweek, but does not include isolated or one-time tasks.  The fact that
an occasional workweek passes when an otherwise exempt executive does not give
direct instructions to subordinate employees will not defeat the exemption,
provided the executive in fact customarily and regularly directs the
subordinate employees’ work.  In addition, in certain instances, a supervisor
(such as a district sales manager) may not work at the same time or within the
same establishment as the assigned subordinates being supervised; this will not
defeat the exemption if the criteria of 29 CFR § 541.100(a)(3) in fact are
met.  </p><p>29
CFR §§ 541.100, 541.701 </p><p>WHD
Opinion Letter FLSA 2006-35 </p><p>(b)  
“Two or more other employees” means two full-time employees
or the equivalent (29 CFR § 541.104).  For example, one full-time and two
half-time employees are equivalent to two full-time employees.  Four half-time
employees are also equivalent to two full-time employees.  Full-time generally
means someone who works 40 or more hours per week.  If occasional, temporary or
part-time employees are involved when determining if the two full-time employee
equivalency is met, an exempt executive must supervise two or more employees
for a combined total of 80 hours of work by such employees.  In other words,
the total number of hours worked by subordinate employees supervised must
ordinarily total 80 within the workweek to qualify as the equivalent of two
full-time employees. If a full-time employee works over 40 hours in the
workweek, he or she counts as the equivalent of only one employee. For example,
if a full-time employee works 60 hours per week and a part-time employee works
20 hours per week, although the two employees together work a total of 80
hours, an equivalent of only one full-time and one part-time employee is
supervised, thereby not meeting the criteria. Only other employees of the
employer may be considered when determining if the two full-time employee
equivalency is met; supervision of volunteers, employees of independent
contractors, or any other “non-employees” (trainees, interns) in relation to
the employer are not considered for purposes of this test. </p><p>29

FR 22135</p><p>WHD
Opinion Letter FLSA 2007-03  </p><p>Fact
Sheet #71</p><p>(c)  
The supervisory function can be distributed among two,
three or more exempt executives, but each executive must customarily and
regularly direct the work of two or more other full-time employees or the
equivalent.  For example, a department with five full-time nonexempt workers
may have up to two exempt supervisors if each supervisor customarily and
regularly directs the work of two full-time nonexempt workers.  However, the
hours worked by a subordinate employee may not be counted or credited more than
once for different executives. Thus, shared responsibility to supervise the
same two employees in the same department does not meet the requirement that
the executive direct the work of two or more employees or their equivalent.  On
the other hand, a full-time employee who works half of the time for one
supervisor and the other half of the time for a different supervisor may be
credited as a half-time employee for each of the supervisors.  However, if a
full-time employee usually works more than 40 hours per week and the employer
wants to “split” this employee’s time evenly between two supervisors, then each
supervisor is still supervising only one-half of this full-time employee’s
time.  Subdividing one full-time employee’s time between more than one
supervisor for purposes of this test should never add up to more than one
full-time employee</p><p>Also,
there is no requirement that the manager work at the same time or at the same
location as the subordinates in order to qualify for the exemption, as long as
the manager regularly directs the subordinate’s work.</p><p>WHD

WHD has occasionally accepted a lower full-time workweek
standard but only when unusual circumstances justified it in an industry (and
never because an individual employer’s rules defined full-time as something
less than 40 hours per week for purposes of pension or benefit plan
participation or other reasons). The exception was limited to firms in
industries that had established workweeks of 37 ½ or 35 hours for full-time
employees, such as banking and insurance in the 1970s. For example, banks
historically operated fewer hours each week compared to their normal business
operations today – i.e., they were closed to the public by mid-afternoon on
most weekdays and did not open for business on weekends (thus, the term
“banker’s hours” became known as a reference to a reduced workweek schedule
compared to the norm). Such qualifying circumstances no longer appear to be
present in the banking and insurance industries today. In the 2004 revisions to
the 541 regulations, WHD reinforced “its current interpretation that an exempt
supervisor generally must direct a total of 80 employee-hours of work each
week.” 69 FR 22135 (April 23, 2004) See also Perez v. Radioshack Corporation,
386 F. Supp. 2d 979, 990 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (to “customarily and regularly”
direct work of two or more full-time employees, an exempt executive must
supervise 80 or more hours of subordinates’ time at least 80 percent of the
time to indicate frequency greater than occasional but less than constant). </p><p>29

              <h3>22b03. Authority to hire or fire, particular weight.</h3>
              <p>To
qualify as an exempt executive, an employee must have the authority to hire or
fire other employees, or have his or her suggestions and recommendations as to
the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of
other employees be given “particular weight.”  Factors considered when
determining if an employee’s recommendations as to hiring, firing, advancement,
promotion or any other change of status are given “particular weight” include
whether it is part of the employee’s job duties to make such recommendations,
and the frequency with which such recommendations are made, requested, and
relied upon.  For example, an employee who provides few recommendations that
are never followed would not meet the requirement of 29 CFR § 541.100(a)(4). 
Generally, an executive’s recommendations must pertain to employees whom the
executive customarily and regularly directs or supervises.  It does not include
occasional suggestions regarding co-workers.  An employee’s recommendations may
still be deemed to have “particular weight” even if a higher level manager’s
recommendation has more importance and even if the employee does not have
authority to make the ultimate decision as to the employee’s change in status,
such as where a higher level manager or a personnel board makes the final
hiring, promotion or termination decision.  “Other change of status” refers to
tangible employment actions and means a significant change in employment
status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with
significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant
change in benefits.  A supervisor who provides recommendations on any one of
the specified changes in employment status may be considered to meet the
requirement of 29 CFR § 541.100(a)(4). </p><p>29

              <h3>22b04. Concurrent performance of exempt and nonexempt duties.</h3>
              <p>Concurrently
(or simultaneously) performing both exempt and nonexempt duties does not
automatically disqualify an otherwise exempt employee from the executive
exemption if all the requirements for exemption are met.  For example, if the
primary duty of a manager of a retail food service establishment is management
of that establishment, performing work such as serving customers or cooking
food during peak customer periods would not preclude exempt status.  Generally,
exempt executives make the decision regarding when to perform nonexempt duties
and remain responsible for the success or failure of business operations under their
management while performing such nonexempt tasks, and can both supervise
subordinate employees and serve customers at the same time without being
disqualified from the exemption.  In contrast, the nonexempt employee generally
is directed by a supervisor to perform the exempt work or performs the exempt
work for defined time periods.  An employee whose primary duty is ordinary
production work or routine, recurrent or repetitive tasks does not qualify for
exemption as an executive even if the employee also has some supervisory
responsibilities.  A relief supervisor or working supervisor whose primary duty
is performing nonexempt work on the production line in a manufacturing plant
does not become exempt merely because the nonexempt production line employee
occasionally has some responsibility for directing the work of other nonexempt
production line employees when, for example, the exempt supervisor is not
available.  Nonexempt employees do not become exempt executives simply because
they direct the work of other employees upon occasion or provide input on
performance issues from time to time; such employees typically would not meet
the other requirements of 29 CFR § 541.100 (such as having a primary duty of
management).  Whether an employee is exempt as an executive while performing
concurrent duties must be determined on a case-by-case basis according to the
factors set forth in 29 CFR § 541.700.  See 29 CFR § 541.703 for a discussion
of work that is “directly and closely related” to the performance of exempt
work and is, therefore, also considered exempt work, and the examples discussed
therein to illustrate types of work that are or are not considered “directly
and closely related” to exempt work.</p><p>69

An exempt administrative employee’s primary duty must be
the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management
or general business operations of the employer or of the employer’s customers.  For
further explanation of the term “primary duty” see the discussion under
“executive” at FOH 22b01.</p><p>(b)  
<b>Office or non-manual work.</b></p><p>The

manual laborers and other “blue collar” workers outside the scope of the “white
collar” exemptions. See 29 CFR § 541.3 and FOH 22a02.</p><p>(c)  
<b>Directly related to management or general business
operations.</b></p><p>The
phrase “directly related to management or general business operations” refers
to the type of work performed by the employee.  To meet this requirement, an
employee must perform work directly related to assisting with the running or
servicing of the business, as distinguished, for example, from working on a
manufacturing production line or selling a product in a retail or service
establishment.  Work “directly related to management or general business
operations” includes, but is not limited to, work in functional areas such as
tax, finance, accounting, budgeting, auditing, insurance, quality control,
purchasing, procurement, advertising, marketing, research, safety and health,
personnel management, human resources, employee benefits, labor relations,
public relations, government relations, computer network, Internet and database
administration, legal and regulatory compliance, and similar activities.  This
list is intended only to be illustrative.  It is not intended as a complete
listing of exempt areas, nor is it intended as a listing of specific jobs; rather,
it is a list of functional areas or departments that generally relate to
management and general business operations of an employer or an employer’s
customers, although each case must be examined individually.  Within such
areas, it is still necessary to analyze the level or nature of the work
performed (i.e., does the employee exercise discretion and independent judgment
as to matters of significance) in order to determine if the administrative
exemption applies.  Whether a particular employee primarily performs exempt
work depends on the actual duties performed.</p><p>The
production versus staff dichotomy is a useful analytical tool in evaluating
whether an employee’s primary duty is work directly related to management or
general business operations.  See 69 FR 22140 – 22142.  Courts have noted that
determining whether the administrative exemption applies is not as simple as a
drawing the line between “white collar” and “blue collar” employees. Rather,
non-manufacturing employees can be considered to be “production” employees if
their job is to generate the product or service that their employer’s business
offers to the public. The distinction is between those employees whose primary
duty is administering the business affairs of the enterprise from those whose
primary duty is producing the commodity or commodities, whether goods or
services, that the enterprise exists to produce and market.</p><p>(d)  
<b>Employer’s customers.</b></p><p>An
employee may qualify for the administrative exemption if the employee’s primary
duty is work directly related to the management or general business operations
of the employer’s customers, rather than those of the employer.  Thus,
employees acting as advisors or consultants to their employer’s clients or
customers – such as tax experts or financial consultants, for example - may be
exempt.  Nothing in 29 CFR part 541 precludes the administrative exemption
because the customer is an individual, rather than a business, as long as the
work performed relates to “management or general business operations.”  While
the exemption would not apply when the client’s or customer’s “business” is
purely personal, providing expert advice to a small business owner or a sole
proprietor regarding management and general business operations would be an
exempt administrative function.  For example, many bona fide administrative
employees perform important functions as advisors or consultants in analyzing
and recommending changes in business operations but are employed by an entity
engaged in furnishing such services to others for a fee (e.g., management
consultants).  Such employees, if they meet the other requirements of the
regulations, would qualify for exemption regardless of whether the management
or general business operations to which their work is directly related are
those of the employer’s clients or customers, or those of their employer.  This
provision is meant to place administratively exempt work done for a client or
customer on the same footing as such work done for the employer directly,
regardless of whether the client is a sole proprietor or a “Fortune 500”
company, as long as the work directly relates to “management or general
business operations.”</p><p>69

              <p>(a)  
To qualify for the administrative exemption, an employee’s
primary duty must include the exercise of discretion and independent judgment
with respect to matters of significance.  The exercise of discretion and
independent judgment involves the comparison and the evaluation of possible
courses of conduct and acting or making a decision after the various
possibilities have been considered.  The term must be applied in light of all
the facts of the employee’s particular employment situation, and implies that the
employee has authority to make an independent choice, free from immediate
direction or supervision.  Factors to consider include, but are not limited to
whether the employee has authority to formulate, affect, interpret, or
implement management policies or operating practices; whether the employee
carries out major assignments in conducting the operations of the business;
whether the employee performs work that affects business operations to a
substantial degree (even if the work relates to operation of only a particular
segment of the business); whether the employee has authority to commit the
employer in matters that have significant financial impact; whether the
employee has authority to waive or deviate from established policies and
procedures without prior approval; whether the employee has authority to
negotiate and bind the company on significant matters; whether the employee
provides consultation or expert advice to management; whether the employee is
involved in planning long- or short-term business objectives; whether the
employee investigates and resolves matters of significance on behalf of
management; and whether the employee represents the employer in handling
complaints, arbitrating disputes or resolving grievances.  Federal courts
generally find that employees who meet at least two or three of these factors
are exercising discretion and independent judgment, although a case-by-case
analysis is required.</p><p>69
FR 22143 through 22144</p><p>29
CFR § 541.202(a), (b), and (c) </p><p>(b)  
The fact that an employee’s decisions or recommendations
are on occasion revised or reversed after higher review does not mean that the
employee is not exercising discretion and independent judgment.  For example,
the credit policies formulated by the credit manager of a large corporation may
be subject to review by higher company officials who may approve or disapprove
these policies.  A management consultant who has studied the operations of a
business and proposed changes in organization may have the plan reviewed or
revised by superiors before it is submitted to the client.  These factors do
not detract from the fact that the work of these employees includes the
exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of
significance directly related to management or general business operations.  </p><p>29
CFR § 541.202(c) </p><p>(c)  
The exercise of discretion and independent judgment must be
more than the use of skill in applying well-established techniques, procedures
or specific standards described in manuals or other sources. Exempt employees
may use manuals, guidelines or other established procedures if they contain or
relate to highly technical, scientific, legal, financial or other similarly
complex matters that can be understood or interpreted only by those with
advanced or specialized knowledge or skills.  Employees who simply apply
well-established techniques or procedures within closely prescribed limits,
however, are not exempt.  The exercise of discretion and independent judgment
also does not include clerical or secretarial work; recording or tabulating
data; or performing other mechanical, repetitive, recurrent or routine work. 
An employee who simply tabulates data is not exempt even if labeled a
“statistician.” </p><p>29
CFR §§ 541.202(e), 541.704 </p><p>(d)  
The term “matters of significance” refers to the level of
importance or consequence of the work performed to the management or general
business operations of the employer or of the employer’s customers.  An
employee does not exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to
matters of significance merely because the employer will experience financial
losses if the employee fails to perform the job properly.  A messenger, for
example, who is entrusted with carrying large sums of money does not exercise
discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance
even though serious consequences may result from the employee’s neglect. 
Similarly, an employee who operates very expensive equipment does not exercise
discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance
merely because improper performance of the employee’s duties may cause serious
financial loss to the employer.  </p><p>29

              <h3>22d02.             Primary duty test for “learned” professional employees.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
An exempt “learned” professional employee’s primary duty
must be the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of
science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized
intellectual instruction (29 CFR § 541.301(a)).  For further explanation of the
term “primary duty,”see the discussion under “executive” at FOH 22b01.</p><p>29
CFR § 541.301(a) </p><p>(b)  
“Work requiring advanced knowledge” means work which is
predominantly intellectual in character, and which includes work requiring the
consistent exercise of discretion and judgment.  Learned professional work is
therefore distinguished from work involving routine mental, manual, mechanical
or physical work.  A learned professional employee generally uses the advanced
knowledge to analyze, interpret or make deductions from varying facts or
circumstances.  Advanced knowledge cannot be attained at the high school
level.  </p><p>29
CFR § 541.301(b)</p><p>(c)  
“Field(s) of science or learning” include law, medicine,
theology, accounting, actuarial computation, engineering, architecture,
teaching, various types of physical, chemical and biological sciences, pharmacy
and other similar occupations that have a recognized professional status and
can be distinguished from the mechanical arts or skilled trades where the
knowledge could be of a fairly advanced type, but is not in a field of science
or learning. </p><p>29
CFR § 541.301(c) </p><p>(d)  
The phrase “customarily acquired by a prolonged course of
specialized intellectual instruction” restricts the learned professional
exemption to professions where specialized academic training is a standard
prerequisite for entrance into the profession.  The best evidence of meeting
this requirement is having the appropriate academic degree for the particular
profession.  However, the word “customarily” means the exemption is available
to employees in such professions who have substantially the same knowledge
level and perform substantially the same work as the degreed employees, but who
attained the advanced knowledge through a combination of work experience and
intellectual instruction.  Thus, for example, the learned professional
exemption is available to the occasional lawyer who has not gone to law school,
or the occasional chemist who does not possess a degree in chemistry.  However,
the learned professional exemption is not available for occupations that
require only a four-year degree in any field or a two-year degree as a
prerequisite for entrance into the field. The learned professional exemption is
not available for occupations that customarily may be performed with knowledge
acquired through an apprenticeship, or with training in the performance of routine
mental, manual, mechanical or physical processes.  The learned professional
exemption also does not apply to occupations in which most employees acquire
their skill by experience rather than by advanced specialized intellectual
instruction.  </p><p>29
CFR § 541.301(d) </p><p>69
FR 22150</p><p>WHD
Letter FLSA 2005-35NA </p><p>Accredited
curriculums and certification programs are relevant to determining exempt
learned professional status only to the extent they provide evidence that a
prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction has become a standard
prerequisite for entrance into the profession.  Neither the identity of the
certifying organization nor the mere fact that certification is required is
determinative if certification does not involve a prolonged course of
specialized intellectual instruction.  For example, certified physicians
assistants meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption
because certification requires four years of specialized post-secondary school
instruction; employees with cosmetology licenses are not exempt as learned
professionals because the licenses do not require a prolonged course of
specialized intellectual instruction.  In addition, the fact that an employee
possesses a license to practice a certain profession must be considered along
with all the other criteria in determining the exempt status of the employee. 
The possession of a license permitting an employee to perform duties which
would meet the tests of an exempt employee under 29 CFR part 541 does not make
that employee necessarily exempt.  In order for an employee to meet the duties
tests under 29 CFR part 541, the employee must actually perform exempt duties. 
</p><p>69
FR 22157</p><p>(e)  
The areas in which the professional exemption may be
available are expanding.  As knowledge is developed, academic training is
broadened and specialized degrees are offered in new and diverse fields, thus
creating new specialists in particular fields of science or learning.  When an
advanced specialized degree has become a standard requirement for  entrance
into a particular occupation, that occupation may have acquired the
characteristics of a learned profession.  Accrediting and certifying
organizations similar to those listed in 29 CFR § 541.301(e)(1), (e)(3),
(e)(4), (e)(8) and (e)(9) also may be created in the future.  Such
organizations may develop similar specialized curriculums and certification
programs which, if a standard requirement for a particular occupation, may
indicate that the occupation has acquired the characteristics of a learned
profession.  </p>

              <p>(a)  
An exempt “creative” professional employee’s primary duty
must be the performance of work requiring invention, imagination, originality,
or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor, as opposed to
routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work.  This requirement
distinguishes the creative professions from work that primarily depends on
intelligence, diligence and accuracy.  </p><p>(b)  
Exemption as a creative professional depends upon how much
invention, imagination, originality or talent the employee exercises.  Whether
the exemption applies, therefore, is determined on a case-by-case basis.  The
requirements are generally met by actors, musicians, composers, conductors, and
soloists; painters who are given at most the subject matter of their painting;
cartoonists who are told only the title or underlying concept for a cartoon and
must rely on their own creative ability to express the concept; essayists,
novelists, short story writers and screenplay writers who choose their own
subjects and submit completed works to their employers; and persons in the more
responsible writing positions in advertising agencies.  Someone employed as a
copyist, as an animator of motion picture cartoons, or as a re-toucher of
photographs would not meet the requirements since such work is not properly
described as creative in character.  Journalists may satisfy the duties
requirements for the creative professional exemption if their primary duty is
work requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent, as opposed to
work that depends primarily on intelligence, diligence and accuracy. 
Journalists are not exempt creative professionals if they only collect,
organize and record information that is routine or already public, or if they do
not contribute a unique interpretation or analysis to a news product. Reporters
who merely re-write press releases or who write standard recounts of public
information by gathering facts on routine community events are not exempt
creative professionals. Reporters whose work products are subject to
substantial control by their employer also do not qualify as exempt creative
professionals.  See also FOH 22i25.</p><p>29

academic teachers; teachers of kindergarten or nursery school pupils; teachers
of gifted or disabled children; teachers of skilled and semiskilled trades and
occupations; teachers engaged in automobile driving instruction; aircraft
flight instructors; home economics teachers; and vocal or instrumental music
instructors.  Faculty members engaged as teachers who also spend a considerable
amount of their time in extracurricular activities such as coaching athletic
teams or acting as moderators or advisors in such areas as drama, speech, debate
or journalism are engaged in teaching.  Such extracurricular activities are a
recognized part of the schools’ responsibility in contributing to the
educational development of the student.</p><p>29
CFR § 541.303(b) </p><p>(d)  
Possession of an elementary or secondary teacher’s
certificate identifies the individuals who are considered within the scope of
the exemption for teaching professionals.  Teachers who possess a teaching
certificate qualify for the exemption regardless of the terminology (e.g.,
permanent, conditional, standard, provisional, temporary, emergency, or
unlimited) used by the State to refer to different kinds of certificates. 
However, private schools and public schools are not uniform in requiring a
certificate for employment as an elementary or secondary school teacher, and a
teacher’s certificate is not generally necessary for employment in institutions
of higher education or other educational establishments.  Therefore, a teacher
who is not certified may be considered for exemption, provided that such
individual is employed as a teacher by the employing school or school system.</p><p>29

“The term ‘educational establishment’ means an elementary
or secondary school system, an institution of higher education or other
educational institution.  Sections 3(v) and 3(w) of the Act define elementary
and secondary schools as those day or residential schools that provide
elementary or secondary education, as determined under State law.  Under the
laws of most States, such education includes the curriculums in grades 1
through 12. Under many it includes also the introductory programs in
kindergarten, and some States may also include nursery school programs in
elementary education and junior college curriculums in secondary education.  The
term ‘other educational establishment’ includes special schools for mentally or
physically disabled or gifted children, regardless of any classification of
such schools as elementary, secondary or higher.  Factors relevant in
determining whether post-secondary career programs qualify as educational
institutions include whether the school is licensed by a state agency
responsible for the state’s educational system or accredited by a nationally
recognized accrediting organization for career schools.  Also, for purposes of
the exemption, no distinction is drawn between public and private schools, or
between those operated for profit and those that are not for profit.”</p><p>29

              <p>The
revised final regulations effective August 23, 2004, made no changes in the
Division’s interpretation of the law regarding the exempt status of bona fide
teachers in qualifying educational establishments.  The activity of imparting
knowledge through teaching, tutoring, instructing or lecturing implies a type
of work which is predominantly intellectual and which includes the exercise of
discretion and judgment in providing instruction to pupils.  See WHD Fact Sheet
17D.  Although preschools and day care centers (particularly at the earliest
ages of preparing children to enter school) may engage in some educational
activities, employees whose primary duty is to provide custodial care for the
basic physical needs of the children attending (as opposed to being engaged in
the intellectual activities of teaching, tutoring, instructing or lecturing in
order to impart knowledge) do not ordinarily meet the primary duty test for
exemption as teachers.  Conversely, bona fide teachers in preschool and
kindergarten settings may qualify for exemption under the same conditions as a
teacher in an elementary or secondary school, i.e., if they meet the primary
duty test for a teacher and are employed and engaged in this activity as a
teacher in a qualifying “educational establishment.”  Daycare centers providing
custodial care and protection of preschool age children before they are old
enough to enter the kindergarten or nursery school programs established for the
particular State’s elementary school curriculum do not qualify as “educational
establishments” for purposes of the teacher exemption.</p><p>29

A substitute teacher may qualify for the professional
exemption if the duties test is met. </p><p>Certain
states do not require substitute teachers to have a college degree or teaching
certificate. </p><p>Instead,
a state, for example, may indicate that a person wishing to work as a

a substitute teaching permit, having completed a requisite number of college
semester hours, or having obtained an associate's degree from a regionally or
nationally accredited institution; or having obtained a high school diploma or
G.E.D. certificate, and completing 24 hours of in-service training and ten
hours of classroom observation. </p><p>Substitute
teachers qualify for the professional exemption if their primary duty is
teaching and imparting knowledge in an educational establishment. On the other
hand, substitute teachers whose primary duties are not related to teaching—for
example, performing general clerical or administrative tasks for the school
unrelated to teaching their assigned students, or manual labor—do not qualify
for the professional exemption. The term &quot;educational establishment&quot;
includes &quot;an elementary or secondary school system, an institution of
higher education or other educational institution.&quot; </p><p>A

exemption. However, private schools and public schools are not uniform in

Therefore, a teacher who is not certified may be considered for exemption,
provided that such individual is employed as a teacher by the employing school
or school system. Further, there is no minimum educational or academic degree
requirement for bona fide teaching professionals in educational institutions.
Employees working as substitute teachers are within the teaching professional
exemption whether or not they possess an advanced academic degree so long as
teaching is their primary duty. </p><p>WHD

              <h3>22e00. Statutory basis for exemption of computer-related occupations.</h3>
              <p>Public
Law 101-583 (Nov. 15, 1990), directed DOL to issue regulations permitting
computer systems analysts, computer programmers, software engineers, and other
similarly-skilled professional workers to qualify as exempt executive,
administrative, or professional employees under 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1); the law
also exempted employees in the named occupations if they were paid on an hourly
basis at a rate of at least 6 ½ times the minimum wage.  These statutory
provisions were incorporated into former 29 CFR §§ 541.3(a)(4) and 541.303, as
part of the “professional” employee exemption, in 1992.  When Congress
increased the minimum wage in 1996, Congress adopted most – but not all – of
the Department’s regulatory language constituting the computer employee
“primary duty test” as a separate statutory exemption in a new 29 U.S.C. §  213(a)(17). 
29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(17) exempts “any employee who is a computer systems analyst,
computer programmer, software engineer, or other similarly skilled worker,
whose primary duty …” meets one of three specified sets of duties, or a
combination of the specified duties requiring the same level of skills.  The
1996 amendment also froze the hourly compensation test at $27.63 (which equaled
6 ½ times the former $4.25 minimum wage).  The 1996 law included no delegation
of rulemaking authority to DOL to further interpret or define the scope of the
exemption; however, it also did not repeal the original 1990 statute. The 2004 part
541 final rule aligned the duties test in the regulatory text with the 1996
law. Thus the same duties test now applies for determining the exempt status of
computer-related occupations under either 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) or 29 U.S.C.
§ 213(a)(17), but an exempt computer employee may be paid either “on a salary
basis” at a rate not less than $455 per week, or on an hourly basis at a rate
not less than $27.63 per hour.</p><p>69

              <p>(a)  
To be exempt as a bona fide “outside sales” employee under 29
CFR § 541.500, all of the following tests must be met:</p><p>(1)  The employee’s
primary duty must be making sales (as defined in 29 U.S.C. § 203(k)), or
obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities for
which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer, and </p><p>(2)  The employee

“Primary duty” is defined in 29 CFR § 541.700 as the
principal, main, major or most important duty that the employee performs. 
Determination of an employee’s primary duty must be based on all the facts in
each case with the major emphasis on the character of the employee’s job as a
whole.  In determining the primary duty of an outside sales employee, work
performed incidental to and in conjunction with the employee’s own outside
sales or solicitations, including incidental deliveries and collections, is
considered exempt outside sales work.  Other work that furthers the employee’s
own sales efforts is also considered exempt work, e.g., writing sales reports,
updating or revising the employee’s sales or display catalogue, planning
itineraries and attending sales conferences.  (29 CFR § 541.500(b))  For
further explanation of the term “primary duty” see the discussion under

              <h3>22f06.  Real estate sales.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
29 CFR § 541.500 requires that an outside sales employee’s
primary duty must be making “sales” within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 203(k) or
in obtaining certain orders or contracts for the use of facilities. Real estate
sales employees will generally meet this test, since “sales” under 29 U.S.C.
§ 203(k) includes contracts to sell.</p><p>(b)  
An exempt outside sales employee also must be customarily
and regularly engaged “away from the employer’s place or places of business” in
making such sales.  Real estate sales employees typically are required, as a
customary and regular part of their employment, to spend time as necessary at the
site of property to be sold and in visiting prospects at the latter’s homes and
offices as a part of their sales effort.  Most of them must leave whatever
place of business of the employer they use as headquarters in order to perform
these tasks.</p><p>(c)  
A real estate sales employee stationed in a model home on a
tract from which parcels of real property are being sold with or without
improvements, leaving the model home for such purposes, customarily and
regularly, would meet the requirement of the definition, so far as making sales
“away from” the employer’s place of business is concerned.  This is true even
though all of the property shown to prospects by the sales employee is within
the tract on which the model home is located.  Further, not every home called a
“model home” would be a place of business of the employer.  One which is in the
nature of an “open house” to which a sales employee is assigned to meet
prospects who may buy that house or another similar one on the tract may more
properly be viewed as analogous to the hotel sample room of a traveling sales
employee referred to in 29 CFR § 541.502 than to an actual place of business of
the employer.  Moreover, time spent on return to the model home or other
headquarters to conclude a sales transaction or to continue the sales effort
with the prospect would be deemed part of the sales employee’s outside sales
activity.</p><p>WHD

Certain activities performed by real estate sales employees

example, the employees may perform duties at their employer’s place of business

<b>Timeshare resort salespeople.</b></p><p>Employees
whose primary duty is to promote and to sell timeshare interests in resorts
owned or operated by their employers do not qualify for the outside sales
exemption when they sell timeshares on site at the resorts because they are not
engaged in sales away from their employer’s place of business. Sales conducted
at an office away from the resort that is a place of business of their employer
would also not qualify as sales made away from the employer’s place of
business. These employees may meet the tests of the outside sales exemption if
they customarily and regularly make sales at a location that is not the
employer’s place of business.   </p><p>The
question with timeshare salespeople is whether they are customarily and
regularly engaged away from the employer’s place of business in performing
their primary duty of making sales.  A resort is generally maintained on a
permanent basis as a location of the employer and is staffed with the necessary
personnel for maintaining the resort facilities.  Although the employer
sells timeshare interests in some of the properties on the resort, the employer
also retains a continuing business interest in the remaining resort facilities,
and in maintaining both the resort and the timeshare units that have been
sold.  Under these facts, the entire resort must be considered the
employer’s place of business.  </p><p>Timeshare
salespeople differ from real estate sales employees selling lots of land from a
model home on a subdivision, who customarily and regularly leave the model
home, because in the latter situation the employer does not maintain a
continuing interest in the subdivision lots once they are sold or in the other
facilities in the subdivision, and thus these areas are not part of the
employer’s place of business.  </p><p>If

              <p>(a)  
To qualify as a bona fide exempt executive, administrative
or professional employee, the  employee must be compensated on a salary basis
at a rate of not less than $455/wk (or $380/wk, if employed in American Samoa
by employers other than the Federal government), exclusive of board, lodging or
other facilities. Administrative, professional and computer employees may also
be paid on a fee basis, as defined in 29 CFR § 541.605.  The minimum weekly
salary specified in each category of the 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) exemptions is
one of several tests applied to determine if the exemptions are applicable; it
is not a minimum wage requirement.  No employer is required to pay an employee
the salary specified in 29 CFR part 541 unless the employer is claiming an
exemption pursuant to 29 CFR part 541 and 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1).</p><p>29
CFR § 541.600(a) </p><p>(b)  
The $455 required weekly minimum salary may be translated
into equivalent amounts for periods longer than one week.  The requirement will
be met if the employee is compensated biweekly on a salary basis of $910,
semimonthly on a salary basis of $985.83, or monthly on a salary basis of
$1,971.66.  However, the shortest period of payment that will meet this
compensation requirement is one week.</p><p>29
CFR § 541.600(b) </p><p>(c)  
For academic administrative employees, the compensation
requirement also may be met by compensation on a salary basis at a rate at
least equal to the entrance salary for teachers in the educational
establishment by which the employee is employed, as stated in 29 CFR § 541.204(a)(1).</p><p>29
CFR § 541.600(c) </p><p>(d)  
For computer-related occupations exempt under 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(17),
the compensation requirement also may be met by payment on an hourly basis at
not less than $27.63/hour, as stated in 29 CFR § 541.400(b).          </p><p>29
CFR § 541.600(d) </p><p>(e)  
For professional employees, the compensation requirements
do not apply to employees engaged as teachers, see 29 CFR § 541.303; employees
who hold a valid license or certificate permitting the practice of law or
medicine or any of their branches and are actually engaged in the practice
thereof, see 29 CFR § 541.304; or to employees who hold the requisite academic
degree for the general practice of medicine and are engaged in an internship or
resident program pursuant to the practice of the profession. See 29 CFR §
541.304.  The exception from the salary or fee requirement for medical

              <h3>22g01. Highly compensated
employees test.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Under 29 CFR § 541.601, an employee who receives total
annual compensation of at least $100,000 is considered exempt if the employee
“customarily and regularly” performs any one or more of the exempt duties or
responsibilities of an executive, administrative or professional employee
identified in 29 CFR part 541 subparts B, C or D.  “Customarily and regularly”
means greater than occasional but may be less than constant, and includes work
normally and recurrently performed every workweek but does not include isolated
or one-time tasks.  </p><p>29
CFR §§ 541.601, 541.707 </p><p>(b)  
 </p><p>(1)  “Total annual
compensation” must include at least $455/wk paid on a salary or fee basis. See 29
CFR §§ 541.602, 541.605.  Thus, highly compensated employees must receive at
least the same base salary throughout the year as required for exempt employees
under the standard exemption tests, while allowing highly compensated employees
to receive additional income in the form of commissions and nondiscretionary
bonuses.  Total annual compensation may include commissions, nondiscretionary
bonuses and other nondiscretionary compensation earned during a 52-week
period.  Total annual compensation does not include board, lodging and other
facilities as defined in 29 CFR § 541.606, and does not include payments for
medical insurance, payments for life insurance, contributions to retirement
plans and the cost of other fringe benefits.</p><p>29 CFR § 541.
601(b)(1) </p><p>(2)  Whether bonuses
or other forms of compensation are discretionary or nondiscretionary is
determined by applying the principles in the Act and regulations defining
discretionary bonuses in 29 U.S.C. § 207(e)(3)(a) and 29 CFR § 778.211.  (Under
these principles, discretionary bonuses are excluded from an employee’s regular
rate of pay; nondiscretionary bonuses must be included in the regular rate. 
Similarly, under the highly compensated employee test, all nondiscretionary
bonuses and any other form of nondiscretionary compensation earned during the
year are counted, together with the employee’s salary, towards the $100,000
threshold.)  If the employer retains the discretion as to both the fact that a
payment will be made and the amount of the payment until at or near the point
in time that the payment is to be made, the payment is discretionary;
otherwise, it is nondiscretionary.  If an employer promises in advance to pay a
bonus, it is nondiscretionary.  If, under the terms of an employment agreement,
an employee has a contract right, express or implied, to receive a particular
type of payment, it is nondiscretionary.  </p><p>The following types
of payments are considered nondiscretionary: </p><p>a.    
Payments made pursuant to any prior contract, agreement, or
promise causing the employee to expect such payments regularly (e.g.,
commissions or bonuses paid monthly or quarterly based on the amount of sales
or profits),</p><p>b.    
Bonuses that are promised to employees upon hiring,</p><p>c.    
Bonuses that result from collective bargaining,</p><p>d.    
Bonuses that are announced ahead of time to induce
employees to complete assignments more quickly, more efficiently, or more
cost-effectively; (such as attendance bonuses, individual or group production
bonuses, or bonuses for quality and accuracy of work),</p><p>e.    
Bonuses that are made contingent upon the employee
remaining employed with the employer until the time the payment is to be made.</p><p>All forms of
nondiscretionary compensation are included when determining if a highly
compensated employee has received not less than $100,000 in total annual
compensation.</p><p>(3)  If an
employee’s total annual compensation does not total at least $100,000 by the
final pay period of the 52-week period, the employer may, during the last pay
period or within one month after the end of the 52-week period, make one final payment
sufficient to achieve the $100,000 compensation level.  Any such final payment
made after the end of the 52-week period may count only toward the prior year’s
total annual compensation and not toward the total annual compensation in the
year it was paid.  If the employer fails to make such a payment, the employee
does not qualify as a highly compensated employee, but may be tested for
exemption under the standard exemption tests in 29 CFR part 541 subparts B, C
or D.</p><p>29 CFR §
541.601(b)(2) </p><p>(4)  An employee who
does not work a full year for the employer, either because the employee is
newly hired after the beginning of the year or ends the employment before the
end of the year, may qualify for exemption as a highly compensated employee if
the employee receives a pro rata portion of the minimum $100,000 annual amount,
based upon the number of weeks that the employee will be or has been employed. 
An employer may make one final payment as under 22g01(b)(3) within one month
after the end of the employee’s employment.</p><p>29 CFR §
541.601(b)(3) </p><p>(5)  The employer
may utilize any 52-week period as the compensation year, such as a calendar
year, a fiscal year, or an anniversary of hire year.  If the employer does not
identify some other year period in advance, the calendar year will be applied.</p><p>29 CFR §
541.601(b)(4)</p><p>(c)  
A high level of compensation is a strong indicator of a
“white collar” employee’s exempt status, thus eliminating the need for a
detailed analysis of the employee’s particular job duties.  A highly
compensated employee will qualify for exemption if the employee customarily and
regularly performs any one or more of the exempt duties or responsibilities of
an executive, administrative or professional employee identified in 29 CFR part
541 subparts B, C or D.  For example, an employee may qualify as a highly compensated
executive employee if the employee customarily and regularly directs the work
of two or more other employees, even though the employee does not meet all of
the other requirements for the executive exemption under 29 CFR § 541.100.  </p><p>29
CFR § 541.601(c) </p><p>69
FR 22173 through 22174</p><p>(d)  
The highly compensated employee exemption applies only to
employees whose primary duty includes performing office or non-manual work. 
Thus, for example, non-management production-line workers and non-management
employees in maintenance, construction and similar occupations such as
carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen,
operating engineers, longshoremen, construction workers, laborers and other
employees who perform work involving repetitive operations with their hands,
physical skill and energy cannot qualify for exemption under this test no
matter how highly paid they might be.  </p><p>29

              <h3>22g02. “Salary basis” rule.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
To qualify for exemption under 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1), employees
generally must be paid not less than $455/wk “on a salary basis.”  However,
these salary requirements do not apply to outside sales employees (29 CFR
§ 541.500(c)), teachers (29 CFR § 541.303(d)), or employees practicing law
or medicine (29 CFR § 541.304).  Exempt computer employees may be paid either
on a salary or fee basis at not less than $455/wk or on an hourly basis at not
less than $27.63/hour (29 CFR § 541.400(b)).</p><p>(b)  
Being paid “on a salary basis” means that the employee
regularly receives a predetermined amount of compensation each pay period on a
weekly, or less frequent, basis and the predetermined amount cannot be subject
to reduction because of variations in either the quality or the quantity of
work performed by the employee.  Except for seven exceptions specifically cited
in the regulations (29 CFR § 541.602(b)(1) through (7)), an exempt employee
must receive the full salary for any week in which the employee performs any
work, regardless of the number of days or hours worked.  If the employer makes
deductions from the employee’s predetermined salary because of the operating
requirements of the business or absences caused by the employer, the employee
is not paid “on a salary basis.”  If an exempt employee is ready, willing and
able to work, deductions may not be made for time when work is not available. 
However, exempt employees need not be paid for any workweek in which they
perform no work.</p><p>29
CFR § 541.602(a) </p><p>WHD
Opinion Letter FLSA 2005-01 </p><p>(c)  
The regulations contain seven exceptions to the salary
basis “no pay-docking” rule (29 CFR § 541.602(b)(1) - (7)). Employers may
make deductions from the salaries of exempt employees in the following
circumstances:</p><p>(1)  When the
employee is absent from work for one or more full days for personal reasons,
other than sickness or disability – if an exempt employee is absent for one and
a half days for personal reasons, the employer may deduct only for the one
full-day absence; </p><p>29 CFR §
541.602(b)(1)</p><p>(2)  When the
employee is absent from work for one or more full days due to sickness or
disability (including work-related accidents) if the deduction is made
according to a bona fide plan, policy or practice of providing compensation for
loss of salary for these types of absences, including under a State disability
insurance law or State workers’ compensation law (the employer is not required
to pay any portion of the employee’s salary for full-day absences for which the
employee receives compensation under the plan, policy, or practice, or for full-day
absences before the employee has qualified under the plan, policy or practice
and after the employee has exhausted the leave allowance thereunder);</p><p>29 CFR §
541.602(b)(2) </p><p>(3)  While an
employer cannot make deductions from an exempt employee’s salary for absences
caused by jury duty, attendance as a witness or temporary military leave, the
employer may offset any amounts received by an employee as jury fees, witness
fees or military pay for a particular week against the salary due for that
particular week; </p><p>29 CFR § 541.602(b)(3)
</p><p>(4)  For penalties
imposed in good faith for infractions of safety rules of “major significance”
including those related to preventing serious danger in the workplace or to
employees, such as “no smoking” rules in explosive plants, oil refineries and
coal mines;</p><p>29 CFR §
541.602(b)(4) </p><p>(5)  For unpaid
disciplinary suspensions of one or more full days imposed in good faith
pursuant to a written policy applicable to all employees for infractions of
workplace misconduct rules (e.g., written policies prohibiting sexual
harassment, violence in the workplace, drug or alcohol violations, or
violations of state or federal laws -  i.e. serious workplace misconduct issues,
not performance or attendance issues); </p><p>29 CFR §
541.602(b)(5) </p><p>(6)  An employer may
pay a proportionate part of an exempt employee’s salary for the time actually
worked in the initial and final weeks of employment (but employees are not paid
on a salary basis if they are employed occasionally for a few days at a time
and the employer pays them a proportionate part of the weekly salary when so
employed); and</p><p>29 CFR §
541.602(b)(6) </p><p>(7)  When an
employee takes unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, the
employer may pay a proportionate part of the full salary for time actually

</b><b>Full-day vs. partial-day deductions.</b></p><p>Certain
deductions permitted under the regulations may be taken only for “one or more full

weeks of employment (29 CFR § 541.602(b)(6)) or for unpaid leave taken
under the Family and Medical Leave Act (29 CFR §541.602(b)(7)).  Thus, for
example, if an employee is absent for one and a half days to handle personal
affairs, the employer may only deduct for the one full-day absence.  The
employee must receive a full day’s pay for the partial day worked to satisfy
the “salary basis” rule.  A deduction from pay as a penalty for violations of
major safety rules under 29 CFR § 541.602(b)(4) may be made in any amount.</p><p>29

record their hours worked; requiring exempt employees to work a specified
schedule of hours; and implementing bona fide, across-the-board changes in
schedules.</p><p>69 FR 22178 through

has adopted a vacation leave and sick leave policy or plan, or a plan providing
employees leave to attend children’s school activities, or to transport family
members to routine medical appointments, it is permissible for the employer to
substitute or reduce the accrued leave in the plan for the time that an exempt
salaried employee is absent from work even if it is less than a full day
without affecting the salary basis of payment, if by substituting or reducing
such “leave bank” the employee continues to receive payment of an amount equal
to the employee’s guaranteed salary.  However, if an exempt employee is absent
for less than a full day, the employee must still receive payment of the full
guaranteed salary even if the employee has no accrued benefits in the “leave
bank” or if the employee’s account has a negative balance.  According to
§ 541.602(b)(1), the employer may deduct from the salary of an exempt
employee for being absent a full day for personal reasons. The employee’s
exempt status, however, would not be affected if the employer chooses to pay a
portion of the daily equivalent salary when the employee has insufficient leave
available to cover the full-day absence (e.g., an employer applies the last
remaining four hours of leave in an employee’s “leave bank” which only
partially covers the full-day, eight-hour absence).</p><p>WHD Opinion Letter FLSA

              <h3>22g03. Effect of improper deductions from salary.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
An employer will lose the exemption if the facts
demonstrate that the employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary
basis.  An “actual practice” of making improper deductions demonstrates that
the employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary basis.  The factors to
consider when determining whether an employer has an actual practice of making
improper deductions include, but are not limited to, the number of improper
deductions, particularly as compared to the number of employee infractions
warranting discipline; the time period during which the employer made improper
deductions; the number and geographic location of employees whose salary was
improperly reduced; the number and geographic location of managers responsible
for taking the improper deductions; and whether the employer has a clearly
communicated policy permitting or prohibiting improper deductions. </p><p>29
CFR § 541.603(a) </p><p>(b)  
If the facts demonstrate that the employer has an actual
practice of making improper deductions, the exemption is lost during the time
period in which the improper deductions were made for employees in the same job
classification working for the same managers responsible for the actual
improper deductions.  Employees in different job classifications or who work
for different managers do not lose their exempt status.  For example, if a
manager at a company facility routinely docks the pay of engineers at that
facility for partial-day personal absences, then all engineers at that facility
whose pay could have been improperly docked by that manager would lose the
exemption; engineers at other facilities or working for other managers,
however, would remain exempt.  </p><p>29
CFR § 541.603(b) </p><p>(c)  
Isolated or inadvertent improper deductions will not result
in loss of the exemption for any employees if the employer reimburses the
employees for the improper deductions.  Whether deductions are “isolated” is
determined according to an analysis of the factors in 29 CFR § 541.603(a). 
“Inadvertent” deductions are those taken unintentionally, for example, as a
result of a clerical or time-keeping error.</p><p>29
CFR § 541.603(c) </p><p>69
FR 22181</p><p>(d)  
<b>Safe harbor.</b></p><p>(1)  29 CFR § 541.603(d)
provides a safe harbor for employers that have a clearly communicated policy
prohibiting improper deductions.  If an employer has such a clearly
communicated policy that prohibits the improper pay deductions specified in 29 CFR
§ 541.602(a), includes a mechanism for employees to file complaints, reimburses
employees for any improper deductions and makes a good faith commitment to
comply with the salary basis rule in the future, the employer will not lose the
exemption for any employees unless the employer willfully violates the policy
by continuing to make improper deductions after receiving employee complaints. 
Failure to reimburse employees for any improper deductions or continuing to
make improper deductions after receiving employee complaints will cause the
exemption to be lost during the time period in which the improper deductions
were made for employees in the same job classification working for the same
managers responsible for the actual improper deductions.</p><p>(2)  Although a
written policy is the best evidence of the employer’s good faith efforts to
comply with the salary basis rule under 29 CFR part 541, a written policy is
not essential.  However, the policy must have been “clearly communicated” to
employees prior to the actual impermissible deduction.  The “clearly
communicated” standard can be met, for example, by providing a copy of the
policy to employees when they are hired, publishing it in an employee handbook
or distributing it to employees over the employer’s Intranet.</p><p>(3)  The safe harbor
provision is available regardless of the reason for the improper deduction,
whether made for lack of work or for reasons other than lack of work.  For
example, where an employer has a clearly communicated policy prohibiting
improper deductions but a manager engages in an actual practice (neither
isolated nor inadvertent) of making improper deductions, regardless of the
reasons for the deductions, the exemption would not be lost for any employees
if, after receiving and investigating an employee complaint, the employer
reimburses the employees for the improper deductions and makes a good faith
commitment to comply in the future.  There are several ways in which an
employer could show its “good faith commitment” to comply in the future
including (but not limited to) adopting or re-publishing to employees its
policy prohibiting improper pay deductions; posting a notice including such a
commitment on an employee bulletin board or the employer’s Intranet; providing
training to managers and supervisors on the employer’s policy and commitment;
reprimanding or training the manager who took the improper deduction(s); or
establishing a telephone number for employees to file complaints concerning
improper deductions.</p><p>69 FR 22181 through 22182</p><p>(4)  An employer
should be allowed a reasonable amount of time to look into and correct a matter
after receiving an employee complaint of improper deductions.  While the amount
of time it will take an employer to complete an investigation will depend upon
the particular circumstances, an employer should begin such an investigation
promptly.  However, the mere fact that the employer receives other employee complaints
before timely completion of the investigation should not, by itself, defeat the
safe harbor. </p><p>69 FR 22183</p>

(An exempt employee may receive additional compensation
beyond the minimum required amount that is paid as a guaranteed salary without
violating the salary basis requirement.  29 CFR § 541.604(a).  Thus, for
example, an exempt employee guaranteed at least $455 each week paid on a salary
basis may also receive additional compensation of a one percent commission on
sales.  An exempt employee also may receive a percentage of the sales or profits
if the employment arrangement also includes a guarantee of at least $455 each
week paid on a salary basis.  Similarly, the exemption is not lost if an exempt
employee who is guaranteed at least $455 each week paid on a salary basis also
receives additional compensation based on hours worked for work beyond the
normal workweek.  Such additional compensation may be paid on any basis (e.g.,
flat sum, bonus payment, straight-time hourly amount, time and one-half or any
other basis), and may include paid time off.</p><p>WHD

The prohibition against improper deductions from the

additional compensation provided to exempt employees. Therefore, deductions for
cash shortages, for example, may be made from a salaried exempt employee’s
commission payments without affecting the employee’s exempt status under

              <h3>22g06. Computation of salary on an hourly, daily or shift basis.</h3>
              <p>An
exempt employee’s earnings may be computed on an hourly, daily, or shift basis,
without losing the exemption or violating the salary basis requirement, if the
employment arrangement also includes a guarantee of at least the minimum weekly
required amount paid on a salary basis regardless of the number of hours, days,
or shifts worked; and a reasonable relationship exists between the guaranteed
amount and the amount actually earned.  The reasonable relationship test will
be met if the weekly guarantee is roughly equivalent to the employee’s usual
earnings at the assigned hourly, daily, or shift rate for the employee’s normal
scheduled workweek, as the case may be.  Thus, for example, an exempt employee
guaranteed compensation of at least $500 for any week in which the employee
performs any work, and who normally works four or five shifts each week, may be
paid $150 per shift without violating the salary basis requirement (such an
employee must receive the full $500 guarantee in any week in which he or she
works three or fewer shifts). The reasonable relationship requirement applies
only to situations where the employee’s pay is computed on an hourly, daily or
shift basis.  It does not apply, for example, to an exempt store manager paid a
guaranteed salary of $650 per week who also receives a commission of one-half
percent of all sales in the store or five percent of the store’s profits, which
in some weeks may total as much as, or even more than, the guaranteed salary. 
The actual facts under the employment arrangement must be scrutinized in each
instance to determine the predetermined amount that was actually guaranteed to
be paid “on a salary basis.”</p><p>29

              <p>To
qualify as a guaranteed salary, payment of a fixed, predetermined amount “free
and clear” (at a rate not less than $455 per week) is required for each
workweek in which an exempt employee performs any work. Bonuses and commissions
do not generally qualify as fixed, predetermined amounts that are paid “free
and clear” because they are normally subject to variations based on the quality
or quantity of the work performed.</p><p>29

              <h3>22g08. Fee basis.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Administrative, professional, and computer employees may be
paid on a fee basis, rather than on a salary basis.  An employee is considered
paid on a “fee basis” under 29 CFR § 541.605 if the employee is paid an agreed
sum for completing a single job, regardless of the time required to complete
the work.  These payments resemble piecework payments with the important
distinction that generally a “fee” is paid for the kind of jobs that are unique
rather than for a series of jobs repeated an indefinite number of times, and
for which payment on an identical basis is made over and over again.  Payments
based on the number of hours or days worked and not on the accomplishment of a
single task are not payments on a fee basis.</p><p>29
CFR § 541.605(a) </p><p>(b)  
To test whether a fee payment meets the minimum level
required for exemption, consider the time worked to complete the job and
determine if the payment is at a rate that would yield at least $455 per week
if the employee worked 40 hours.  For example, an artist paid $250 for a
picture that took 20 hours to complete meets the minimum $455 requirement for
exemption since earnings at this rate would yield the artist $500 if 40 hours
were worked.</p><p>29
CFR § 541.605(b) </p><p><b>(c)  
</b><b>Piece rate and percentages of hourly rates charged
do not constitute a “fee basis.” </b></p><p>A
“fee basis” is an agreed sum for a single job without regard to the time
required for its completion. Payments based on an amount per transaction or per
line are more properly viewed as “piece rate” payments. A payment based upon a
percentage of hourly amounts billed or charged to a client is, likewise, not a
payment on a “fee basis.” </p><p>WHD

              <h3>22g09. Board, lodging or other facilities.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
To qualify for exemption under 29 CFR part 541, an employee
must earn the minimum required salary amount “exclusive of board, lodging or
other facilities.”  This phrase means payment of the required salary amount
must be “free and clear” or independent of any claimed credit for non-cash
items of value that an employer may provide to an employee.  Thus, the costs
incurred by an employer to provide an employee with board, lodging or other
facilities may not count towards the minimum salary amount required for
exemption.  Such separate transactions are not prohibited between employers and
their exempt employees, but the costs to employers associated with such
transactions may not be considered when determining if an employee has received
the full required minimum salary payment. See 29 CFR § 541.606. </p><p>WHD
FLSA Opinion Letter March 7, 1969 </p><p>(b)  
29 CFR part 531 defines what constitutes “board, lodging,
or other facilities.”  As described in 29 CFR § 531.32, the term “other
facilities” refers to items similar to board and lodging, such as meals
furnished at company restaurants or cafeterias or by hospitals, hotels, or
restaurants to their employees; meals, dormitory rooms, and tuition furnished
by a college to its student employees; merchandise furnished at company stores
or commissaries, including articles of food, clothing, and household effects;
housing furnished for dwelling purposes; and transportation furnished to
employees for ordinary commuting between their homes and work.</p>

minimum salary due to a reduction in the employee’s normal scheduled workweek
is permissible and will not defeat the exemption, provided that the reduction

salary basis requirement (e.g., a 20 percent reduction in an exempt employee’s
salary while assigned to work a normally scheduled four-day reduced workweek

              <h3>22g13. Deductions from salary or from leave/paid time off (PTO) banks.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Employers are free to require use of leave, thus reducing
time available in a leave bank, at any time. Since leave time is not required
by the FLSA, there is no prohibition against an employer giving vacation time
and later requiring that such vacation time be taken on a specific day. </p><p>WHD
Letter FLSA 2005-41NA  </p><p>(b)  
Section 541.602(b)(1) states that “deductions from pay may
be made when an exempt employee is absent from work for one or more full days
for personal reasons.”  Salary deductions, therefore, may be made when
exempt employees voluntarily take time off for personal reasons, other than
sickness or disability, for one or more full days.  For instance, an
exempt employee paid $500 per week on a salary basis may take voluntary time
off for personal reasons for four days in a workweek and receive one fifth of
the salary.  The employee’s decision to take voluntary time off, however,
must be completely voluntary and not “occasioned by the employer or by the
operating requirements of the business.”</p><p>29
CFR § 541.602(a)   </p><p>WHD
Opinion Letter FLSA 2009-14</p><p>(c)  
An employer may require use of leave for periods of
inclement weather, either in whole or partial day increments. If the firm is
open for operations, the employer may make deductions from salary for one or more
whole days of absence if the employee chooses to not report to work. A
deduction for an employee’s choice to not report to work during a period of
adverse weather is a deduction for personal reasons, other than sickness or
disability. If the firm is not open for operations, the employer must pay the
full amount of the salary due for any week in which the employee performs any
work. Neither an employee’s status as a probationary employee, nor the fact
that an employee may have a zero or negative accrued leave balance, provides an
excuse for the employer to pay less than the full amount of salary required to
maintain the employee’s salary basis status if the firm is not open for
operations.</p><p>WHD
Letter FLSA 2005-41NA </p><p>WHD
Letter FLSA 2005-46NA</p><p>(d)  
An employer may require exempt employees to use accrued
vacation time during a plant shutdown of less than a workweek without violating
the salary basis test. Likewise, an employer may require employees to use paid
time off to accommodate staffing levels needed during a period of reduced
workload.</p><p>Since
employers are not required under the FLSA to provide any vacation time to
employees, there is no prohibition against an employer giving vacation time and
later requiring that such vacation time be taken on a specific day(s). 
Therefore, an employer may direct exempt staff to take vacation or debit their
leave bank account, whether for a full or partial day’s absence, provided the
employees receive in payment an amount equal to their guaranteed
salary.  </p><p>WHD
Opinion Letter FLSA 2009-02 </p><p>(e)  
Mandatory unpaid time off, when required for increments of
less than a full work week, in order to accommodate day-to-day or week-to-week
fluctuations of business will violate the requirement to pay on a salary basis.
This differs from a situation where a salary is reduced prospectively to
reflect a bona fide reduction in normal scheduled hours. (See FOH 22g10.)</p><p>WHD

              <p>Deductions
may be made from an exempt employee’s paid time off (PTO) bank for both full
and partial day absences, without affecting the employee’s exempt status. In
such instances, the full salary is paid to the employee. If the PTO bank may be
used for absences related to sickness or disability, when an employee’s PTO
bank is exhausted, an employer may make deductions for one or more full days of
absence without affecting the payment on a salary basis. Such deductions are
made in “accordance with a bona fide plan, policy or practice of providing

workweek schedule.</h3>
              <p>An
extended workweek schedule is a definite schedule of hours longer than the
regular workweek for a temporary period (e.g., a month or more).  For example,
an employee who is normally scheduled to work an eight-hour day, five-day
workweek may be scheduled to work five days of nine hours or six eight-hour
days.  (A change in the workweek that is intended to be (or in fact is)
permanent is not an extended workweek schedule as discussed herein.) </p><p>Because
the payment of extra compensation to a bona fide exempt employee for working an
extended schedule is an addition to, rather than a part of, the employee’s
predetermined salary, deductions of all or part of the extra compensation when
the employee fails to work the full extended workweek schedule will not be regarded
as a deduction from the employee’s predetermined salary. This assumes that the
extra compensation is bona fide and is not paid to facilitate otherwise
prohibited deductions from the guaranteed salary.</p>

terms is compliance with the salary basis of payment required under 29 CFR part

there is a waiting period for each illness before benefits are paid. See 29 CFR

is a matter to be determined between the employer and the employee.  An

make up the time as required or to work the required number of hours does not
constitute a violation of a “workplace conduct rule” for which an employer may

              <h3>22h01. Emergencies.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
An exempt employee does not lose exempt status by
performing work of a normally nonexempt nature because of an emergency.  When
emergencies occur that threaten the safety of employees, a cessation of
operations or serious damage to the employer’s property, any work performed in
an effort to prevent such results is considered exempt work.  Emergencies
arising out of an employer’s business and affecting the public health or
welfare may qualify under this provision, applying the same standard as
emergencies that affect the safety of employees or customers.</p><p>(b)  
“Emergency” does not include events that are not beyond
control or for which the employer can reasonably provide in the normal course
of business.  Emergencies generally occur only rarely, and are events that the
employer cannot reasonably anticipate. </p><p>(c)  
The following examples from 29 CFR § 541.706(c) illustrate
the distinction between emergency work considered exempt work and routine work
that is not exempt work:</p><p>(1)  A mine
superintendent who pitches in after an explosion and digs out workers who are
trapped in the mine is still a bona fide executive.  </p><p>(2)  Assisting nonexempt
employees with their work during periods of heavy workload or to handle rush
orders is not exempt work.</p><p>(3)  Replacing a nonexempt
employee during the first day or partial day of an illness may be considered
exempt emergency work depending on factors such as the size of the
establishment and of the executive’s department, the nature of the industry,
the consequences that would flow from the failure to replace the ailing
employee immediately, and the feasibility of filling the employee’s place
promptly.</p><p>(4)  Regular repair
and cleaning of equipment is not emergency work, even when necessary to prevent
fire or explosion; however, repairing equipment may be emergency work if the breakdown
of, or damage to, the equipment was caused by accident or carelessness that the
employer could not reasonably anticipate.</p><p>(d)  
The foregoing list of situations where exempt employees
could perform nonexempt work without losing their exempt status is not meant to
be exhaustive.  Other similar instances where exempt employees perform nonexempt
work under unanticipated circumstances should be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis.  However, it continues to be DOL’s position that nonexempt work may not
routinely be assigned to an exempt employee solely for the convenience of the
employer without calling into question the applicability of the exemption to
that employee.</p><p>69

employees, but are the means for an exempt employee to properly carry out
exempt functions and responsibilities, are considered exempt work.  The
following factors should be considered in determining whether such work is
exempt work:  whether the same work is performed by any of the exempt
employee’s subordinates; practicability of delegating the work to a nonexempt
employee; whether the exempt employee performs the task frequently or
occasionally; and existence of an industry practice for the exempt employee to
perform the task.  </p><p>29

CFR § 541.708 allows for “tacking” or combining exempt work under one category
of the exemptions to exempt work under another category when determining if an
employee’s primary duty is to perform exempt work.  Thus, employees who perform
a combination of exempt duties for the executive, administrative, professional,
outside sales or computer exemptions may still qualify for exemption.  For
example, an employee whose primary duty involves a combination of exempt
administrative and exempt executive work may qualify for exemption.  In other
words, work that is exempt under one section of 29 CFR part 541 will not defeat
the applicability of the exemption under any other section. Employees who meet
the primary duty test as a result of “tacking” or combining exempt work must
also meet the other requirements of the exemption.</p><p>69

rate of at least $695 a week, is exempt if paid a proportionate amount (based
on a week of not more than 6 days) for any week in which the employee does not
work a full workweek for any reason. Moreover, an otherwise exempt employee in
this industry qualifies for exemption if the employee is employed at a daily
rate under the following circumstances: </p><p>(1)  The employee is
in a job category for which a weekly base rate is not provided and the daily
base rate would yield at least $695 if 6 days were worked; or </p><p>(2)  The employee is

Under 29 CFR § 541.710, an employee of a public agency who
otherwise meets the salary basis requirements of 29 CFR § 541.602 will not be
disqualified from exemption under 29 CFR §§ 541.100, 541.200, 541.300 or
541.400 on the basis that the employee is paid according to a pay system
established by statute, ordinance or regulation, or by a policy or practice
established pursuant to principles of public accountability, under which the
employee accrues personal leave and sick leave and which requires the public
agency employee’s pay to be reduced or such employee to be placed on leave
without pay for absences for personal reasons or because of illness or injury
of less than one work-day when accrued leave is not used by an employee
because:  </p><p>(1)  Permission for
its use has not been sought or has been sought and denied,</p><p>(2)  Accrued leave
has been exhausted, or</p><p>(3)  The employee

CFR part 541 provides examples of particular occupations to demonstrate how to
apply the regulatory concepts defining the exemptions in those situations. Some
of the examples were also presented in the prior regulations. Note that while
the examples may be useful in understanding how to apply the regulations to
specific occupations, in order for an exemption to apply in a particular case,
it is still necessary to confirm that an employee actually performs exempt

issued by the Wage and Hour Administrator, respond to a fact-specific inquiry. Certain
examples below include only summaries taken from opinion letters. The opinion
letter cited should be reviewed for a fuller discussion. A slight difference in
the facts may result in a different outcome. Also, while the examples may
provide useful guidance regarding the application of 29 CFR part 541 for a
particular occupation, it must be remembered that a job title alone is
insufficient to establish the exempt status of an employee. The exempt or
nonexempt status of any employee must be determined on the basis of whether the

agents for a land-acquisition service.</h3>
              <p>WHD
has found acquisition agents, relocation agents, and property management agents
to be exempt as follows (see FOH 22i00):</p><p>(a)  
Acquisition Agents. </p><p>Acquisition
Agents (AAs) are employed to perform various tasks relating to the acquisition
of property for the employer’s clients. The AAs are responsible for purchasing
the property by negotiating with the property owners, analyzing property
appraisals, and making recommendations to the client using real estate
practices, legal concepts, governmental standards, and regulations. The AAs
represent the client in negotiations with the property owners and attorneys.
They regularly recommend to the client whether a reasonable compromise is
likely and further negotiations should be pursued, or whether to pursue
condemnation litigation. If the property owner has a legitimate basis for
seeking a substantially higher amount, the employees can recommend such
increases to the client. If the negotiation process fails, the AAs prepare the
lawsuit packages for condemnation proceedings, assist the client’s attorney,
and serve as an expert witness in mediation or trial. The AAs are also
responsible for preparing for the real estate closing, including preparing
closing documents. </p><p>When
the duties performed are those described above, the Acquisition Agents qualify
for the administrative exemption. The type of work performed by the AAs is
directly related to the general business operations of the employer’s clients.
As noted in 29 CFR § 541.201(b), work in the functional areas of purchasing,
procurement, and legal and regulatory compliance qualifies as work that is
directly related to management or general business operations. Additionally,
the many responsibilities of the AAs meet the discretion and independent
judgment standard. The AAs interpret management policies, negotiate, consult
with and provide expert advice to management, and bind the client financially
on significant matters, as discussed in several of the factors found in 29 CFR
§ 541.202(b). Furthermore, the AAs are similar to the insurance claims adjusters
listed as exempt in 29 CFR § 541.203, because they are responsible for
inspecting and determining the value of property including unique real
property, negotiating settlements, and making recommendations regarding
litigation when necessary. </p><p>(b)  
<b>Relocation Agents. </b></p><p>Relocation
Agents (RAs) assist in property appraisal and provide relocation assistance to
the owners and tenants of the property purchased by the client. The RAs
evaluate possible replacement properties and make recommendations as to the
amount of the “replacement housing payment” to be paid to the displaced
property owner. The RAs conduct research and analyze the best options for the
property owners. They also analyze possible alternative properties under
federal law. The RAs provide advice to the property owner on the moving process
and any relocation assistance that might be available to them. The RAs can also
make recommendations to the client to offer additional payments to the property
owner or to extend the occupancy period given to the displaced property owner.
They represent the client in appeals of the relocation payment amount, serving
as expert witnesses in administrative appeals and/or in litigation. Where the
tenant of the property is a business, the proceedings can be especially
complicated because there often is tenant-installed equipment or machinery
and/or significant build-outs by the tenant. In such cases, the relocation
benefits can be as much as a million dollars, and RAs have saved clients
hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time in appeals of business relocation
payments. The RAs also assist the property owner in preparations for the
property closing. </p><p>When
the duties performed are those described above, the Relocation Agents qualify
for the administrative exemption. The type of work performed by the RAs is
directly related to the general business operations of the employer’s clients.
Like the AAs, the RAs work in the functional areas of procurement, government
relations, and legal and regulatory compliance, which are management and
general business operations functions. See 29 CFR § 541.201(a). The RAs
exercise discretion and independent judgment as to significant matters by
analyzing housing alternatives, recommending “replacement housing payments,”
and advising the client on significant financial matters. See 29 CFR
§ 541.202(b). The RAs are also similar to the insurance claims adjusters
listed as exempt in 29 CFR § 541.203 because they are responsible for
inspecting property, evaluating and making recommendations regarding the
“replacement housing payment,” negotiating settlements with property owners,
and representing management in any appeals. </p><p>(c)  
<b>Property Management Agents. </b></p><p>The
Property Management Agents (PMAs) serve as spokespersons and representatives of
the client. They are responsible for dealing with governmental authorities,
utility companies, contractors and other consultants during the conversion of
the property for public use. They are responsible for contacting and developing
rapport with various local officials and explaining the project in order to
develop good relationships and ensure compliance with the law. Additionally,
they must protect the client’s investment by working with the officials to keep
the property safe from possible vandals and by making police reports in the
event of vandalism. The PMAs work with environmental consultants to address
environmental issues such as the presence of asbestos and to ensure compliance
with environmental protection laws. The PMAs coordinate all of their work and
develop an Operations and Maintenance Plan to ensure that the consultants and
contractors follow proper procedures. The PMAs also coordinate and direct the
demolition of the property, including preparing detailed specifications prior
to the bidding, advertising for bids, and conducting pre-bid meetings to explain
the project prior to accepting bids for the demolition work. They have
authority to use their knowledge and experience with contractors to select
preferred contractors from an approved list or to shop for the best price for
the work. After selection, the PMAs oversee and evaluate the work of all
contractors.</p><p>When
the duties performed are those described above, the Property Management Agents
are exempt administrative employees. A PMA’s primary duty of serving as a
liaison between the client and various government agencies qualifies as
management and general business operations because it involves government
relations and legal and regulatory compliance. In addition, their work during
the bid process and in the selection of contractors relates to purchasing and
procurement, and their oversight activities involve quality control. The PMAs
implement management policies, carry out major assignments, and negotiate on
behalf of the company on significant matters, thereby fulfilling the exercise
of discretion and independent judgment requirement. See 29 CFR
§ 541.202(b).</p><p>WHD

              <h3>22i07.  Analysts ‑product  technology and marketing.</h3>
              <p>A
Product Technology and Marketing Analyst (PTA) who worked for a firm that
provides products and services to prevent soil erosion and strengthen retaining
walls and foundations of parking lots, bridges, levees, and buildings was found
to be an exempt administrative employee. </p><p>The
PTA’s primary responsibility was to work independently with the company’s
Engineering and Design Group (EDG) to develop tests that measure the
performance of new products and assess the feasibility of novel uses of current
products.  For example, if an existing product has the potential to
stabilize and reinforce the lining of coal mine tunnels in a remote region, the
PTA reviews all relevant information regarding the environmental conditions and
the features of the mine.  The PTA then works with the EDG to develop a
test to measure the product’s performance under varying conditions.  The
PTA evaluates numerous factors, including the type of equipment needed to
create the precise environmental conditions and accurately capture the test
results.  Approximately 40 percent of the PTA’s working time is spent with
the EDG on tests for new and existing products.</p><p>Additionally,
approximately 30 percent of the PTA’s time is spent as a liaison to the
company’s sales professionals, who visit potential and current customers. 
During these visits, the sales professionals are confronted with questions from
customers regarding specific features/uses of the company’s products and how
they compare to competing products.  The sales professionals rely on the
PTA to provide them guidance on the appropriate responses to these customer
inquiries.  The PTA independently reaches conclusions regarding testing
methodology, testing results, and product performance that allow the company to
secure product sales by demonstrating that the company’s products meet customer
specifications or are superior to competing products.  </p><p>The
remainder of the PTA’s time is spent performing standardized tests on the
company’s products and preparing reports reflecting the test results and how
they compare to competitors.  The PTA reports directly to the company’s
Vice President of Process and Product Development.  The PTA receives at
least $455 per week on a salary basis.</p><p>The
PTA’s duty of working with the EDG to develop tests that measure the
performance of new products and assess the feasibility of novel uses of current
products directly relates to the functional areas of quality control and
research.  The PTA’s duty of performing standardized tests on company
products and preparing reports on how those products compare to competitors’
products also directly relates to the functional area of research.  Other
duties, including assisting sales representatives in responding to customer
questions regarding specific features/uses of the company’s products, and
evaluating product features for potential customers, directly relate to the
functional area of marketing.  Therefore, the PTA’s primary duties involve
the “performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management
or general business operations of the employer or the employer’s
customers.”  </p><p>Section
541.202(b) sets out several factors to consider when determining whether an
employee exercises discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters
of significance. Examples of duties indicating the PTA “carries out major
assignments in conducting the operations of the business” include working
independently with the EDG to develop tests that measure performance of the
company’s new products and assess the feasibility of novel uses of the
company’s current products.  Also, in determining how specific
features/uses of the company’s products compare to competing products,
evaluating features within the context of scenarios posed by sales
professionals working in the field with customers, and making important
conclusions that allow the company to secure product sales, the PTA “performs
work that affects business operations to a substantial
degree.” Accordingly, the PTA’s primary duties “include the exercise of
discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of
significance.”  See FOH 22i00.</p><p>WHD

individuals with disabilities.</h3>
              <p>Case
managers employed by a company which is a service provider for individuals with
disabilities were found to not be exempt under the administrative test. 
The company worked with physicians and other third parties to help consumers
with disabilities increase their self-sufficiency at home and in the
community.  The primary duty of case managers was to meet and to work with
consumers to gather information, to assess each consumer’s needs, to assess the
costs of care, to prepare a plan of care, and to identify and to implement
services to meet the consumer’s needs.  Case managers did not personally
deliver or administer services to the consumers, but were responsible for
planning and helping to obtain those services from third-party service
providers.</p><p>Case
managers did not operate pursuant to written protocols or formulas. 
Rather, case managers drew upon their education and experience to identify and
to procure whatever group of services may be appropriate for each consumer,
maximizing that consumer’s ability to live outside an institution (such as a
group home, assisted living center, nursing home, or state hospital). 
Case managers may have sought information and input from colleagues and other
resources, but were independently responsible for developing a plan of care for
each consumer.  Each plan of care was, by necessity, driven by the
individual needs and abilities of the consumer.  A plan of care may have included
services such as advocacy/case management, independent living skills training,
peer support, physical therapy, cognitive therapy, speech therapy, occupational
therapy, or vocational rehabilitation.</p><p>Case
managers also monitored the delivery of services in coordination with the
consumer and third-party service providers.  In addition, case managers
assisted consumers with related matters, including consumers’ eligibility for
benefits through Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and private insurance.</p><p>Case
managers performed their work free from direct supervision.  Case managers
developed and implemented plans of care without the requirement of approval by
a superior, but their work was regularly reviewed by a company vice president
for quality and timeliness.</p><p>The
activities performed by these case managers were more related to providing the company’s
ongoing, day-to-day case management services for its consumers, which involved
duties such as assessing costs of care, preparing a plan of care, and identifying
and implementing services to meet the consumers’ needs, rather than performing
administrative functions directly related to managing either the company’s
business or any business of the company’s customers.  A case manager was
not primarily tasked with performing duties in any of the management or general
business functional areas described in 29 CFR § 541.201(b); nor was the case
manager primarily tasked with providing administrative services to the
employer’s customers as contemplated in 29 CFR § 541.201(c).  Therefore, case
managers did not qualify for the administrative exemption. See FOH 22i00.</p><p>WHD

imagination, originality or talent, such as that involved in regularly creating
or designing unique dishes and menu items, may be considered for exemption as a
creative professional depending upon the facts.  However, there is a wide
variation in duties among chefs, and the creative professional exemption must
be applied on a case-by-case basis with particular focus on the creative duties
and abilities of the specific chef in question.  The Department intends that
the creative professional exemption extend only to truly “original” chefs, such
as those who work at five-star or gourmet establishments, whose primary duty is
the performance of work “requiring invention, imagination, originality or
talent.”</p><p>69

              <p>A
construction project superintendent employed by an environmental engineering
and consulting company that performs construction projects on miscellaneous
government sites was found to be an exempt executive. The project
superintendent’s primary function was to supervise the day-to-day activities of
the construction project.  The superintendent oversaw the work of
subcontractors employed on the project and supervised the labor force employed
for the project, consisting of regular company personnel, project-specific
temporary personnel, and/or union personnel.  The superintendent usually
supervised at least two employees, if not more, throughout the duration of the
project.  The superintendent met with the client’s representatives, made
decisions regarding the scope of work of subcontractors, made purchasing
decisions as needed for the project, and reported and made recommendations to
the project manager regarding employee advancement, firing, and change of
status.  The superintendent was paid far in excess of $455.00 per
week. </p><p>The
project superintendent’s duties are included in the type of activities
constituting “management” within the meaning of the regulations.</p><p>Under
29 CFR § 541.100(a)(3), an exempt executive employee must “customarily and
regularly direct the work of two or more other employees.”  “Two or more
other employees” means two full-time employees or their equivalent.  29 CFR
§ 541.104(a).  Only other employees employed by the same employer may
be considered when making this determination under the executive exemption; the
supervision of employees of independent contractors, subcontractors, or any
other “non-employees” in relation to the employer are not considered for
purposes of meeting this test.  Assuming that the project superintendent
customarily and regularly supervises two employees who are employed by the
superintendent’s employer, this requirement is satisfied.  The failure to
meet this aspect of this test, however, would result in denial of the executive
exemption. See FOH 22i00.</p><p>WHD

              <p>Book
club copy editors, employed by a direct marketing firm, whose duties included
the following, did not meet the administrative exemption test because they
performed “production” duties:</p><p>(a)  
Reading club marketing promotional materials prepared by
copywriters and making any necessary corrections for structure, grammar,
comprehension, spelling, clarity, and accuracy,  </p><p>(b)  
Correcting the keying of test versions, checking for

“production versus staff” dichotomy is instructive when evaluating whether duties
are directly related to management or general business operations, but not
dispositive of exempt status. But, when work falls “squarely on the production
side of the line,” the administration/production dichotomy is determinative.</p><p>The
primary duty of the copy editors described above falls squarely on the

thus, the employees are nonexempt. Their primary duty also involves the use of

IT Support Specialist (renamed from Help Desk Support Specialist) who is
responsible for the diagnosis of computer-related problems, conducts problem
analysis and research, troubleshoots, resolves complex problems either in
person or by using remote control software, and ensures timely closeout of
trouble tickets is not exempt as an administrative or professional employee.</p><p>The
IT Support Specialist position required a high school diploma or GED, although
an associate degree was preferred.  </p><p>WHD
has found that an IT Support Specialist who spent time on such duties as
described below was not exempt under either the administrative or computer
professional categories:</p><p>Analyzes,
troubleshoots, and resolves complex problems with business applications,
networking, and hardware.  Accurately documents all work in appropriate
problem tracking software.  Prioritizes tasks based on service level
agreement criteria with limited supervision (55%).</p><p>Installs,
configures, and tests upgraded and new business computers and applications
based upon user-defined requirements.  Assists users in identifying
hardware/software needs and provides advice regarding current options,
policies, and procedures.  Creates and troubleshoots network accounts and
other business application user accounts as documented in the employee
lifecycle process (20%).</p><p>Participates
in the design, testing, and deployment of client configurations throughout the
organization.  This process requires detailed knowledge of Microsoft
operating systems and compatible business applications.  Leverages
application packaging software technology for deployment of business applications
to client systems (10%). </p><p>Participates
in the analysis and selection of new technology required for expanding
computing needs throughout the organization.  Works with competing vendors
to determine the best selection based on price, technical functionality,
durability, manufacturer support, manufacturer vision, and position in the
healthcare industry (5%).</p><p>Documents
technical processes and troubleshooting guidelines.  Documents end-user
frequently asked questions about computer systems or programs and publishes on
Intranet as guidelines for the entire organization (5%). </p><p>Monitors
automated alerts generated by systems management tools and makes decisions on
the most effective resolution (5%).</p><p>Although
the upkeep of a computer system may be viewed as essential to an employer’s
business operations, the nature of the individual employee’s particular work,
and not the possible results or consequences of its performance, is the focus
of the analysis for determining if a particular employee is exempt.  To
qualify as an exempt administrative employee, therefore, the work performed
must itself relate to significant matters in the management or general business
operations of the employer.  In addition, performing highly skilled
technical work in troubleshooting computer problems does not, by itself,
demonstrate the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to
matters of significance.  As stated in 29 CFR § 541.202(e), “[t]he
exercise of discretion and independent judgment must be more than the use of
skill in applying well-established techniques, procedures or specific standards
described in manuals or other sources.” </p><p>The
primary duty of the IT Support Specialist as described above consists of
installing, configuring, testing, and troubleshooting computer applications,
networks, and hardware.  Maintaining a computer system and testing by
various systematic routines to see that a particular piece of computer
equipment or computer application is working properly according to the
specifications designed by others are examples of work that lacks the requisite
exercise of discretion and independent judgment within the meaning of the
administrative exemption.  Employees performing such activities are using
skills and procedures or techniques acquired by special training or
experience.  Their duties do not involve, with respect to matters of
significance, the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct,
and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been
considered as required by 29 CFR § 541.202(a).  Such work does not
involve formulating management policies or operating practices, committing the
employer in matters that have significant financial impact, negotiating and
binding the company on significant matters, planning business objectives, or
other indicators of exercising discretion and independent judgment with respect
to matters of significance discussed in 29 CFR § 541.202(b). 
Although minor aspects of the work (described as five to ten percent) include
participating in the design of client configurations and analyzing and
selecting new technology, the description of the tasks performed and the
decisions made by an IT Support Specialist does not demonstrate that their
primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with
respect to matters of significance to the management or general business
operations of the employer.  Therefore, the IT Support Specialist position
does not qualify for the administrative exemption under section 13(a)(1) of the
FLSA. </p><p>With
respect to the Computer Employee Exemption, the following analysis applies: The
primary duty of the IT Support Specialist consists of installing, configuring,
testing, and troubleshooting computer applications, networks, and
hardware.  The primary duty of this employee does not involve the
“application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting
with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications.”  29 CFR § 541.400(b)(1).  Nor is the primary
duty of the IT Support Specialist “[t]he design, development, documentation,
analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs,
including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design
specifications,” see 29 CFR § 541.400(b)(2), “[t]he design, documentation,
testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating
systems,” 29 CFR § 541.400(b)(3), or “[a] combination of these duties, the
performance of which requires the same level of skills,”  29 CFR
§ 541.400(b)(4).  Because the primary duty of the IT Support
Specialist as described does not consist of duties similar to those discussed
in 29 CFR § 541.400(b)(1)-(4), the IT Support Specialist position does not
qualify for the computer professional employee exemption under FLSA sections
13(a)(1) and 13(a)(17).  See FOH 22i00.</p><p>WHD

standardized lines involving well-established techniques and procedures which

sector inspectors or investigators of various types, such as police officers,
criminal investigators, liquor law investigators, probation officers, parole
agents, fire prevention or safety inspectors, building or construction
inspectors, health or sanitation inspectors, environmental or soils specialists
and similar employees, generally do not meet the duties requirements for the
administrative exemption because their primary duty typically does not involve
work “directly related to the management or general business operations of the
employer.” Rather, their primary duty involves producing the services that
their agency exists to produce. For example, in law enforcement organizations,
investigation activities are among the primary functions of the “business.” 
Therefore, investigations are more related to the day-to-day operations than to
the management or general business operations. </p><p>Such
employees also do not typically qualify for the administrative exemption
because their work involves the use of skills and technical abilities in
gathering factual information, applying known standards or prescribed
procedures, determining which procedure to follow, or determining whether
prescribed standards or criteria are met. Thus, the primary duty does not
typically include the exercise of discretion or independent judgment with
respect to matters of significance to the management or general business
operations of the employer.</p><p>Public

              <p>Assistant
Athletic Instructors (AAIs) at colleges may qualify for exemption as teachers
under section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA and 29 CFR § 541.303.   </p><p>AAIs
teach proper skills and skill development to student-athletes and are required
to have a bachelor’s degree with a master’s degree (or additional experience)
preferred.  Their teaching responsibilities include instruction of physical
health, team concepts, and safety.  The AAIs, who work under the supervision of
a head coach, are responsible for designing instructions for individual
student-athletes and for specific team needs, and thus have a great deal of
independent discretion and judgment as to the manner and method of teaching. 
Students receive academic credit for their participation in collegiate team
sports. </p><p>Under
Reg. 541 a teacher is “any employee with a primary duty of teaching, tutoring,
instructing or lecturing in the activity of imparting knowledge and who is
employed and engaged in this activity as a teacher in an educational
establishment by which the employee is employed.” An AAI whose teaching
responsibilities encompass at least 50% or more of their time and include
instruction of physical health, team concepts, and safety is meeting the
primary duty test needed for the Reg. 541 teacher exemption. </p><p>There
is no minimum education or academic degree required under the regulations for
the teacher exemption.  Athletic instructors whose primary duty is teaching in
an educational establishment would qualify for the exemption whether or not
they have a particular academic degree.  By contrast, athletic instructors
whose primary duty is not related to teaching would not qualify for the teacher
exemption.  Also, the regulations do not require that exempt teachers be paid
on a salary basis.  Having a primary duty of teaching generally involves, “by
its very nature, exercising discretion and judgment.”  </p><p>The
following duties are not related to teaching: developing effective recruitment
strategies; recruiting and following up on prospective students; researching
and targeting high schools and athletic camps as sources for potential
student-athletes; and visiting high schools and athletic camps to conduct
student interviews.  The amount of time spent is such duties must be considered
when determining whether the AAI meets the primary duty test for exemption as a
teacher. Colleges generally would qualify as educational establishments for
purposes of the teacher exemption.  An “educational establishment” is defined
as “an elementary or secondary school system, an institution of higher learning
or other educational institution.” </p><p>Where
AAIs spend more than 50% of their time teaching in an educational
establishment,  they qualify for exemption from the FLSA’s minimum wage and
overtime pay requirements. See FOH 22i00.</p><p>WHD

              <h3>22i23.  Insurance claims adjusters.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Insurance claims adjusters generally meet the duties
requirements for the administrative exemption, whether they work for an
insurance company or other type of company, if their duties include activities
such as interviewing insureds, witnesses and physicians; inspecting property
damage; reviewing factual information to prepare damage estimates; evaluating
and making recommendations regarding coverage of claims; determining liability
and total value of a claim; negotiating settlements; and making recommendations
regarding litigation.  </p><p>29
CFR § 541.203(a) </p><p><b>(b) 
</b><b>Varying levels of authority.</b></p><p>In
the insurance industry, there are insurance claims adjusters with varying
levels of authority.  The claims adjusting duties performed by these
individuals when it is in the functional area of insurance is work directly
related to management or general business operations of the employer or the
employer’s customers and thus meets the second criteria of the administrative
exemption test.</p><p>In
order to qualify for the administrative exemption, the employee must also meet
the third criteria of the exemption test, “…primary duty must include the
exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of
significance.” Generally, the exercise of discretion and independent judgment
involves comparing and evaluating possible courses of conduct and then acting
or making a decision after considering the various possibilities.  The term
“matters of significance” refers to the level of consequence or importance of
the work performed.  The exercise of discretion and independent judgment
includes the employee’s authority to make independent choices free of immediate
supervision but does not preclude higher level review. An indicator of the claims
examiner’s exercise of discretion and independent judgment is the level of
supervision. For example, does the claims adjuster’s supervisor only spot-check
work or must the adjuster seek approval from a supervisor for settlements?</p><p>The
exercise of discretion and independent judgment must be more than applying
specific standards or procedures found in manuals. The following are examples
of duties performed by claims adjusters that are more than applying specific
standards: evaluating independent medical examinations, evaluating
investigations of accident scenes, hiring and interacting with nursing services
to assist claimants to return to work, approving litigation strategy,
participating in hiring experts, serving as lead negotiator in settlement
discussions and using their own judgment about what the facts show, who is
liable, what a claim is worth, and how to handle negotiations with the claimant
in order to achieve a successful resolution.</p><p>Claims
adjusters who perform their duties under close supervision or in consultation
with supervisors and who have no, or limited authority, to make independent
choices do not meet the third criteria of the administrative exemption. See FOH

gathering evidence; interviewing witnesses; reviewing medical, financial,
employment and other data; preparing reports for review by a client or superior;

provides such services to clients for a fee. The activities performed by
investigators are more related to providing ongoing day-to-day investigative
services - the production work of the employer-than they are to exempt

make decisions on whether to further pursue a given lead, and make other

              <p>Location
Managers, who typically choose a location for filming with approval from the
director and production management, negotiate the site’s rental, contract for
all necessary utilities, apply for all necessary governmental services and
permits, create and enforce rules specific to the filming locations based on
that site’s specific circumstances and designed to comply with state and local
law, act as a liaison between the production company and local property owners
and residents, and secure final rental payment for the property owner including
negotiating any claim of property damage, have been found exempt.  </p><p>Before
the 2004 revisions to the part 541 regulations, Location Managers of motion
picture companies were specifically cited as a type of qualifying
administrative employee who performed special assignments away from the
employer’s place of business.  Based upon their duties––such as selecting
locations, entering into rental agreements, and developing and implementing
rules for employees to follow on location––it appears that the Location
Managers are primarily engaged in the budgeting, procurement, and personnel
management functions described in 29 CFR § 541.201 as types of work
directly related to assisting with the running or servicing of the employer’s
business. </p><p>The
Location Managers’ primary duties include the exercise of discretion and
independent judgment.  For example, the Location Manager formulates
management policies when creating and enforcing regulations for the production
crew based upon the site’s requirements.  Also, the Location Manager
commits the employer in financial matters and negotiates and binds the company
regarding significant matters when the Location Manager chooses the location,
negotiates the site’s rental, obtains contracts with local private resources,
obtains necessary permits from local government, and represents the company’s
position to the property owner.  Finally, the Location Manager represents
the company when acting as a liaison between the company and the property owner
and any disgruntled local residents, and when resolving the final balance of
account between the company and property owner, including whether the company
owes for any damages done to the rental property.  Such activities involve
the requisite exercise of discretion and independent judgment.</p><p>Accordingly,
the position of Location Manager, as described above, satisfies the
requirements for the administrative exemption. See FOH 22i00.</p><p>WHD

the primary duty of a convention and visitors service sales manager employed by
a city is performing office or non-manual duties that are directly related to
management or general business operations of the employer, the second test of
the administrative exemption is met. Examples of such duties include the
following: marketing and promotional work to enhance the city as a destination
for conventions and visitors; working closely with the local hospitality
industry and other city departments to coordinate conventions and ensure
efficient meeting arrangements for the attendees; conducting research to
identify potential clients; preparing and presenting bids for meetings and
conferences; designing promotional brochures and flyers; attending conferences
of professional meeting planners and exhibit show associations to generate
leads; handling computerized database bookings; and preparing bills for
payment. The employee might also perform some clerical and support services for
the convention and visitors services director as needed. This employee is
engaged in marketing activities that are intended to enhance the city’s image
as a potential meeting place and thus promote economic growth.  </p><p>When
the employee operates under only minimal supervision, researches and selects
potential clients, designs and creates promotional materials, and prepares and
presents bids for meetings and conferences to potential clients, determines
what amenities the city will offer to a group and the level of staffing the
city will provide to assist a group, these duties include the exercise of
discretion and independent judgment in matters of significant economic impact
on the city. </p><p>Although
the employee is required to perform clerical and support duties for the
convention and visitors services director as needed, this nonexempt work does
not appear to be the employee’s primary duty. Thus, the employee performing

              <p>A
Loss Prevention Manager (LPM), employed by a retailer, who has the primary duty
of effectively implementing a loss prevention and shortage control program by,
among other duties:</p><p>(a)  
Analyzing inventory results,</p><p>(b)  
Allocating store Loss Prevention resources to successfully
reduce inventory shortage,</p><p>(c)  
Focusing prevention activities on high shortage departments,</p><p>(d)  
Identifying paperwork control weaknesses and implementing

Conducting audits for compliance and ensuring store
follow-up on price accuracy initiatives, </p><p>(f)  
Reviewing cash discrepancies to keep the store within
allowable guidelines, and identifying cash registers with unacceptable
shortages, and</p><p>(g)  
Regularly reviewing loss prevention exception reports for
signs of dishonesty,is performing work which directly relates to the functional
areas of accounting, auditing, and quality control discussed in 29 CFR § 541.201(b),
and thus may qualify as an exempt administrative employee.</p><p>Duties
performed by the LPM such as interviewing all loss prevention candidates,
conducting and supervising training for subordinates on a continual basis, and
providing direction for subordinates also directly relate to the functional
areas of personnel management and human resources.  Ensuring training standards
for associates regarding emergency procedures, robbery, fire, etc.,  is work
directly related to the functional area of safety and health. An LPM’s typical
work day consists of performing office or non-manual work. Therefore, the LPM’s
primary duty involves the “performance of office or non-manual work directly related
to the management or general business operations of the employer.” </p><p>A
typical LPM’s primary duty “includes the exercise of discretion and independent
judgment with respect to matters of significance.” An LPM who is working
independently has certain decision-making authority that is “free from
immediate direction or supervision.”  When selecting appropriate steps to
address the problem of inventory shortage and pursuing the selected course of
action, an LPM compares and evaluates possible courses of conduct, and acts or
makes a decision after the various possibilities have been considered as
discussed in 29 CFR § 541.202(a). The LPM’s primary duty of implementing the
loss prevention and shortage control program for a store, and supervisory work
where an LPM is in charge of subordinates, demonstrates that the employee
“implement[s] management policies or operating practices.”  When implementing
the loss prevention and shortage control program for the store, the LPM
“performs work that affects business operations to a substantial degree”
because the effective performance of such duty is essential for the
profitability of the store and, in fact, frequently determines the store’s
success or failure. When developing store-specific programs to meet or exceed the
store’s shortage goals, the LPM “carries out major assignments in conducting
the operations of the business.”  In determining what internal investigations
to pursue and when to conduct interviews, in ascertaining prosecutable cases,
and in investigating harassment allegations, the LPM “investigates and resolves
matters of significance on behalf of management.”  In addition, in consulting
with and providing expert advice to store management with respect to the loss
prevention and shortage control program, the LPM “provides consultation or
expert advice to management.”  Therefore, the LPM’s duties meet several of the
factors in 29 CFR § 541.202(b) indicating the sufficient “exercise of
discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance”
and, as such, may qualify for the administrative exemption. See FOH 22i00.</p><p>WHD

Registered or certified medical technologists who have
successfully completed three academic years of pre-professional study in an
accredited college or university plus a fourth year of professional course work
in a school of medical technology approved by the Council of Medical Education

<b>Radiology technologists.</b></p><p>Radiology
technologists (RTs) have been found not to be exempt from the minimum wage and
overtime requirements of the FLSA. The RT’s primary duty does not require
“advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a
prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.” Their work has been
found not to be “work which is predominantly intellectual in character, and
which includes work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and
judgment, as distinguished from performance of routine mental, manual,
mechanical or physical work.”</p><p>The
RT position requires successful completion of a two-to-three-year radiology
technology program accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in
Radiologic Technology or some other manner of accreditation acceptable to the
American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT).  The RTs must pass
an ARRT examination for registration.  To renew the ARRT registration, an
RT must meet certain continuing education requirements every two years.</p><p>The
requirement that an RT complete a two- to three-year radiology technology
program accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic
Technology (or some other manner of accreditation acceptable to the ARRT),
along with an ARRT examination for registration, does not meet the “advanced
knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged
course of specialized intellectual instruction” standard.</p><p>Duties
of RT’s have been found to be: reviewing physicians’ orders for patient
examinations; ensuring that the examining room is properly prepared for the
procedure; visiting patients to determine their tolerance to the examination
and positioning; preparing patient information cards that are included on the
film for identification; positioning the patients to assure that the
radiologist can see and access the proper area for the imaging procedure;
administering contrast and other chemicals orally or intravenously; setting
technical factors on equipment, such as penetration and length of the imaging
power; checking radiation and imaging power factors for safety to the patient,
technologist, and equipment; and operating the equipment for radiation and
other imaging power exposure.  RTs take the film to the darkroom for
automatic processing and evaluate the adequacy of the film for reading by the
radiologist.  As needed, the RTs take additional images.  They may
also assist the radiologist in understanding particular cases and images
taken. </p><p>Following
the procedures, the RTs return patients to their proper area; clean tables and
change linens; clean cassettes, aprons, gloves, and wheelchairs; check
cassettes for contact and leakage, and aprons and gloves for leakage; and clean
the film processor as required.  They ensure that proper notations are
made in the patients’ records, and participate in maintaining departmental
files, coordinating and scheduling of patients, and maintaining department
inventories.  The RTs maintain records of use according to state and
federal regulations.  They perform daily instrument calibration procedures
on all instruments, make minor repairs to equipment, and report any major
equipment problems to the department head.  RTs carry out all of their
duties without the need for constant supervision.</p><p>Although
the RTs’ work involves the use of advanced skills and procedures that are
vitally important to the professional work of the radiologist who analyzes and
interprets the images, the RTs’ work does not appear to be “work which is
predominantly intellectual in character, and which includes work requiring the
consistent exercise of discretion and judgment, as distinguished from
performance of routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work.” 
29 CFR § 541.301(b).  The procedural work performed by the RTs
is highly skilled and requires significant training, but seems to be more in
the character of routine mental, manual, mechanical and physical processes than
intellectual work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and
judgment.  The “learned professional” activity in this area is the
practice of medicine involved in the analysis and interpretation of the images
developed, which is performed by the radiologist. See FOH 22i00</p><p>WHD

              <p>In
the financial service industry, there are persons classified as “mortgage loan
officers,” “mortgage loan consultants,” “mortgage loan representatives,” “mortgage
loan originators,” “mortgage bankers,” and similar titles. The following are
typical duties of these individuals, referred to here as mortgage loan
officers: </p><p>(a)  
Contact potential customers after receiving internal leads,
leads generated by direct mail or other marketing activity,</p><p>(b)  
Collect required financial information from customers,
including information about income,</p><p>(c)  
Run credit reports,</p><p>(d)

the terms and conditions of particular loans,</p><p>(f)  
Match customer needs with one of the company’s loan
products,</p><p>(g)  
Compile customer documents to forward to underwriter or
loan processor, and </p><p>(h)  May
finalize documents for closing.</p><p>The
primary duty of mortgage loan officers performing the typical duties shown
above is making sales. These duties are the production work of the employer
rather than duties which are directly related to the management or business
operations of the employer. Mortgage loan officers typically perform their
duties for homeowners, who are not involved in management or general business
operations contemplated by these regulations; therefore, a typical mortgage
loan officer’s primary duty is not related either to the employer’s management
or general business operations or to those of the employer’s customers.</p><p>A
mortgage loan officer who performs the typical duties described above has a
primary duty of making sales for the employer and, therefore, does not qualify
as a bona fide administrative employee exempt under section 13(a)(1) of the
FLSA. See FOH 22i00.</p><p>Administrator’s

the primary duty of a museum curator is performing non-manual duties that are
directly related to management or general business operations of the employer,
the second test of the administrative exemption is met. Examples of such duties
include the following: maintaining the quality of the museum collection in
accordance with museum management principles and practices (quality control);
soliciting and evaluating additions to the museum’s collection (similar to
purchasing); developing educational components to present information regarding
the exhibits (research); assisting in fundraising and writing grant proposals
(finance and budgeting); managing special projects such as collecting oral

of the administrative exemption. Examples of duties that curators perform that
indicate the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to
matters of significance are the following: establishing and implementing
volunteer tour guide programs (formulating operating practices); developing
education materials to be presented by volunteer guides (formulating operating
practices); developing the changing exhibits (implementing operating

              <p>WHD
has found Certified Occupational Therapist Assistants (COTAs) employed by a
school district to be nonexempt as learned professionals.  </p><p>The
primary duty of a COTA is assisting occupational therapists in providing
therapeutic educational programs for students.  According to the school
district’s COTA job description, the only educational requirement is that which
is sufficient to obtain certification by the state Board of Occupational
Therapy Examiners.  One of the prerequisites for certification by the state is
the completion of “at least 60 academic semester credits or the equivalent from
an accredited institution of higher education.” </p><p>The
primary duty test under the learned professional exemption requires that:</p><p>(a)  
The employee must perform work requiring advanced knowledge,
</p><p>(b)  
The advanced knowledge must be in a field of science or
learning, and </p><p>(c)  
The advanced knowledge must be customarily acquired by a
prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.  </p><p>COTAs
did not meet the primary duty test. The COTAs’ primary duty does not require
“knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily
acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.” 
Occupations that “require only a four-year degree in any field or a two-year
degree as a standard prerequisite for entrance into the field . . . do not
qualify for the learned professional exemption.”  69 FR 22121, 22150 (Apr. 23,
2004). Completion of 60 semester hours does not qualify as a “prolonged course
of specialized intellectual instruction. COTAs also did not meet the definition
of a registered or certified medical technologist.  The regulations contain
specific academic requirements for exemption:</p><p>Registered
or certified medical technologists who have successfully completed three
academic years of pre-professional study in an accredited college or university
plus a fourth year of professional course work in a school of medical
technology approved by the Council of Medical Education of the American Medical
Association generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional
exemption.  </p><p>29
CFR § 541.301(e)(1).  Becoming a COTA only requires 60 semester hours of study,
rather than the more rigorous course of study required for registered or
certified medical technologists.    </p><p>The
existence of a mandatory, accredited certification program for COTAs, standing
alone, does not satisfy the regulatory requirement for a prolonged course of
specialized intellectual instruction for entry into the field.  </p><p>Accredited curriculums and certification programs are
relevant to determining exempt learned professional status to the extent they
provide evidence that a prolonged course of specialized intellectual
instruction has become a standard prerequisite for entrance into the occupation
as required under section 541.301.  Neither the identity of the certifying
organization nor the mere fact that certification is required is determinative,
if certification does not involve a prolonged course of specialized intellectual
instruction.</p><p>69
FR at 22157</p><p>Consequently,
because the occupational therapist assistant occupation does not require
“knowledge of an advanced type . . . customarily acquired by a prolonged course
of specialized intellectual instruction,” these employees do not qualify for
the “learned professional” exemption.  </p><p>Additionally,
the COTAs do not qualify for the exemption for administrative employees in
educational establishments.  See 29 CFR § 541.204.  Section 541.204 provides an
exemption for employees “whose primary duty is performing administrative
functions directly related to academic instruction or training in an
educational establishment or department or subdivision thereof.”  29 CFR §
541.204(a)(2).  Section 541.204(c)(2), however, states that “jobs relating to
the health of the students . . . do not perform academic administrative
functions” and do not fulfill the requirements for the educational
establishments exemption. See FOH 22i00.</p><p>WHD

              <p>(a)  
Paralegals and legal assistants generally do not qualify as
exempt learned professionals because an advanced specialized academic degree is
not a standard prerequisite for entry into the field.  Although many paralegals
possess general four-year advanced degrees, most specialized paralegal programs
are two-year associate degree programs from a community college or equivalent
institution.  See FOH 22i00.</p><p>29

Letter FLSA 2005-09NA</p><p>WHD
Letter FLSA 2005-54NA</p><p>(b)  
<b>Paralegals with a specialized 4-year degree.</b></p><p>The
learned professional exemption may be available for paralegals who possess
advanced specialized degrees in other fields and apply advanced knowledge in
that professional field in the performance of their paralegal duties. For
example, if a law firm hires an engineer as a paralegal to provide expert
advice on product liability cases or to assist on patent matters, that engineer
would qualify for the learned professional exemption. See FOH 22i00.</p><p>WHD
Letter FLSA 2005-09NA </p><p>(c)  
<b>Paralegals – Administrative exemption.</b></p><p>The
work of paralegals and legal assistants will not generally meet the discretion
and independent judgment test of the administrative exemption and thus an
analysis of whether their work is related to management or general business
operations is not necessary. Paralegals perform duties using particular skills
and knowledge rather than exercising the level of discretion and independent
judgment required by section 29 CFR § 541.202(a)(3). When paralegals research
and prepare reports, it is generally the attorneys who exercise discretion and
independent judgment because they receive and decide whether or how to act on
the information in the reports. </p><p>Although
paralegals may work independently and use their own judgment as to how to
prioritize their work assignments, including how the projects will be executed
and how much time to spend on each assignment, it is not sufficient that an
employee makes decisions regarding relatively insignificant matters or that an
employee makes limited decisions, within clearly “prescribed parameters.” See
Clark v. J.M. Benson Co., Inc., 789 F.2d 282, 287-88 (4th Cir. 1986) and
Dalheim v. KDFW-TV, 706 F. Supp. 493, 509 (N.D. Tex. 1998), aff’d, 918 F.2d
1220 (5th Cir. 1990). Rather, there must be the exercise of discretion and
independent judgment on matters of significance or consequence related to the
management or general business operations of the employer or the employer’s
customers.</p><p>A
typical paralegal does not formulate or implement management policies, utilize
authority to waive or deviate from established policies, provide expert advice,
or plan business objectives as required to be exempt under 29 CFR § 541.202(b).
In addition, most jurisdictions have strict prohibitions against the
unauthorized practice of law by laypersons. Under the American Bar
Association’s Code of Professional Responsibility, a delegation of legal tasks
to a lay person is proper only if the lawyer maintains a direct relationship
with the client, supervises the delegated work, and has complete professional
responsibility for the work produced. The implication of such strictures is
that paralegal employees would not have the amount of authority to exercise independent
judgments with regard to legal matters necessary to bring them within the
administrative exemption. See FOH 22i00.</p><p>WHD

              <p>School
Resource Officers (SROs) employed at an independent school district qualified
for the administrative exemption.</p><p>The
SROs’ primary duty was to provide for the safety and security of the students,
staff, and property within the school system by planning to prevent safety and
security problems and by responding immediately to deal with any disruption or
criminal activity.  Among their qualifications, SROs were licensed
pursuant to the state’s Peace Officer’s Standards and Training
Certification.  The SROs’ duties included providing consulting advice to
school administrators on plans for safety, emergency preparedness, traffic
flow, evacuation, lighting, and video surveillance, as well as other
safety/security issues; providing training to students, faculty,
administrators, and parent groups regarding safety issues, such as personal
safety, gun safety, bus safety, and drug and gang awareness; coordinating
security for extracurricular events; serving as liaison/facilitator between the
school system and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate the law
enforcement efforts of the local jurisdiction with regard to the schools, and
to develop a communication network between administration, staff, students and
parents within the “cluster” schools; creating and maintaining written case
files of criminal acts by students and reports of deprived, abused, or
neglected children and sharing this information with the school administrator,
school social worker, agencies in the law enforcement and judiciary systems,
and the local family and children’s services department, when appropriate;
advising regarding what law enforcement measures are appropriate when the
school administrator or SRO believes an incident is a violation of the law;
investigating suspected criminal activity on school property; and making
arrests on school property.  </p><p>In
performing the duties above, the SRO decided whether a situation requires
immediate action, whether to charge a violation, whether to make an arrest, and
whether to refer a case to the district attorney for prosecution.  The SRO
independently determined and planned his or her daily work schedules (e.g.,
whether to visit a particular school at a particular time and what to do at
that location).  In addition, the SRO’s recommendations to faculty and
staff were usually implemented (e.g., advice on fire drills, lighting,
landscaping, traffic flow, safety, and emergency preparedness plans).  The
SRO also provided training to faculty, staff, and students and made purchases
on behalf of the school (e.g., buying safety equipment).</p><p>Each
SRO had an office at a high school and served as the Resource Officer for a
cluster of schools, typically a high school and five to seven feeder middle and
elementary schools.  An SRO’s typical work day consisted of working in an
office at a high school writing reports or performing similar desk work,
performing training, providing advice to faculty and staff, working in the
field patrolling, and doing investigative work.  The field work was
incidental to the SRO’s primary duty, which is office work, and did not require
physical stamina or repetitive movements.  The SRO was minimally
supervised by the Manager of Safety and Security.  Moreover, in certain
cases, some of the cluster schools may employ security guards, but the SRO has
no direct supervisory responsibility over the security guards in such
cases.  The SRO has an annual discretionary budget of $15,000 to $20,000
for purchasing safety/security related items, such as cameras and traffic
safety cones.  Purchase orders above the discretionary budget require
supervisory approval.  The SROs are paid at least $455 per week on a
salary basis.</p><p>The
SROs performed office or non-manual work because an SRO’s typical work day
consisted of working in an office writing reports or performing similar
deskwork, performing training, and providing recommendations and advice to
faculty and staff.  In addition, any field work performed by the SRO is
incidental to the SRO’s primary duty, which was office work, and did not
require physical stamina or repetitive movements.  The SROs’ primary duty
of providing for the safety and security of the students, staff, and property
within the school system by planning to prevent safety and security problems and
by responding immediately to deal with any disruption or criminal activity,
which may include, for example, providing consulting advice to school
administrators on plans for safety, emergency preparedness, traffic flow,
evacuation, lighting, and video surveillance and providing training to
students, faculty, administrators, and parent groups regarding safety-related
issues, directly related to the functional areas of safety and health discussed
in 29 CFR § 541.201(b). </p><p>The
SROs’ employers were public educational entities rather than police departments
or security companies whose primary operations were law enforcement and
security, and as a result, the SROs’ activities could not be categorized as
production operations for their employers.  Therefore, the SROs’ primary
duty involved the “performance of office or non-manual work directly related to
the management or general business operations of the employer.”  29 CFR
§ 541.200(a)(2).</p><p>The
primary duty of the SRO’s described above “includes the exercise of discretion
and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.”  29 CFR
§ 541.200(a)(3).  The SRO is minimally supervised.  The SRO has
an annual discretionary budget of $15,000 to $20,000 for purchasing
safety/security related items. Such duties as providing the extensive
recommendations and advice noted above to faculty and staff that are usually
implemented satisfy one of the regulatory factors in 29 CFR § 541.202(b)
for determining whether an employee exercises discretion and independent
judgment with respect to matters of significance, specifically, that the
“employee provide consultation or expert advice to management.” In addition, by
serving as a liaison/facilitator between the school system and local law
enforcement agencies to coordinate the law enforcement efforts of the local
jurisdiction relative to the schools, and to develop a communication network
between administration, staff, students, and parents within the cluster
schools, the SRO formulates and implements management policies or operating
practices. See 29 CFR § 541.202(b). See FOH 22i00.</p><p>WHD
