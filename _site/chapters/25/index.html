engaged in fire protection activities or any employee engaged in law
enforcement activities (including security personnel in correctional
institutions) if -</p><p>(1)  in a work period of 28 consecutive days the employee
receives for tours of duty which in the aggregate exceed 240 hours; or</p><p>(2)  in the case of such an employee to whom a work period
of at least 7 but less than 28 days applies, in his work period the employee
receives for tours of duty which in the aggregate exceed a number of hours
which bears the same ratio to the number of consecutive days in his work period
as 240 hours bears to 28 days (60 hours in a work period of 7 days),
compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at
which he is employed.</p><p>(b)  
Effective 1/1/76, OT compensation
must be paid for hours in excess of 232 in a work period of 28 days (58 hours
in a work period of 7 days) or in the case of any work period between 7 and 28
days, a proportionate number of hours in such work period.</p><p>(c)  
Effective 1/1/77, OT compensation

days, a proportionate number of hours in such work period.</p><p>(d)  
Effective 1/1/78, OT compensation
must be paid for hours which exceed the lesser of: (A) 216 hours, or (B) the
average number of hours in tours of duty during 1975 (as determined by the
Secretary in a study conducted pursuant to Sec 6(c)(3) of the FLS Amendments of
1974) in a work period of 28 days or in the case of a work period between 7 and

Sec 13(a)(5) provides an exemption
from the MW and OT provisions of FLSA for “any employee employed in the
catching, taking, propagating, harvesting, cultivating, or farming of any kind
of fish, shellfish, crustacea, sponges, seaweeds, or other aquatic
forms of animal and vegetable life, or in the first processing, canning or
packing such marine products at sea as an incident to, or in conjunction with,
such fishing operations, including the going to and returning from work and
loading and unloading when performed by any such employee”. This exemption was
not changed by the 1974 Amendments.</p><p>(b)  
Effective 5/1/74 Sec 13(b)(4)
provides an exemption from the OT provisions of FLSA for “any employee employed
in the canning, pro­cessing, marketing, freezing, curing, storing, packing for
shipment, or distributing of any kind of fish, shellfish, or other aquatic
forms of animal or vegetable life, or any byproducts thereof and who receives
compensation for employment in excess of 48 hours in any workweek at a rate not
less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.”</p><p>(c)  
The phrase “and who receives
compensation for employment in excess of 48 hours in any workweek at a rate not
less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed” was
added to the Act by the 1974 Amendments effective 5/1/74. Consequently, prior
to 5/1/74 employment within the terms of this exemption was completely exempt
from OT.</p><p>(d)  
Effective 5/1/75 Sec 13(b)(4) is
amended by changing “48 hours” to “44 hours”; consequently, effective on this

repealed and OT is due after 40 hours per week.</p><p>(e)

              <p>(a)  
Fish farming is included in the
term “farming in all its branches” and an employee performing such activities
is engaged in agriculture within the meaning of Sec 3(f) (see FOH 20b04 and IB
780.109) . It may also be necessary in some situations to consider the

The applying Sec 13(a)(5), the
activities named in the exemption and such other activities as are so
functionally related to the named operations that they are, as a practical
matter, necessarily and directly a part of the named operations are considered
to be exempt activities. Thus, the repairing and cleaning of fish ponds, the
fertilization and breeding of fish, and the sorting of fish are exempt
activities. Also exempt, when performed as an integral part of the above
operations (see IB 784.113), would be the maintenance and repair of the tools
and equipment used in the above operations . The construction of new ponds or
buildings is not an exempt activity under Sec 13(a)(5).</p><p>(c)

connection, the maintenance of records which are an integral part of the Sec
13(a)(5) exempt fish farming activities, such as the maintenance of breeding
records, records of feed consumption related to fish production and the like,
would be considered as exempt activities under Sec 13(a)(5).</p><p>(d)

              <p>(a)  
Effective 5/1/74, Sec 13(b) (28)
exempts from the OT provisions of the FLSA “any employee employed in planting
or tending trees, cruising, surveying or felling timber, or in preparing or
transporting logs or other forestry products to the mill, processing plant,
railroad, or other transportation terminal, if the number of employees employed
by his employer in such forestry or lumbering operations does not exceed
eight”. (Emphasis added by underscoring.)</p><p>(b)  
For the period 2/1/67 - 4/30/74,
the wording of old Sec 13 (a)(13) was identical to current Sec 13(b)(28);
however, Sec 13(a)(13) was both a MW and OT exemption.</p><p>(c)  
Prior to 2/1/67 the wording of Sec
13(a)(15) was identical to Sec 13(a)(13) except that the number of employees
read “does not exceed twelve” instead of “does not exceed eight”. (Emphasis
added.)</p><p>(d)  
Under the Act as amended, the exemption
continues to be in applicable in any w/w where the number of employees employed
by the employer in the named operations exceeds twelve. The MW standard of Sec
6(a)(l) and OT after 40 hours applies to such employment. Beginning 5/1/74, in
any w/w where all the tests of Sec 13(b)(28) are met except that the number of
employees exceeds eight but does not exceed twelve, the exemption does not
apply and the MW standard of Sec 6(b) and OT after 40 hours apply. In any w/w
where all the tests of the exemption are met, the MW rate of Sec 6(b) applies
and the employment is exempt from OT.</p><p>(e)  
The principles in IB 788 shall be
followed in applying Sec 13(b)(28) effective 5/1/74 and old Secs 13(a)(13) and
13(a)(15) prior to 5/1/74, and for rate purposes; the number twelve shall be
substituted for the number eight as appropriate. In the same manner the
principles stated in FOH 25e01 through 25e08 are applicable for purposes of
Secs 13(a)(13), 13(a)(15), and 13(b)(28).</p>

              <p>(a)  
The exemption from OT provided by
FLSA Sec 7(j) for employers engaged in the operation of a hospital is explained
in Sec 778.601 of IB Part 778. This section supplements IB 778.601.</p><p>(b)  
The exemption in Sec 7(j) applies
to employees of employers engaged in the activities comprising the operation of
a hospital.</p><p>(1)  Employees of the hospital entity.</p><p>Employees employed by
the hospital entity may be subject to Sec 7(j). This includes not only the
typical hospital employees who work in the hospital but may also include, for
example, employees of an employer who owns and operates or operates pursuant to
a contract more than one hospital, who are engaged in performing the following
services for the hospitals: public relations, payroll, accounting,
administrative services, engineering, architecture and planning, community
relations, and personnel and labor relations and remodeling</p><p>(2)  Employees employed in hospital operations.</p><p>Employees in the
various medical laboratories and therapy services located in the hospital and
operated by the employer exclusively as an integral and essential part of the
hospital may be subject to Sec 7(j). Such employees must be employed in
medically related activities connected with the operation of the hospital. On
the other hand where the laboratory or therapy services are only providing a
service to the hospital and operate as an independent business which is not
part of the hospital enterprise, Sec 7(j) will not apply to their employees
because they are not deemed “employed by” an ‘employer engaged in the operation
of a hospital”. Similarly, an independent contractor providing nonmedically
related services, such as a contractor who provides janitorial or maintenance
services to a hospital may not use Sec 7(j) since the contractor is not engaged
in the medically related operations of a hospital.</p><p>Further, an employer engaged in the operation of a hospital may not
utilize the provision to relieve himself of his obligations under Sec 7(a) of
the Act with respect to any of his employees who devote a substantial part of
their worktime in the w/w to activities other than those in connection with the
operation of the hospital, such as custodial work for other tenants who occupy
leased space in the building. Such nonexempt work wilt be considered
substantial if it occupies more than 20% of the time worked by the employee in
the w/w.</p><p>(c)  
Employees of a temporary help
company working on assignments in hospitals are considered to be jointly
employed by both the temporary help company and the hospital in which they are
employed. For enforcement purposes, Wage-Hour will not take exception to a
claim by a hospital that Sec 7(j) applies during any 14-day period where the
employees work exclusively for a single hospital provided that before
performance of the work am agreement is made between the hospital and the
employees to use the 14-day period in lieu of the normal w/w. This position is
taken without prejudice to the rights of individual employees under Sec 16(b).
On the other hand, Sec 7(j) will not apply to any employee who during a 14-day
work period is employed in more than one hospital even though all such
hospitals may be operating under Sec 7(j) with respect to their regular
employees.</p>

rate of pay for salaried employees under Sec 7(j) is determined in the normal
manner (see FOH 32b04) except that the “14-day period” is used rather than the
w/w. Thus for example an employee may be paid a salary intended to compensate
for up to 80 hours in a 14 day period in which case his regular rate would be
obtained by dividing his bi-weekly salary by 80 and he would be due 11/2 times
this rate for each OT hour in the 14-day period.</h4><h4>(b)   Where a swing shift
rotation results in an employee working two 8-hour shifts within a 24 hour
period, as defined in IB 778.601(d), the employee would be entitled to receive
OT compensation at a rate not less than one and one half times his regular rate
of pay for the hours worked on the second 8-hour shift. This is true
irrespective of the fact that the second 8-hour work period in the workday is a
regular part of the 80 hours scheduled biweekly by the hospital or the fact
that the second 8-hour shift starts the second 40-hour work period in the
14-day period. It should be noted that such premium for daily OT may be
credited towards OT compensation due for hours in excess of 80 for that period.</h4>

              <p>(a)  
Sec 13(a)(3) provides an exemption
from the MW and OT provisions of the FLSA for “any employee employed by an
establishment which is an amusement or recreational establishment, organized
camp, or religious or non-profit educational conference center if (A) it does
not operate for more than seven months in any calendar year, or (B) during the
preceding calendar year, its average receipts for any six months of such year
were not more than 33 1/3 per centum of its average receipts for the other six
months of such year”.</p><p>(b)  
An “organized camp’
characteristically provides room and board in a rustic setting over a sustained
period of time. An “organized camp” is one with a program of activities and
sustained supervision, provided for a set fee. The American Camping Association
defines a “camp” as “a sustained experience which provides a creative
recreational and educational opportunity in group living in the out of doors.
It utilizes trained leadership and the resources of natural surroundings to
contribute to each camper’s mental, physical, social, and spiritual growth.”</p><p>(c)  
A “religious or nonprofit
educational conference center “is a meeting center providing for religious,
educational and leadership growth experiences for both youth and adults. They
are usually built in secluded and scenic areas and often provide residence
accommodations, meal service and recreational facilities. Most are under the
sponsorship of religious denominations and are operated on a nonprofit and
tax-exempt basis.</p>

              <p>(a)  
An “amusement or recreational
establishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference
center” will be exempt under Sec 13(a)(3) of the amended Act, if it meets
either test (A) or test (B) as explained in (b) and (c) below.</p><p>(b)  
“(A) Does not operate for more
than seven months In any calendar year”.</p><p>An amusement or recreational establishment, organized camp, or
religious or nonprofit educational conference center will be exempt if “it does
not operate for more than seven months in any calendar year”. Whether an
establishment “operates” during a particular month is a question of fact, and
depends on whether it operates as an amusement or recreational establishment,
organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference center. If an
establishment engages only in activities such as maintenance operations or
ordering supplies during the “dead season”, it is not considered to be
operating for purposes of the exemption.</p><p>(c)  
(B) 33 1/3% test.</p><p>(1)  An amusement or recreational establishment, organized
camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference center will be exempt if
“during the preceding calendar year, its average receipts for any six months of
such year were not more than 33 1/3 per centum of its average receipts for the
other six months of such year”. Since the language of the statute refers to
receipts for any six months (not necessarily consecutive months), the monthly
average based on total receipts for the six individual months in which the
receipts were smallest should be tested against the monthly average for six
individual months when the receipts were largest to determine whether this test
is me</p><p>(2)  To illustrate the principles in (1) above, consider an
amusement or recreational establishment, organized camp, or religious or
nonprofit educational conference center that is in a covered Sec 3(s)(1) 1)
enterprise as defined by the amended Act. The establishment operated for nine
months in the preceding calendar year. The establishment was closed during Dec.,
Jan., and Feb. The total receipts for May, June, July, Aug., Sept., and Oct.
(the six months in which the receipts were largest) totaled $260,000, a monthly
average of $43,333; the total receipts for the other six months totaled
$75,000, a monthly average of $12,500. Since the average receipts of the latter
six months were not more than 33 1/3% of the average receipts for the other six
months of the year, the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption will apply.</p>

in the National Wildlife Refuge System.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Establishments such as those
selling groceries, curios, and dry goods, as well as gas stations, hotels,
motels, restaurants and the like, are generally not within the categories of
establishments which are commonly recognized as inherently of an amusement or
recreational character within the meaning of Sec 13(a)(3) of the Act. However,
certain such establishments in national parks, forests, or the Wildlife Refuge
System, are limited by policy of the Interior or Agriculture Departments to
merchandising only those items and providing only those services appropriate
for the public use and enjoyment of the areas administered by them. These
establishments operate under an exclusive contract with these Departments and
only during the season when these areas are open to the public. Under these
circumstances, the activities of these establishments are considered to have a
sufficiently intimate relation to the operation of these recreational areas to
warrant their characterization as “amusement or recreational” establishments.</p><p>(b)  
As provided in Sec 13(a)(3), this
exemption from MW (Sec 6) and OT (Sec 7) “does not apply with respect to any
employee of a private entity engaged in providing services or facilities (other
than, in the case of the exemption from Sec 6, a private entity engaged in
providing services and facilities directly related to skiing) in a national
park or a national forest or on land in the National Wildlife Refuge System,
under a contract with the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of
Agriculture;”</p><p>(c)  
However, such employees, although
subject to the MW, may qualify for a partial exemption from OT as provided in
Sec 13(b)(29):</p><p>“any employee of an amusement or recreational establishment located in
a national park or national forest or on land in the National Wildlife Refuge
System if such employee (A) is an employee of a private entity engaged in
providing services or facilities in a national park or national forest, or on
land in the National Wildlife Refuge System, under a contract with the
Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture, and (B) receives
compensation for employment in excess of fifty-six hours in any workweek at a
rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is
employed.”</p><p>(d)  
In order to qualify for exemption
under Sec 13(b)(29), one of the seasonality tests contained in Sec 13(a)(3)
must be met by the establishment. Moreover, the possible application of CWHSSA
to mechanics and laborers employed by such an establishment should not be
overlooked.</p>

Resort hotels are generally not

13(a)(3). However, if a resort hotel operates a particular facility (such as a golf
course or swimming pool) as a separate establishment, employees of such an
establishment might qualify for exemption under Sec 13(a)(3) from MW and OT if

Where a resort hotel is located in
a national park, national forest, or on lands in the National Wildlife Refuge
System, such establishment is characterized as an “amusement or recreational”
establishment (see FOH 25j02(a) above), and its employees would be subject to
MW and to OT after 56 hours in the w/w under Sec 13(b)(29) (see FOH 25j02(c)

              <p>(a)  
For purposes of applying Sec
13(a)(3), the general principles set forth in IB 779.308 - 779.311 apply. Thus
an employee, to be exempt, must be “employed by” the exempt establishment. In
some situations, such as an amusement park, baseball park, or racetrack, food
and souvenir vendors are employed by a concessionaire on the premises. If the
operations of the concessionaire constitute a separate establishment, the tests
of Sec 13(a)(3) are applied to the concessionaire’s establishment separately
without regard to the operations of the host establishment. On the other hand,
if the concessionaire and host constitute a single establishment, as is usually
the case, the tests apply on the basis of all the operations of the
establishment, including those of the concessionaire. (See IB 779.302 -
779.306.)</p><p>(b)  
Employment in central functions of
an organization operating more than one such establishment, as in the case of
employees of a central office, warehouse, garage, or commissary which serves a
chain of exempt “amusement or recreational” establishments would not be within
the exemption under Sec 13(a)(3).</p><p>(c)  
The word “establishment” has the

              <h3>25j08.  “New business” - application of Tests A and B.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Tests A and B refer to a calendar
year throughout which the operations of the establishment can be tested to
determine its character as a seasonally operated place of business. In the case
of a new business, Tests A and B are to be applied as follows:</p><p>(1)  Test A.</p><p>Generally, Test A is
not met by a new business establishment which has operated for no more than 7 months
in a calendar year for the reason that its business operations did not start
until a considerable portion of the year had elapsed. If, however, the
character of the establishment is that of an “amusement or recreational
establishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference
center” whose operations are shown by acceptable evidence to be subject to
seasonal factors which would require the establishment to cease operations for
five months or more in the calendar year even if it had been in business for
the entire calendar year, the new business establishment may meet the
requirements of Test A so that its employees will be exempt. For example, an
employer may open a new ski slope establishment in November under circumstances
where it is clear that the establishment would have operated less than seven
months in the year regardless of the date it began operations. In such a case
the establishment could claim the exemption under Test A.</p><p>(2)  Test B.</p><p>Test B is based on the
establishment’s experience “during the preceding calendar year.” Generally this
requires an entire year’s experience to apply Test B in order to make the
necessary calculation. However, in the case of a new business where there is no
“preceding calendar year” on which to apply Test B, WH will apply the following
criteria in determining the applicability of Sec 13(a)(3)(B):</p><p>a.    
If the enterprise of which the new
establishment is a part operates other seasonal amusement or recreational
establishments, organized camps, or religious or nonprofit educational
conference centers of the same type in the same general area under
substantially the same conditions and all such establishments conclusively and
clearly meet the condition of Test B; or</p><p>b.    
If such employer does not have
other such establishments but other employers operating the same type of
establishment in the same general area under substantially the same conditions
and manner of operation clearly are entitled to exemption under Test B.</p><p>(b)  
Wage-Hour will consider the
exemption applicable in the year the new establishment begins operation if
either of these tests are met provided, however, that in the event after a
year’s operation the establishment does not qualify under Test B, proper MW and
OT is paid retroactively.</p>

              <p>Some elementary or secondary schools or institutions of higher
education which are academically accredited during the fall through spring
semesters operate establishments that provide summer recreation or summer camp programs.
Where such programs meet the requirements of Sec 13(a)(3)(A) or (B) and are not
a part, continuation, or extension of the accredited academic program of the
school, such an establishment may qualify as “an amusement or recreational
establishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference
center” pursuant to the exemption, even though some credit courses may be
offered on a voluntary basis along with the recreational activities. The
applicability of Sec 13(a)(3) to employees of such an establishment is not
defeated by the fact that the same distinct physical place of business is for
part of the year a “school” and for part of the year “an amusement or
recreational establishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational

similar establishments are the type which may qualify for exemption under Sec
13(a)(3). Activities conducted during the summer months in a city’s parks such

activities which are in operation for not more than 7 months of the year may
also come within this exemption. Playground counselors, arts and crafts
instructors, and games leaders are the type of employees who may be exempt as

amusement and recreational activities directly related to the operation of a

              <p>(a)  
Campsites and campgrounds provide
facilities where the general public may camp in tents, campers, recreational
vehicles, travel trailers, or motor homes. They may include paved driveways and
furnish water, waste and electrical outlets, picnic benches and tables,
restrooms and showers, laundry facilities, ice houses, bottled gas and grocery
facilities, and provide for handling mail and various recreational pursuits.
The camping season usually runs from the end of May through the Labor Day
weekend, but in milder climates some campgrounds have a longer season and
others are open year-round.</p><p>(b)  
An exempt campsite or campground
operates and maintains its establishment as a functional amusement or
recreational unit, i.e., providing facilities for camping as a recreational
activity. It may provide swimming, boating, or fishing facilities as well as
facilities for various other amusement or recreational activities such as
volleyball, horseshoes, miniature golf, movies, dances, contests, bonfires, and
the like. It may be located on either state or local government or private
land. Such a campsite or campground may be considered an amusement or
recreational establishment for the purpose of Sec 13(a)(3) and tested for
exemption under clause (A) or (B) of that section.</p><p>(c)  
On the other hand, if a campsite
or campground merely provides space and parking facilities which the travelling
public uses while in transit to a recreational area (as opposed to (b) above),
the campsite or campground is not an amusement or recreational establishment
for purposes of Sec 13(a)(3). At such a facility the travelling public usually
stays for only a short period of time such as one or two nights.</p>

reason we have done this in the FOH is because extensive and exhaustive
research has made clear that the ‘74 Amendments contained an error in wording.
That is, in order to remain logically consistent with all that was stated on
the Record concerning this exemption, it is obvious that the word “and” rather
than “or” should have been printed between points (A) and (B):</p><p>see p. 10, Sec 17 of Public Law 93-259 in FOH Vol I. Thus, it has been
determined that the word “and’ is correct and should be used in construing the
exemption. That is why we put “and” in FOP. 25p00, and also why there are no
quotation marks at the beginning and end of the exemption, since it is not an
exact quotation.</p>
