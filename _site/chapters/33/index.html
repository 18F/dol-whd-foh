materials.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
FLSA §§ 3(l), 12, 13(c) and 13(d),
and 29 CFR part 570, are the basic source materials that govern the application
of the child labor (CL) provisions of the FLSA.  This chapter of the FOH
supplements these documents.</p><p>(b)  
<b>FLSA § 3(l) </b></p><p>(1)  FLSA § 3(l) defines “oppressive child labor” as a
condition of employment under which </p><p>a.    
Any employee under the age of
sixteen years is employed by an employer in any occupation, or </p><p>b.    
Where any employee between the
ages of sixteen and eighteen years of age is employed by an employer in any
occupation which the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) shall find and by order
declare to be particularly hazardous for the employment of children between
such ages or detrimental to their health or well-being.  </p><p>The
Secretary has declared 17 Hazardous Occupations Orders (HOs) for
nonagricultural employment which are contained in subpart E of 29 CFR part 570,
§§ 570.50 through 570.68. </p><p>(2)  FLSA § 3(l) gives the Secretary authority to issue
regulations governing the   employment of 14- and 15-year-old persons in
non-hazardous occupations other than  mining or manufacturing.  CL Regulation
No. 3 (subpart C of 29 CFR part 570), sets  forth the conditions of
employment for 14- and 15-year-old youths.  This employment is confined to
certain periods and conditions that do not interfere with    their schooling or
adversely affect their health and well-being.  </p><p>(c)  
FLSA § 12 generally prohibits the
shipment in commerce of any goods produced in an establishment in or about
which within thirty days prior to the removal of such goods any oppressive CL
was employed; prohibits the employment of oppressive CL in any enterprise
engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce; and authorizes
the Secretary to administer the provisions of the FLSA relating to oppressive
CL.  The two types of coverage established by FLSA §§ 12(a) and 12(c) are
discussed in detail in FOH 33a01 and 33a02 below.</p><p>(d)  
FLSA § 13(c), among other things,
contains the statutory exemptions pertaining to CL.  This section addresses the
employment of youth: in agriculture (§§ 13(c)(1), (2), and (4)); as actors or
performers in motion pictures or theatrical productions, or in radio or
television productions (§ 13(c)(3)); as loaders of compacting and/or baling
equipment (§ 13(c)(5)); as drivers of automobiles and trucks (§ 13(c)(6)); and
as employees of facilities where machinery is used to process wood products (§
13(c)(7)). </p><p>(e)  
FLSA § 13(d) contains exemptions
from FLSA §§ 6, 7, and 12 for the employment of workers engaged in the delivery
of newspapers to the consumer, and to any homeworker engaged in the making of
wreaths composed principally of natural holly, pine, cedar, or other evergreens
(including the harvesting of the evergreens or other forest products used in
making such wreaths).</p><p>(f)  
The employment of youths under 14
years of age is limited to work that is not subject to the FLSA or is exempt
from its provisions.  </p>

              <p>(a)  
Section 12(c) provides that “[n]o
employer shall employ any oppressive child labor in commerce or in the
production of goods for commerce or in any enterprise engaged in commerce or in
the production of goods for commerce.”  29 CFR 570.112 and 570.113 discuss the
provisions related to coverage under § 12(c).  </p><p>(b)  
Coverage for the prohibition of
the employment of oppressive CL under § 12(c) is the same as under §§ 6 and
7—individual coverage or enterprise coverage (see FOH Chapters 10,
11, and 12). </p>

            <div id="33a02">
              <h3>33a02.   CL Coverage—§ 12(a).</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Section 12(a) of the FLSA states
that “[n]o producer, manufacturer, or dealer shall ship or deliver for shipment
in commerce any goods produced in an establishment in the United States in or
about which within thirty days prior to the removal of such goods therefrom any
oppressive child labor has been employed.”  Such “goods” are referred to as
“hot goods” (see FOH 33a02(c)(1)b for an example of “hot goods”). 
29 CFR 570.104 through 570.111 contain the provisions related to
coverage under § 12(a).  </p><p>(1)  The term goods is defined in § 3(i) of
the FLSA as “goods [], wares, products, commodities, merchandise, or articles
or subjects of commerce of any character, or any part or ingredient thereof . .
.”  This definition expressly excludes goods after their delivery into the
actual physical possession of an ultimate consumer other than a producer,
manufacturer, or processor.  The term includes such items as foodstuffs,
clothing, machinery, printed materials, blueprints, and also includes
intangibles (see 29 CFR 570.107).  </p><p>(2)  The term commerce is defined in FLSA §
3(b) as meaning “trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or
communication among the several States or between any State and any place
outside thereof.” </p><p>(3)  The term oppressive child labor is defined in FLSA §
3(l).  For purposes of § 12(a), oppressive child labor can and does occur in
establishments whose minor employees are not covered on an individual or
enterprise basis under FLSA § 12(c) because the definition of oppressive child
labor does not require that the minor employees be covered under the FLSA.  </p><p>(b)  
Goods produced in an establishment
in or about which oppressive CL has been employed are barred as “hot goods” and
are prohibited from being shipped or delivered for shipment in commerce under §
12(a) if:</p><p>(1)  Such goods were removed from the establishment while
any oppressive CL was still being employed in or about it, or </p><p>(2)  Such goods were removed from the establishment within
30 days after the employment of oppressive CL had ceased in or about the
establishment.  </p><p>(c)  
The prohibitions of § 12(a) apply
only to the shipment of goods in commerce that were actually “produced” in and
removed from an establishment in or about which oppressive CL was employed.  </p><p>(1)  These hot goods provisions are applicable even though
the under-age employee does not himself or herself engage in the production of
the goods, as long as somewhere in the establishment in or about which he or
she is employed goods are “produced” which are subsequently shipped or
delivered for shipment in commerce.  It also does not matter if the youth’s
employment that constitutes the oppressive child labor is covered under FLSA §
12(c).</p><p>a.    
For example, § 12(a) would apply
where 14- or 15- year-old minors are employed to load milk on trucks at a dairy
establishment and deliver it to households if the dairy establishment produces
some of its goods for shipment in commerce.  This employment constitutes
oppressive child labor because such work is prohibited by § 570.33(k) and (n).</p><p>b.    
The hot goods provisions of §
12(a) would also apply in the following example.  A 15-year-old minor works as
a cashier in a small retail bakery that makes cakes and pies, some of which are
shipped, or delivered for shipment, in commerce.  Assume the minor does not
handle checks or credit card transactions.  Because the ADV of the enterprise
is under $500,000, the minor would not be covered on an “enterprise basis”
under § 12(c).  Because the minor is not “employed in commerce” or in the
“production of goods for commerce,” he or she is not covered on an individual
basis.  But if this minor’s employment was in violation of the child labor
standards—such as working until 10:00 p.m. in violation of the CL Reg 3 hours
standards—oppressive child labor would have occurred.  The products produced by
the baker during the period of the oppressive CL, and thirty days thereafter,
would be “hot goods” under § 12(a). </p><p>c.    
As explained in section (c)(4),
below, section 12(a) coverage also applies when a minor is employed by an
employer other than the establishment owner or operator if that minor performs
some work in or about the producing establishment.  </p><p>(2)  Section 12(a) only applies to “hot goods” and bars a
producer, manufacturer, or dealer from shipping or delivering “hot goods” in
commerce.  To establish “hot goods” for purposes of § 12(a), WH does not have
to show that a minor was engaged in the production of goods.  WH must only
demonstrate that a minor was illegally employed in or about the establishment
where the goods were produced within 30 days prior to the removal of the goods
from the establishment.  If 30 days pass after the CL violation, and no further
violations have occurred, the “hot goods” will have “cooled,” and shipment from
the establishment is permitted.  If the goods are removed before 30 days have
passed, the goods are permanently “hot”.  Finally, § 12(a) does not bar
shipment or sale of goods where the initial shipment does not occur until the
goods have “cooled”.</p><p>(3)  A producer, manufacturer, or dealer may “ship” goods
in commerce either by moving them itself in interstate or foreign commerce or
by causing them to move, such as by delivery to a carrier.  </p><p>a.    
A baker “ships” its bread in
commerce whether it carries it in its own truck across state lines or sends it
by contract or common carrier to its customers in other states. </p><p>b.    
A manufacturer delivers its goods
for shipment in commerce when it transports its goods in state to a distributor
who, as the manufacturer is well aware, will ship the goods into another
state.  For example, a paper box manufacturer who ships a carton of boxes to a
fresh fruit or vegetable packing shed within the same state, with knowledge or
reason to believe that the boxes will there be filled with fruits or vegetables
and shipped outside the state, has delivered the boxes for shipment in
commerce.</p><p>c.    
However, the word “ship” must be
applied in its ordinary meaning.  It does not apply to the transmission of
telegraphic messages, for example (see 29 CFR 570.106(a)).</p><p>(4)  Consideration must be given to both whether a minor is
employed “in” or employed “about” the establishment. </p><p>a.    
A minor who performs occupational
duties on the premises of the producing establishment is employed “in” that
establishment.  A minor is also employed “in” an establishment where the minor
performs most duties off the premises but is regularly required to perform
certain occupational duties in the establishment, such as loading or unloading
a truck.  This is true even though the minor is employed by someone other than
the owner or operator of the particular establishment. </p><p>b.    
However, a minor is not employed
“in” an establishment other than his or her employer's merely because such
establishment is visited by the minor for brief periods of time and for the
sole purpose of picking up or delivering a message or other small article.</p><p>c.    
If the minor cannot be considered
as employed “in” the establishment, he or she may, nevertheless, be employed
“about” it.  However, the minor must perform occupational duties sufficiently
close in proximity to the actual place of production to fall within the
commonly understood meaning of the term “about,” and the minor’s occupation
must be directly related to the activities carried on in the producing,
manufacturing or dealing establishment.  </p><p>1.    
For example, a driver's helper
employed to assist in the distribution of the products of a bottling company
who regularly boards the delivery truck immediately outside the premises of the
bottling plant is considered employed “in or about” such establishment, without
regard to whether he ever enters the plant itself. </p><p>2.    
On the other hand, employees
working entirely within one establishment are not considered to be employed “in
or about” a wholly different establishment occupying separate premises and
operated by another employer. This would be true even though the two
establishments are contiguous (see 29 CFR 570.110(b)).</p><p>(5)  Section 12(a) of the FLSA establishes a “good faith”
defense from the prohibition on shipping hot goods for a purchaser of these
goods who has acquired these goods for value, in good faith, without notice
that the goods were produced in violation of the FLSA, and in reliance on
written assurance from the producer that the goods were produced in compliance
with the FLSA.  </p><p>a.    
For example a wholesaler who
purchases goods in “good faith” from a producer, manufacturer, or dealer of
such goods, who in turn sells these goods in his retail establishment, would
have a “good faith” defense from the § 12(a) prohibitions.  </p><p>b.    
However, a person or firm that
owns the goods throughout the production process, even though some or all of
the production work is done by independent contractors, or subcontractors or
other producers of goods, cannot be a “purchaser in good faith” who is removed
from the “hot goods” provisions of § 12(a).  For example, a garment
manufacturer could not claim that it was a “purchaser in good faith”, if it
owns the product throughout the manufacturing process, even though the cutting,
sewing, and embroidery work was all performed by independent contractors,
contractors, and subcontractors.</p>

              <h3>33a03.   Distinction between §§ 12(a) and 12(c) coverage.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Coverage under § 12(c) is
dependent upon a minor being employed in commerce or in the production of goods
for commerce, or in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of
goods for commerce.  Section 12(c) coverage is based upon either the minor’s
performance of individually covered activities or employment in a covered
enterprise.  If such a minor is employed under these circumstances a violation
of § 12(c) would occur regardless of where he or she may be employed or what
his employer may do and regardless of whether there is a “removal” of goods or
a shipment or delivery for shipment in commerce.  </p><p>(b)  
Coverage under § 12(a) on the
other hand, often said to apply on an “establishment” basis, is dependent upon
the performance of duties in or about an establishment producing goods for commerce
rather than upon the nature of the work performed by the minor employee or by
the nature of the enterprise.  Section 12(a) coverage does not require that the
minor whose employment constitutes oppressive child labor be covered on an
enterprise or individual basis.  The provisions of § 12(a) would still apply in
a situation in which an under-age employee does not engage in the production of
goods themselves if somewhere in the establishment in or about which they are
employed goods are “produced” which are subsequently shipped or delivered for
shipment in commerce.  </p><p><b>(c)   </b>Section 12(a) does not directly exclude the employment
of oppressive CL.  Instead, it prohibits the shipment or delivery for shipment
in interstate or foreign commerce of goods produced in an establishment where
oppressive CL has been employed within thirty days before removal of the
goods.  Section 12(c), on the other hand, is a direct prohibition against the
employment of oppressive CL in commerce, or in the production of goods for commerce.

CL provisions of FLSA § 12, apply to domestic service employees only when such
employees are covered on an “individual” or “enterprise” basis, or if they are
employed in or about a home where homeworkers produce goods for commerce. 
Thus, unless such coverage exists, the prohibitions of § 12 do not apply. 
However, the MW and OT provisions of FLSA §§ 6(b) and 7(a)(1) are applicable,

Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may not

CFR 570.35(a) sets forth the conditions of employment in nonagricultural
occupations for 14- and 15-year-old minors, confining such employment to
periods and conditions that do not interfere with their schooling.</p><p>(a)  
CL Reg 3 limits the employment of
14- and 15-year-olds to periods that are:</p><p>(1)  Outside of school hours.</p><p>(2)  Not before 7:00 a.m.; and not after 7:00 p.m. (except
such youth may work until 9:00 p.m. between June 1 and Labor Day).  This means
that such minors may only work until 7:00 p.m. from the day after Labor Day
through May 31st.  These “end of day” hours standards are tied to
the calendar year, not the school year.</p><p>(3)  No more than 3 hours on a school day, including
Fridays, and no more than 18 hours in a week in which school is “in session.”. 
</p><p>(4)  No more than 8 hours on a nonschool day, and no more
than 40 hours in a week when school is not “in session.”  </p><p>(b)  
<b>School hours</b></p><p>(1)  School hours are determined by the local public school
in the area where the minor is residing while employed—this is true even if the
minor does not attend the public school (i.e., attends a private school, a
religious school, or is home schooled).  School hours refers to the hours
established by the school district during the regularly scheduled school year
and not the hours the individual child is required to attend (see
§ 570.35(b))</p><p>(2)  Special provisions apply to students participating in
a state sponsored Work Experience and Career Exploration Program authorized by
the Department of Labor in accordance with 29 CFR 570.36 or in school
sponsored Work-Study Program in accordance with 29 CFR 570.37 (see
FOH 33b02(c) and 33b02(d) for more information about these programs).</p><p>(c)  
<b>Outside school hours and school
hours</b></p><p>(1)  Outside school hours means such periods as before and
after school hours, holidays, summer vacations, weekends, and any other day or
part of a day when the local public school district where the minor resides
while employed is not in session.  </p><p>(2)  Because school hours are determined by the hours
established by the local public school district during the regularly scheduled
school year, summer school sessions are also considered to be “outside school
hours” for the purpose of applying the hours limitations of CL Reg 3. </p><p>(3)  In some instances a school may employ a student 14 or
15 years of age to work (for example, in the cafeteria) during the noon hour or
during a period when the student has no class.  For purposes of CL Reg 3 (§
570.35(a)(1)), such work will be considered as “outside school hours” (see
also FOH Chapter 10). </p><p>(4)  As discussed in FOH 33b02(b), § 570.35(c) creates
exceptions from certain CL Reg 3 hours limitations for certain 14- and
15-year-old minors.  </p><p>(5)  At one time, WH permitted enrollees in the “in school”
program of the Neighborhood Youth Corps (NYC) to work “during school hours” as
this term is used in CL Reg 3 under certain specified conditions.  Such youth
were limited to working no more than 8 hours per week.  The Employment and
Training Administration (ETA) has advised WH that the NYC ended in the early
1970s and all successor programs have required compliance with the federal
child labor provisions, including the hours standards of CL Reg 3. </p><p>(d)  
<b>Week defined</b></p><p>(1)  Week, as used in 29 CFR 570.35(a)(2) and (3), means a
regularly recurring period of 168 hours—seven consecutive 24-hour periods—that
is identical to the workweek that the employer establishes under 29 CFR
778.105.  Prior to July 19, 2010, the effective date of the 2010 Final Rule
published on May 20, 2010, the term week was defined as a standard calendar
week that commences at 12:01 a.m. Sunday and ends at midnight Saturday.</p><p><b>(2)  </b>Week when school is in session, as used in 29 CFR 570.35(a)(3), means

              <h3>33b02  . Partial exemptions impacting the CL Reg 3 hours
standards.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
<b>Professional sports attendants</b></p><p>29
CFR 570.35(c)(2) exempts from the hours standards of CL Reg 3 minors 14 and 15
years of age who are employed to perform sports-attending services at
professional sporting events provided they are employed outside of school hours
and perform only those sports-attending duties listed in that section.</p><p>(1)  Duties which are permitted include pre- and post-game
or practice setup of balls, items and equipment; supplying and retrieving
balls, items, and equipment during a sporting event; clearing the field or
court of debris, moisture, etc. during play; providing ice, drinks, towels,
etc., to players during play; running errands for trainers, managers, coaches,
and players before, during, and after a sporting event; and returning and/or
storing balls, items and equipment to club houses or locker rooms after
sporting events.</p><p>(2)  Duties which are not permitted include:  grounds or
field maintenance such as grass mowing, spreading or rolling tarpaulins used to
cover playing areas, etc.; cleaning and repairing equipment; cleaning locker
rooms, showers, lavatories, rest rooms, team vehicles, club houses, dugouts, or
similar facilities; loading and unloading balls, items, and equipment from team
vehicles before and after a sporting event; doing laundry; working in
concession stands or other selling and promotional activities; and performing
the duties of an umpire, referee, or other sports official.</p><p>(b)  
<b>High school graduates, children
excused from school on religious grounds, and expelled students</b></p><p>(1)  29 CFR 570.35(c)(1) provides exemptions from the CL
Reg 3 hours standards limitations contained in § 570.35(a)(1), (3), and
(5) for those 14- and 15-year-olds listed below who, for a variety of reasons,
do not or cannot attend school.  These exemptions, which stem from long
standing WH enforcement positions, were placed in the regulations by the Final
Rule published on May 20, 2010 (see 75 FR 28423).  </p><p>a.    
Minors who have graduated from
high school.</p><p>b.    
Minors who have been excused from
compulsory school attendance by the state or other jurisdiction once they have
completed the eighth grade if compliance is achieved with all the requirements
of the state school attendance law.  </p><p>c.    
Minors who are subject to an order
of a state or federal court prohibiting them from attending school. </p><p>d.    
Minors who have been permanently
expelled from school (not a temporary suspension) and are not required by state
or local law or ordinance or court order to attend another school.  </p><p>e.    
Minors who have a child to support
and appropriate state officers, pursuant to state law, have waived school
attendance standards for the minors.</p><p>(2)  The above minors, however, are subject to the
remaining conditions established by CL Reg 3, including the occupational
limitations and the provisions that permit them to work only between the hours
of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. (9:00 p.m. between June 1 and Labor Day).  </p><p>(3)  None of the exceptions listed in this section apply to
youth employed in agriculture.  The prohibition against the employment of youth
under 16 years of age in agriculture during the hours the local public school
is in session (except when employed by his or her parent on a farm owned or
operated by that parent) is statutory.  No exception from the prohibition
against employment during school hours, other than the parental exemption, is
provided by the FLSA for employment in agriculture.</p><p>(c)  
<b>Work Experience and Career
Exploration Program (WECEP)</b></p><p>(1)  29 CFR 570.36 provides for certain variations from CL
Reg 3 for minors 14 and 15 years of age who are enrolled in and employed
pursuant to a state Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP) that
has been approved by WH.  In order to qualify for such variations, a state
educational agency (normally the state Department of Education) must file a
letter of application with the WH Administrator for approval of a program
plan.  Individual schools or school districts may not apply for or be granted a
WECEP by WH; approval is granted only to the state government.  </p><p>a.    
After WH has authorized the state
program, records of the names and addresses of each school enrolling students
in the WECEP, as well as the number of students enrolled, must be kept at the state
educational office and made available for review in that office by WH
representatives.  Additionally, the state educational agency or the local
school must keep on file a copy of the written training agreement that is
required for each student participating in the WECEP.  These records must be
kept for a period of three years.  </p><p>b.    
A list of states that have been
authorized to operate a WECEP can be found at www.dol.gov/whd.</p><p>(2)  Hours of work for WECEP students</p><p>29
CFR 570.36(d) provides that students who are working under an approved WECEP
(including those employed in nonhazardous agricultural occupations) may be
employed for as many as 3 hours on any school day and 23 hours in any week
school is in session, any portion of which may be during school hours.  No
other changes, however, in the hours standards established by CL Reg 3 are
permitted and the standards will not be waived. </p><p>(3)  Occupations for WECEP students</p><p>a.    
29 CFR 570.36(c) prohibits WECEP
participants from being employed in the occupations of mining, manufacturing,
and those the Secretary of Labor has declared to be hazardous for the
employment of minors between the ages of 16 and 18 (the HOs).  This same
section provides for the employment of WECEP students in some occupations
otherwise prohibited under CL Reg 3 if a “variance” has been issued by the WH
Administrator.</p><p>b.    
Variances.  Before a student may
be employed in a prohibited occupation, the state educational agency must
submit a written request for a variance to the WH Administrator which outlines
all the steps the WECEP will take to ensure that the minor can safely perform
the work in question.  Information regarding the classroom and on-the-job
safety training, supervision, and personal protective equipment the youth will
receive must be detailed in the request. </p><p>1.    
WECEP variance approvals are
specific to the school operating the WECEP and the employer that employs the
student.  Variance approvals run concurrently with the WECEP approval period of
the state program (up to two years).  Variances are valid only during the
months school is in session for the WECEP participant.  The variances are not
valid during summer vacation periods.  </p><p>2.    
The most common occupations
covered by WECEP variance requests that have been approved by the NO on an
individual basis, include: </p><p>A.   
Cooking over electric and gas
grills that does not involve cooking with an open flame and cooking with deep
fat fryers.  Prior to February 14, 2005 when new CL Reg 3 cooking rules became
effective, these requests allowed WECEP participants to perform cooking duties
that were not “in plain view” of the customer.  After February 14, 2005, WH
will consider issuing, on a case by case basis, variances that allow WECEP
students to operate deep fat fryers that are not equipped with devices that
automatically raise and lower the baskets.</p><p>B.   
Unloading trucks at retail and
food service establishments.  The variance approvals issued by the National
Office impose limitations on the amount of weight that may be lifted and the
amount of time that may be spent performing this task.</p><p>C.   
Operating power-driven lawn mowers
(not riding mowers) and weed-eaters that use plastic “string” (not metal) to
cut vegetation.  Limitations on the amount of time WECEP participants may
perform these duties are detailed on the variance approvals.</p><p>D.   
Washing and cleaning of school
buses.  The variance approvals allow WECEP participants to work in garages and
“bus barns” but not to use power washing equipment, step ladders or ladders,
nor to work in “pits” when washing or cleaning buses.</p><p>(4)  Wage rates for WECEP students</p><p>WECEP
students generally must be paid the applicable MW rate (including a Youth
Minimum Wage where applicable).  Student-learner certificates cannot apply to
the employment of WECEP participants because, by definition, student-learners
must be at least 16 years of age (see 29 CFR 520.300).  Under certain
conditions, properly certified employers may pay WECEP participants less than
the applicable federal minimum wage as full-time students in accordance with
FLSA § 14(b) (see 29 CFR part 519).</p><p>(d)  
<b>Work-Study Program (WSP)</b></p><p>(1)  29 CFR 570.37 provides for certain variations from CL
Reg 3 for minors 14 and 15 years of age who are enrolled in and employed
pursuant to a Work-Study Program (WSP) that has been approved by WH.  In order
to qualify for such variations, the superintendent of the school attended by
the WSP candidate must first file with the WH Administrator a letter of
application for approval of the WSP.</p><p>(2)  The WSP is open only to youth enrolled in a college
preparatory curriculum.  A WSP student-participant must receive, every school
year he or she participates in the WSP, at least the minimum number of hours of
classroom instruction required to complete a fully-accredited college preparatory
curriculum (as determined by the State Educational Agency responsible for
establishing such standards).  Such classroom instruction shall include, every
year the youth participates in the WSP, training in workplace safety and state
and federal child labor provisions and rules.</p><p>(3)  Hours of work for WSP participants</p><p>a.    
Employment of student-participants
in the WSP authorized by § 570.37 will be confined to not more than 18 hours in
a week when school is in session, a portion of which may be during school hours
in accordance with the following formula that is based upon a continuous
four-week-cycle.</p><p>1.    
In three of the four weeks, the
participant is permitted to work during school hours on only one day per week,
and for no more than for eight hours on that day.</p><p>2.    
During the remaining week of the
four-week cycle, the WSP student-participant is permitted to work during school
hours on no more than two days, and for no more than for eight hours on each of
those two days.</p><p>b.    
The employment of WSP
student-participants must also comport with the time of day and number of hours
standards contained in §§ 570.35(a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(6).</p><p>c.    
The limitations on the number of
hours that participating students may be employed, as described in FOH
33b02(d)(3) above, constitute the absolute maximum number of hours that
participants may be employed.  </p><p>1.    
Participating schools and
employers may choose to adopt some other schedule of work hours that comports
with the established maxima—such as one four-hour day or one six-hour day each
workweek; or two eight-hour days each weekend; or three hours a day at the end
of each of three school days, as long as those hours comply with end-of-day
hours standards established by § 570.35(a)(6). </p><p>2.    
They are, however, prohibited from
allowing the same participant to work during school hours on more than one
school day in any school week—except every fourth week in the four-week cycle
when such youth may work during school hours on no more than two school days in
that week.</p><p>(4)  Occupations for WSP students  </p><p>a.    
WSP participants must be employed
in accordance with the provisions of §§ 570.33 and .34.</p><p>b.    
The WSP has no provisions for
special occupational variances like those found in WECEP.</p><p>(5)  Wage rates for WSP students  </p><p>a.    
WSP students generally must be
paid the applicable MW rate (including a Youth Minimum Wage where applicable). 
Student-learner certificates cannot apply to the employment of WSP participants
because, by definition, student-learners must be at least 16 years of age (see
29 CFR 520.300).  Under certain conditions, properly certified employers may
pay WSP participants less than the applicable federal MW as full-time students
in accordance with FLSA § 14(b) (see 29 CFR part 519). </p><p>b.    
Some WSP students may wish to
assign their wages to their school to defray the cost of the students'
educations.  WH will not take exception to such assignments as long as they
comport with the provisions of 29 CFR 531.40.</p><p>(e)  
Youth employed by a parent in a
business owned entirely by that parent are exempt from the CL Reg 3 hours
standards (see FOH 33e00).</p>

              <h3>33c00.   General.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
The FLSA generally prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in mining and manufacturing occupations and
those occupations the Secretary of Labor has declared to be hazardous for the
employment of minors between 16 and 18 years of age or detrimental to their
health or well-being (the Hazardous Occupations Orders).  </p><p>(b)  
In accordance with FLSA § 3(l),
nonexempt 14- and 15-year-olds may only be employed in those nonagricultural occupations
that the Secretary of Labor has determined do not interfere with their health
and well-being.  Occupations that are not specifically listed as permitted are
prohibited (see 29 CFR 570.32).  Such youth must also be employed in compliance
with the hours standards established by 29 CFR 570.35.  </p><p>(c)  
29 CFR 570.34 lists those jobs
that the Secretary of Labor has determined do not interfere with the health and
welfare of 14- and 15-year-olds.  These are the “permitted occupations.”</p><p>(1)  29 CFR 570.33 details examples of occupations in which
14- and 15-year-olds may not be employed.  This list is not exhaustive, but
reflects some of the more common areas of violation.  This list is provided to
add clarity to the list of permitted occupations detailed in 29 CFR 570.34.</p><p>(2)  The order in which the CL Reg 3 Occupational Standards
are presented in this Chapter follow, as nearly as possible, the order in which
each standard is presented or touched upon in 29 CFR 570.33 and
570.34.  In general, FOH 33c discusses the list of prohibited occupations
(§ 570.33) and the permitted occupations (§ 570.34) are discussed in
FOH 33d.  Because §§ 570.33 and 570.34 tend to reinforce and provide
clarity to each other, considerable overlap between FOH 33c and 33d is to be
expected.</p>

              <h3>33c01. Manufacturing, mining, and processing.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(a) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing, mining, or processing
occupations.  This section also prohibits the employment of such minors in
occupations which require the minors to perform any duties in work rooms or
work places where goods are manufactured, mined, or otherwise processed.  FLSA
§ 13(c)(7) provides an exemption from these requirements for certain youth who
may now be employed inside and outside of establishments where power-driven
machinery is used to process wood products (see FOH 33e06).</p><p>(b)  
The definitions of manufacturing
and processing contained in (e) and (f) below are intended for use only in
connection with the CL provisions of the FLSA.</p><p>(c)  
It is necessary to distinguish
between manufacturing and processing only when the parental exemption is
involved (see FOH 33c00).  The parental exemption contained in the
FLSA does not permit the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing or
mining, but does allow the employment of this age group by a parent in
processing occupations.</p><p>(d)  
Although CL Reg 3 generally
prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in processing occupations (29
CFR 570.33(a)), youth may perform certain named processing occupations that are
detailed in § 570.34.  </p><p>(e)  
<b>Manufacturing defined</b></p><p>The
term manufacturing means making anything from raw materials by
hand, or by machinery, or by art.  The process of manufacturing generally
involves the transformation of raw materials or semi-finished goods into new or
different articles.  The manufacturing process is not completed until the
article being manufactured has reached the form in which it will be available
to the ultimate consumer.  Any occupation involved in the manufacture of a
product from the assembling of the raw materials for manufacture to the
completion of the manufactured article is a part of the manufacturing process,
and, therefore, a manufacturing occupation.  All manufacturing is processing,
but not all processing is manufacturing.  The following are examples of
manufacturing within the meaning of CL Reg 3:  </p><p>(1)  Trimming and examining of items when performed as a
part of a manufacturing process.</p><p>(2)  Quality control and inspection of manufactured
products.  </p><p>(3)  Cleaning of a printing press and proofreading in a
print shop.  </p><p>(4)  Canning of fresh fruits or vegetables.  </p><p>(5)  The assembly of component parts into a finished
product away from the place where the component parts are manufactured is a
continuation of the manufacturing process, and is manufacturing.  </p><p>(6)  Assembling of box shook or crates in which goods are
to be packed, including making of the lid or cover, is a change in the raw
material from which the box or crate is made and constitutes “manufacturing”
whether done by hand or machine.  However, assembling light-weight flat-folded
cartons either by stapling with a hand stapler machine or by pasting with tape
is not manufacturing.  </p><p>(7)  “Lidding”—the operation of fastening down the cover on
the filled container—is manufacturing when it is accomplished by use of a
power-driven machine.  </p><p>(8)  Stitching of bags containing produce by means of
automatic electric sewing machines in fresh fruit and vegetable packing sheds
is manufacturing.  </p><p>(9)  The folding, pinning, and packaging for shipment of
newly manufactured apparel.</p><p>(10)  “Carding.”  If the article is sold to the consumer as a
packaged or carded article, as is often the case with jewelry or buttons, the
packaging or carding of the article into the form in which it is offered to the
public is considered an integral part of the manufacturing of the article when
the work is performed in the manufacturing establishment.</p><p>(f)  
<b>Processing defined</b></p><p>(1)  The term processing ordinarily is understood to convey
the idea of an operation in the course of which goods undergo a change in form
or substance.  Examples of processing within the meaning of CL Reg 3 are:  </p><p>a.    
Cleaning and filleting of fish,
freezing fresh shrimp, and the picking and packing of crabs.</p><p>b.    
Slaughtering of livestock.  </p><p>c.    
Dressing of poultry.  </p><p>d.    
Cracking of nuts. </p><p>e.    
Laundering, folding, hanging, and
pressing clean laundry; and the altering of clothes (whether performed in
commercial laundries or retail dry cleaners).  Except the washing and drying of
laundry performed in a coin-operated laundromat with home-type washer and dryer
machines is not considered processing if performed in a room separated from all
other processing. </p><p>f.     
Cutting or chipping of ice.  </p><p>g.    
Air drying or seasoning of
lumber.  </p><p>h.    
Repairing of motor vehicles,
changing tires and batteries.  </p><p>i.     
Placing of business records on
microfilm.  </p><p>j.     
Operations in connection with bulk
mailings including folding letters; addressing, stuffing, and sealing
envelopes; affixing postage; and bundling mailings.  </p><p>k.    
Painting of mine timbers; painting
and embossing objects.  </p><p>l.   
Developing of X-rays.</p><p>m.  
Development of film into
photographs, including the use of automated systems in retail stores.</p><p>n.    
The cutting of “mats” for
photographs, engravings, and artwork whether by hand, with a power-driven tool,
or a computerized automatic cutter.  </p><p>(2)  The following activities would not be manufacturing or
processing activities:</p><p>a.    
The trimming and shearing of
ordinary household-size Christmas trees with hand tools (i.e., not power-driven
equipment) does not constitute a “processing occupation” as the term is used in
CL Reg 3.  Therefore, minors 14 and 15 years of age may be employed in this
occupation in accordance with the other provisions of CL Reg 3.  In some
instances, occupations in connection with Christmas trees may be within the
definition of agriculture contained in FLSA § 3(f) (see
FOH 20b06); in such cases §§ 13(c)(1) and (2) apply. </p><p>b.    
The transfer of propane from large
pressurized tanks to smaller tanks of a lower pressure without the use of power
driven equipment is not considered processing.  Therefore, minors 14 and 15 years
of age are not be prohibited from performing this activity because it is not
considered processing.  The basic form of the propane gas is not altered when
it is transferred from the large pressurized tank to the smaller pressurized
tank.  </p><p>c.    
The packing of fresh fruits and
vegetables is not processing because the goods remain in their raw or natural
state.  Packing includes cleaning, washing, trimming, application of artificial
coloring, sorting, grading, tiering, wrapping, packaging and labeling packages
when these operations take place in conjunction with and as a part of the
packing of fresh fruits and vegetables. </p><p>d.    
The tagging and pricing of
clothing for sale in a retail used-clothing shop, when some of the clothing is
not salable and is returned to a central location for processing into rags or
sold for scrap, is not processing.  The mere sorting of clothing does not
change or alter the clothing.  </p><p>e.    
The stuffing of newspapers—that is
the placing of one section of newspaper inside another—when performed outside
the work rooms in which printing, manufacturing, or processing takes place, is
a distribution function rather than a manufacturing or processing function. 
Therefore, 14- and 15-year-old minors may be employed in such newspaper
stuffing, provided all the terms and conditions of CL Reg 3 are met.  This
applies also to other occupations in the newspaper industry further removed
from the manufacturing of the newspaper, such as bundling, tying up,
addressing, and other mailing room occupations, and to employment in a
wholesale house engaged in the distribution of newspapers and magazines. 
Prohibited processing would occur if the minors placed newspapers in plastic
bags and then “heat sealed” the bags for security reasons or to protect the
contents from the elements.</p>

              <h3>33c02. Occupations in work rooms.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Under CL Reg 3, 29 CFR 570.33(a),
minors may not generally be employed in a work room or work place where goods
are manufactured, mined or otherwise processed.  Goods, in this context, refers
to goods as defined in FLSA § 3(i).  </p><p>(b)  
The CL Reg 3 prohibition against
working in a work room or work place where goods are manufactured applies even
if the minor is engaged in work other than &quot;manufacturing, mining, or
processing.  The prohibition continues to apply even if the minor is working
during hours or days when the plant or establishment is closed and not in
operation. </p><p><b>Director
of Industrial Division Children's Bureau McConnell's letter of September 1,
1942</b>.  </p><p>(c)  
Work rooms where goods are
manufactured or processed include work centers and manufacturing operations of
Community Rehabilitation Programs (CRPs) that employ workers with disabilities
at special minimum wages under certificates issued in accordance with FLSA §
14(c).</p><p>(d)  
There are some exceptions to this
general prohibition against working in work rooms.</p><p>(1)  Children 14- and
15-years of age generally may not be employed in work rooms where manufacturing
or the processing of goods takes place, but they may be employed in
establishments at which such activities occur if they are working in a work
room or area separate from that in which the manufacturing or processing takes
place.  The work area must be separated from where the actual manufacturing or
process occurs by a wall or barrier.</p><p>a.    
The type of barrier between the
manufacturing or processing activities and the minors’ work place depends in
large measure upon the nature of the manufacturing or processing operation. 
The barrier must be sufficient in height, strength, and density to guard the
youth from exposure to the hazards presented by the manufacturing or processing
process.  A strong barrier of wire might be all that is necessary to constitute
a separate work room.  Ordinarily, a barrier at least seven feet high is
adequate.</p><p>b.    
There may be openings in the
partition, but they may not be wider than those made for an ordinary door, and
such openings should have doors if possible.  If dust or fumes are present,
however, a solid partition extending all the way from floor to ceiling may be
necessary.</p><p>(2)  Certain 14- and 15-year-olds may be employed inside
and outside of establishments that use power-driven machinery to process wood
products under specified conditions (FLSA § 13(c)(7)).  The provisions of this
limited exemption are discussed in detail in FOH 33e06.</p><p>(3)  Section 570.34 permits the employment of 14- and
15-year-olds in certain processing occupations; for example, limited cooking
tasks, office work such as photocopying, and hand polishing of cars and trucks
are permitted. </p>

              <p>(a)  
Section 3(l) of the FLSA, which
defines “oppressive child labor,” prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from
performing those occupations which the Secretary of Labor finds and declares to
be particularly hazardous for the employment of children between such ages or
detrimental to their health or well-being.  Under this authority, the Secretary
has issued 17 nonagricultural HOs.</p><p>(b)  
Although the HOs are written
specifically to regulate the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds, the
prohibitions established by the HOs are equally applicable to the employment of
14- and 15-year-olds because of CL Reg 3 (see 29 CFR 570.33(b)). 
This section incorporates into the list of occupations prohibited to 14- and
15-year-olds any occupation prohibited by an HO.</p><p>(c)  
CL Reg 3 and the HOs work together
to provide a safe work place for 14-and 15-year-olds.  Provisions in CL Reg 3
will not only overlap those of the HOs but will often be broader than those
contained in the HOs.  For example:</p><p>(1)  HO 2 prohibits minors from working as outside helpers
on motor vehicles; CL Reg 3 prohibits all work as helpers on motor vehicles.</p><p>(2)  HO 7 prohibits the operation, and in some cases
“assisting to operate,” power-driven hoisting equipment.  CL Reg 3 bans the
operation and the tending of all hoisting equipment, whether power-driven or
manually driven. </p><p>(3)  HO 11 prohibits the operation of certain power-driven
bakery machines.  CL Reg 3 bans all baking activities by 14- and 15-year-olds.</p>

              <h3>33c04. Operation of hoisting apparatus, including forklifts.</h3>
              <p>29
CFR 570.33(c) prohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from operating, tending,
setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing all hoisting apparatus. 
The term “hoist” refers to any apparatus for raising or lowering a load by the
application of a pulling force that does not include a car or platform running
in guides.  29 CFR 570.34(n) prohibits these same minors from performing
work using &quot;lifting apparatus&quot; in connection with automobiles and
trucks.</p><p>(a)  
The CL Reg 3 prohibition against
the operation of hoists is much broader than that of HO 7.  Under CL Reg 3,
unlike HO 7, prohibited hoists do not have to be power-driven but can rely on
mechanical or human power such as those that are operated by a “crank” or foot
pedal.</p><p>(1)  Under CL Reg 3, the term hoist includes all types of
hoists, such as base-mounted electric, clevis suspension, hook suspension,
monorail, overhead electric, simple drum and trolley suspension hoists.  </p><p>(2)  Under CL Reg 3, 14- and 15-year-olds are prohibited
from using most kinds of hoisting and lifting equipment, such as hydraulic “grease
rack” lifts used in gasoline service stations, tire stores and other
establishments servicing automobiles, as well as service racks and hand jacks,
even if that machinery did not fit within the definition of a hoist or lifting
apparatus, because Reg 3 does not explicitly permit the use of such equipment. 
See 29 CFR 570.32.</p><p>(b)  
<b>Forklifts</b>.  A forklift is a type of power-driven industrial
highlift truck used for lateral transportation.  It is equipped with a
power-operated device, usually in the form of a fork or platform, capable of
tiering loaded pallets or skids one above the other.  Minors 14- and
15-years-old may not operate or tend a forklift under CL Reg 3 because it is
both a hoist and a piece of power-driven machinery.  These CL Reg 3 prohibitions
also preclude 14- and 15-year-olds from riding on a forklift and working from a
forklift.</p><p>(c)  
<b>Dumbwaiters</b>.  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are generally prohibited
from operating any hoisting devices, but 29 CFR 570.34(i) permits such minors
to operate dumbwaiters when used to perform work involved with the preparing
and serving of food.  </p><p>(d)  
Minors 14 and 15 years of age
would also be prohibited from operating or tending those hoists found in large
retail stores that are designed to move individual shopping carts from one
floor to the next.  These devices, often constructed in conjunction with
escalators, are both power-driven machinery and hoisting machines.</p>

              <h3>33c05. Work performed in or about boiler or engine rooms, or in the
maintenance or repair of   the establishment, machines, or equipment.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(d) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in or about boiler or engine rooms and  in
connection with the maintenance and repair of the establishment, machines, or
equipment.  Maintenance would generally include the cleaning of such machines
or equipment.  </p><p>(b)  
CL Reg 3 includes certain
exceptions to the above maintenance (cleaning) prohibitions regarding kitchen
equipment and motor vehicles.</p><p>(1)  Kitchen Equipment.  29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and
15-year-olds to clean kitchen equipment (not otherwise prohibited by CL Reg 3
or the Hazardous Occupations Orders) under certain conditions. </p><p>a.    
Such minors may clean kitchen
equipment, remove oil or grease filters, pour oil or grease through filters,
and move receptacles containing hot grease or hot oil, but only when the
equipment surfaces, containers and liquids do not exceed a temperature of 100
°F.  </p><p>1.    
Questions have been raised as to
how compliance with this provision can be achieved and maintained—that the
temperature of equipment, surfaces, containers and liquids being cleaned,
filtered and/or transported do not exceed 100 °F (see 69 FR 75399, December 16,
2004).  </p><p>2.    
In some situations,
employer-installed thermometers could ensure that the required temperature has
been reached. </p><p>A.   
Cleaning schedules that
incorporate adequate “cooling down” periods, or that are executed before the
heating elements of the equipment are activated, can help ensure compliance
with this provision.</p><p>B.   
Clearly articulating policies that
require compliance to managers and other employees and monitoring can help
ensure compliance with this provision.</p><p>C.   
OSHA has advised WH that an individual
performing such cleaning functions would not normally experience a first degree
burn until the equipment, surfaces, containers and liquids being cleaned,
filtered and/or transported reached a temperature of at least 140 °F. 
Accordingly, it is WHD’s position that, generally, a violation of 29 CFR
570.34(i) has occurred whenever a covered 14- or 15-year-old employee received
at least a first degree burn while performing these named duties.  </p><p>b.    
CL Reg 3 does not prohibit a minor
from performing the normal grill “maintenance” that an employee routinely does
during the actual cooking process involving the use of water and a spatula to
scrape away and remove food particles and grease from the surface of the
grill.  This position applies only to electric and gas grills that do not
involve cooking with open flames (see 69 FR 75388, December 16, 2004).</p><p>(2)  Motor Vehicles.  29 CFR 570.34(n) permits 14- and
15-year-olds to perform work in connection with cars and trucks if confined to
the following:  dispensing gasoline and oil; courtesy services such as window
washing and checking oil levels; car cleaning, washing and polishing that is
done by hand; and other occupations permitted by CL Reg 3, but not
including work involving the use of pits, racks, or lifting apparatus, or
involving the inflation of any tire mounted on a rim equipped with a removable
retaining ring.  This exception does not allow 14- and 15-year-olds to operate
or maintain automatic car wash equipment or systems.</p>

              <h3>33c06  . Operation or tending of power-driven machines.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(e) generally
prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from occupations which involve the operating,
tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing of any
power-driven machinery other than office machines.  Exceptions to this general
prohibition are also provided for certain food service related equipment as per
29 CFR 570.34(c) and certain work in connection with cars and trucks as per
29 CFR 570.34(n).  </p><p>(b)  
The term power-driven machinery as
used by CL Reg 3 is very broad, and includes machines driven by electrical,
mechanical, water, or other power such as steam or hydraulic.  It also includes
battery-operated machines and tools but does not apply to machines or tools
driven exclusively by hand or foot power (see 75 FR 28408).  </p><p>(c)  
To emphasize the fact that CL Reg
3 prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from operating and tending almost all
power-driven equipment, § 570.33(e) lists particular pieces of equipment that
have historically been the source of child labor violations.  This list is
designed to provide clarity and is not exhaustive.</p><p>(d)  
Tending of power-driven machinery
is also interpreted broadly under CL Reg 3 and generally encompasses all
activities associated with the operation of such machinery, including but not
limited to: </p><p>(1)  Setting up, adjusting, cleaning, fueling, oiling,
maintaining, inspecting, transporting, and repairing such machinery. </p><p>(2)  Loading materials into the machinery and removing
materials from the machinery.  </p><p>(3)  Monitoring of machinery to ensure that it is operating
properly.  </p><p>(4)  Individuals who assist the operators of machinery—in
such matters as ensuring that there is a clear path of movement for the
machine, ensuring that the load the machine is carrying or transporting is
properly balanced or distributed, providing direction for the placement of a
load (as in the case of a forklift), and providing physical or verbal
assistance in the steering of machinery—would all be performing tending activities
under CL Reg 3.  </p><p>(5)  Tending includes assisting passengers on and off such
power-driven machinery as a ski lift, an amusement park ride, or a slide at a
water park (when water is pumped to the top of the slide).  </p><p>(e)  
The following are WH enforcement
positions relating to the operation and/or tending of certain pieces of
power-machinery.  A discussion regarding power-driven kitchen equipment and
food processing equipment is contained in FOH 33c12.</p>(1) 
Vacuum
cleaners and floor waxers.  In addition to certain office machines (see
FOH 33d01) and kitchen equipment (see FOH 33c12), CL Reg
3 permits 14- and 15-year-olds to operate vacuum cleaners and floor waxers (see
29 CFR 570.34(h)).  <p>a.    
The term floor waxers refers to
those combination or multipurpose floor care machines designed to strip wax
from floors, reapply wax, and buff or polish floors.  Such machines, also
called buffers, burnishers, and polishers, consist of a motor housed above a
circular rotating horizontal surface to which various pads or brushes may be
attached, depending upon the task to be performed.  The operator directs the
movement of the machine using a handle that rises perpendicular to the base of
the machine.</p><p>b.    
The term floor waxers does not
include the above described machines when used to sand or refinish floors, as
such equipment would generally be prohibited under HO 5 (Occupations involved
in the operation of power-driven wood-working machines).  In addition, CL Reg 3
prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in processing and construction
occupations.</p><p>c.    
The term floor waxers does not
include any floor stripper, cleaner, scrubber, burnisher or polisher upon which
the operator may ride while operating the machine.</p><p>(2)  Power-driven mowers.  29 CFR 570.33(e) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations involving the operating or
tending of power-driven machinery, and specifically names lawn mowers. 
Furthermore, Hazardous Occupations Order 2 (HO 2) would prohibit anyone under
the age of 18 from operating a riding lawn mower when used as a means of
transportation on public roads or highways (see FOH 33h02(e)(3)).</p>(3) 
Cutters,
including weed trimmers and “weed eaters”.  The prohibitions of 29 CFR
570.33(e) include operating or tending power-driven “cutters” such as weed
trimmers, “weed eaters,” and hedge trimmers.<p>(4)  Golf carts and all terrain vehicles (ATVs).  29 CFR
570.33(e) prohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from operating or tending
power-driven machinery, including golf carts and ATVs. 
29 CFR 570.33(f) prohibits these same minors from being employed in
occupations involving the operation of motor vehicles.  As golf carts and ATV’s
are power-driven machines that are also motor vehicles, no one under 16 years
of age may operate or tend such machines.</p><p>a.    
These CL Reg 3 prohibitions are
much broader than those of HO 2.  The CL Reg 3 prohibitions are not restricted
to the operation of the motor vehicle on “public roads or highways.”  </p><p>b.    
The operation of a golf cart or an
ATV would also be prohibited under HO 2 if the minor were operating the vehicle
as a means of transportation on a public road or highway (see FOH
33e02c(2)(b)).</p>(5) 
“Cart
Caddy” and “QuicKART”.  29 CFR 507.33(e) prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from
operating or tending power-driven machinery.  This would include the “Cart
Caddy,” “QuicKART,” and similar pieces of equipment.<p>a.    
The “Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART”
are two types of power-driven machines often used by grocers and other retail
stores to move large strings of shopping carts.  These machines are hooked to
the last shopping cart in a string and then the operator guides the string of
carts back to the store while commanding the machine to move by means of a
hand-held remote control.  The operator walks behind the machine and operates
the manual throttle when returning to the parking lot to collect more carts.  </p><p>b.    
As these machines are not
considered to be “motor vehicles” as defined in HO 2, they do not fall within
the scope of HO 2.  Sixteen- and 17-year-old minors are permitted to operate
these machines (see FOH 33h02(e)(2)).</p>(6) 
Office
machines.  29 CFR 570.33(e) and 570.34(a) permit 14- and 15-year-old minors to
operate office machines.  Office machines that may be operated by 14- and
15-year-old minors include computers, typewriters, electric staplers, printers,
copiers, cash registers, pencil sharpeners, automatic letter openers, adding
machines and calculators, postage machines, automatic filing systems, VCRs, and
digital cameras.  <p>(7)  Paper shredders.  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may
operate “office type” paper shredders in an office setting as part of “office
work.”  CL Reg 3 prohibits such youth from operating paper shredders in an
industrial or recycling setting. </p>(8) 
Amusement
park and water park rides.  The CL Reg 3 general prohibition against the
operation and tending of power-driven machinery includes the operating or
tending of all power-driven amusement park and water amusement park rides.  a.    
Tending
would include such duties as assisting riders as they enter and leave the ride,
checking to ensure seat belts are properly fastened, and policing the area to
ensure the ride is operated safely.b.    
These
prohibitions extend to most power-driven rides and attractions at water parks
as well.  29 CFR 570.34(l)(1) specifically prohibits all minors under 16 years
of age from working as dispatchers at the top of elevated water slides (see
FOH 33d06(d)(2)).  Note that certain activities may be performed by
properly certified 15 year old lifeguards at traditional swimming pools and
water amusement parks (including such water park facilities as wave pools, lazy
rivers, specialized activity areas that may include water falls and sprinkler
areas, and at the receiving or splashdown areas of the elevated water slides
(see 29 CFR 570.34(l)(1); see also  FOH  33d06).<p>WHD
FLSA Non-Administrator Letter January 17, 2006</p><p>c.    
In addition, 29 CFR 570.33(f)
prohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from operating a motor vehicle or serving
as helpers on such vehicles.  Some amusement park rides or equipment, such as
go-carts, coaches, and equipment used in daily parades, meet the definition of
motor vehicles (for purposes of Reg. 3, WHD uses the definition of motor
vehicle from HO 2, 29 CFR 570.52(c)(1)).  </p><p>d.    
29 CFR 570.33(n)(1) prohibits 14-
and 15-year-olds from performing occupations in connection with the
transportation of persons or property by rail, highway, air, water, pipeline or
other means.  Some amusement park rides, such as boats, paddle boats, “swan
rides,” ferries, and railroads, fall within this prohibition.</p><p>e.    
The operation of amusement park
rides is not prohibited for 16- and 17-year-old minors under Hazardous
Occupations Order 7 (HO 7).  Although a number of rides in amusement and theme
parks have characteristics similar to certain machines that minors are
prohibited from operating under HO 7, they are not derricks,
cranes, hoists, elevators, or manlifts
as defined by the HO (see FOH 33h07(c)).</p><p>(9) 
Conveyors.  See FOH
33c17.</p>(10) 
Automatic
elevators.  CL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from operating “automatic”
freight elevators and automatic combined passenger/freight elevators.  Such
youth may operate and ride in fully automatic passenger elevators as found in
most office buildings.  See FOH 33h07.

              <h3>33c07. Motor vehicles and service as helpers.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(f) prohibits 14- and
15-year-olds from occupations involving the operation of motor vehicles or
serving as helpers on such vehicles.  This same section prohibits such youth
from riding on a motor vehicle, inside or outside of an enclosed passenger
compartment, except as permitted by § 570.34(o) (see FOH 33c07(d)).  In
addition, 29 CFR 570.33(k) prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from loading and
unloading goods or property to and from motor vehicles, railroad cars, or
conveyors, except for those hand tools, personal protective equipment and
personal items specifically permitted by § 570.34(k).  </p><p>(b)  
The term motor vehicle, defined in
29 CFR 570.52(c)(1), means any automobile, truck, truck-tractor, trailer,
semitrailer, motorcycle, or similar vehicle propelled or drawn by mechanical
power and designed for use as a means of transportation but does not include
any vehicle operated exclusively on rails.</p><p>(1)  A motor vehicle does not have to be designed for use on
public roads, or actually be used on public roads, to fall within the
prohibitions of CL Reg 3.  This differs from the prohibitions of HO 2 (see
29 CFR 570.52).  </p><p>(2)  In addition to the examples listed in 29 CFR
570.52(c)(1), WH has made the following determinations regarding the definition
of a motor vehicle under 29 CFR part 570: </p><p>a.    
Power-driven golf carts and all
terrain vehicles (ATVs) are motor vehicles (see 75 FR 28408, see
also FOH 33h02(3)).  The “Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART,” two types of machines
often used by grocers and other retail stores to move large strings of shopping
carts, are not considered to be motor vehicles under 29 CFR part
570 (see FOH  33h07(c)(5) and  33c06(e)(5)).</p><p>b.    
Certain amusement park rides or
equipment, such as go-carts, parade vehicles, and coaches, are motor vehicles
as defined by 29 CFR 570.52(c) (see FOH 33c06(e)(8)).  </p><p>(c)  
The term motor vehicle helper is
not defined in CL Reg 3.  Reg 3 prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from “service as
helpers on such vehicles”.  This provision has been included in CL Reg 3,
without change, since the inception of the regulations as a temporary rule in
1938.  WH’s interpretation of the term motor vehicle helper has evolved over
the years and was influenced by the definition of outside helper contained in
HO 2 (see 29 CFR 570.52(c)).</p><p>(1)  For purposes of CL Reg 3, WH considers a helper on a
motor vehicle to be one whose employment assists in the operation of a motor
vehicle used in the transportation or delivery of persons or property.  Duties
may include assisting in the pick-up and/or delivery of people or property, the
loading or unloading of the vehicle, shifting property around the vehicle,
assisting the driver of the vehicle or other helpers on motor vehicles.  </p><p>(2)  A helper on a motor vehicle does not have to
ultimately ride as a passenger, either inside or outside of the vehicle, to be
considered a helper under CL Reg 3.  But the mere fact that a minor rides as a
passenger on a vehicle during working hours does not make that minor a “helper”
under CL Reg 3.</p><p>a.    
Section 570.34(k) permits 14- and
15-year-olds to load onto and unload from motor vehicles the light, personal,
non-powered hand tools, personal protective equipment, and other personal items
that they will use as part of their employment under certain conditions (see
FOH 33d05).</p><p>b.    
Youth peddling and door-to-door
salespersons as motor vehicle helpers</p><p>1.    
Section 570.33(j) prohibits the
employment of minors under 16 years of age in youth peddling or as door-to-door
salespersons—selling such things as candy, greeting cards, calendars, etc. 
Youth peddlers often perform motor vehicle helper duties prohibited by CL Reg 3
(see FOH 33c07(c)(2)b.).</p><p>2.    
Minors who are illegally employed
as youth peddlers often do more than simply ride in the crew leader’s van or
automobile while being transported to the sales areas—they often facilitate the
sales operations by performing such activities as sorting merchandise and
packing peddler’s kits while in transit, or loading and unloading the
merchandise being sold.  When performing these tasks, the youth peddlers are
also engaged as helpers on a motor vehicle under CL Reg 3.</p><p>3.    
Minors who merely ride in the crew
leader’s vehicle and perform no activities that facilitate the movement of the
persons or property being transported would not be considered to be helpers on
a motor vehicle under CL Reg 3.</p><p><b>(d)  </b><b>Riding as a passenger on motor vehicles</b></p><p>(1)  29 CFR 570.34(o) permits 14- and 15-year-olds to ride
inside passenger compartments of motor vehicles when:</p><p>a.    
They are not the operator of the
vehicle,</p><p>b.    
They are not serving as a helper
on the vehicle,</p><p>c.    
A significant reason for them
being a passenger in the vehicle is not to perform work in connection with
transporting, or assisting in the transporting, of other persons or property,</p><p>d.    
Each minor riding in the passenger
compartment must have his or her own seat, each seat must be equipped with a
seat belt or similar restraining device, and the employer must instruct the
minors that such belts or other devices must be used.  This requirement is similar
to those contained in FLSA § 13(c)(6) and 29 CFR 570.52(b) (see FOH
33h02(d)(1)), and</p><p>e.    
Each driver transporting the young
workers must hold a State driver’s license valid for the type of driving
involved and, if the driver is under the age of 18, his or her employment must
comply with the provisions of § 570.52.</p><p>(2)  Should any of the requirements detailed in FOH
33c07(d)(1) not be met, a violation of CL Reg 3 has most likely occurred.</p>

scaffolds, or their substitutes.  This prohibition is not just confined to
tasks involved with outside window washing.</p><p>(b)  
Although CL Reg 3 does not define
the term ladder, regulations issued by DOL’s Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) do.  WH relies upon this definition when enforcing the
child labor provisions of the FLSA. </p><p>(c)  
WHD FLSA Opinion Letter September
2, 2003</p><p>(d)  
Under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.21(c)(1), a
ladder is “an appliance usually consisting of two side rails joined at regular
intervals by cross-pieces called steps, rungs, or cleats, on which a person may
step in ascending or descending.”  </p><p>(e)  
Under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.21(c)(2), a
stepladder means “a self-supporting portable ladder, nonadjustable in length,
having flat steps and a hinged back.  Its size is designated by the overall
length of the ladder measured along the front edge of the side rails.”</p><p>(f)  
Section 570.34(l)(2) permits
properly certified 15-year-olds who are employed as lifeguards to use a ladder
to access and descend from the lifeguard chair (see FOH 33d06(c)(10)).</p><p>(g)  
WH has adopted an enforcement
position that permits 14- and- 15-year-olds who are otherwise employed in

Under CL Reg 3, baking is a
“process” and prohibited activities include such things as the weighing,
measuring, and mixing of ingredients; placing or assembling products in pans or
on trays; operating ovens (including placing items in ovens and removing items
from ovens); placing items on cooling trays or racks; and finishing or icing
baked products (see 69 FR 75383, December 16, 2004, for more
information). </p><p>(2)          
This prohibition on performing
activities that are steps in the baking process precludes 14- and 15-year-olds
from assembling pizzas just prior to baking.  This is true even if older workers
will actually place the pizzas in the ovens and remove them from the ovens.</p><p>(b)           
The ban on baking precludes 14-
and 15-year-olds from operating almost all ovens, including convection ovens,
microwave ovens (except those used for warming foods as described in
FOH 33c10(b)(2), below), pizza ovens, automatic feeding ovens, and high
speed ovens.</p><p>(1)          
High speed ovens.  Fourteen and
fifteen year olds are prohibited from cooking or baking with high speed ovens
that operate using a combination of high speed air impingement, infrared
browning elements, microwaves, and catalytic converters.  These ovens, which
can operate at temperatures of 500 °F, can quickly cook a wide variety of food
items.</p><p>a.             
These ovens, including models
manufactured by TurboChef called the Tornado, the C3, and the High h Batch, are
often used by quick service restaurants to bake or “toast” submarine sandwiches
and pizzas.</p><p>b.             
Such equipment may not be
considered a “toaster” that would be permitted under 29 CFR 570.34(i) (see FOH
33c12(b)(2)).</p><p>c.             
Enforcement experience indicates
that these high speed ovens are used in a variety of food service
establishments, hotels and theaters.  </p><p>(2)          
Microwave ovens.  Fourteen- and
15-year-olds may operate microwave ovens that, in accordance with § 570.34(i),
are used only to warm prepared food and do not have the capacity to work above
140 °F.</p>

              <h3>33c11. Cooking.</h3>
              <p>(a)           
29 CFR 570.33(h) generally
prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from performing any cooking except that which is
permitted by § 570.34(c).</p><p>(b)           
Such minors may cook with electric
and gas grills that do not involve cooking over an open flame (see §
570.34(c)).</p><p>(1)          
The cooking surface of the grill
must be solid to ensure the minors do not cook over an open flame.  These
provisions preclude 14- and 15-year-olds from cooking over charcoal flames,
open fires, and those gas and electric grills that do not utilize a “solid
slab” cooking surface.  </p><p>(2)          
Some electric and gas grills have
solid cooking surfaces on top, but are also equipped with a broiler under the
grill that takes advantage of the single source of heat (electric element or
gas flame).  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may cook with such grills but may not
use the broilers.</p><p>(c)           
The regulations (see § 570.34(c))
also specifically mention that such minors may not cook with such equipment as
rotisseries, broilers, pressurized equipment including fryolators, and cooking
devices that operate at extremely high temperatures such as “Neico broilers” (see
FOH 33c12(b)(3)).  </p><p>(d)           
Such minors may cook with deep
fryers that are equipped with and utilize a device which automatically lowers
the baskets into the hot oil or grease and automatically raises the baskets
from the hot oil or grease (see § 570.34(c)). </p><p>(1)          
The regulations require that the
product being deep fried be contained in a “basket” during the frying process. 
Therefore, 14- and 15-year-olds could not be employed to deep fry products that
are placed into and removed from the hot fat or grease via some other utensil
(tongs, fork, stick, etc.).</p><p>(2)          
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may not
manually operate (raise or lower) such baskets.   </p><p>(3)          
On February 14, 2005, a final rule
revising portions of 29 CFR part 570 became effective.  This rule, among other
things, established the types of cooking duties that 14- and 15-year-olds may
legally perform as discussed above.  Prior to February 14, 2005, such minors
could cook only at soda fountains, lunch counters, snack bars, or cafeteria
serving lines.  WH interpreted this provision to mean that all cooking by this
age group had to be performed “in plain view” of the customer.  The “in plain
view” rule ended effective February 14, 2005.</p><p>(4)          
The rules concerning the cleaning
of kitchen equipment by 14- and 15-year-olds are discussed in
FOH 33d04(e).</p>

              <p>(a)  
Although <a name="OLE_LINK4"></a><a name="OLE_LINK3">29 CFR 570.33(h</a>) prohibits minors 14 and 15 years of age
from performing most cooking tasks, § 570.34(i) permits such minors to perform
occupations involved in preparing and serving food and beverages, including
operating machines used to perform such work.  Machines such youth are
permitted to operate include, but are not limited to:</p><p>(1)  Electric and gas grills that do not involve cooking
the product over an open flame,</p><p>(2)  Deep fryers that utilize baskets to contain the food
product being cooked and which are equipped with and utilize a device that
automatically lowers the basket into the hot oil or grease and automatically
raises the basket out of the hot oil or grease,</p><p>(3)  Dishwashers,</p><p>(4)  Toasters (see FOH 33c12(b)(2)),</p><p>(5)  Dumbwaiters if limited to kitchen work involving the
preparation and serving of food,</p><p>(6)  Popcorn poppers,</p><p>(7)  Milk shake blenders, including blenders used to make
“smoothies,” frapuccinos, and fruit drinks,</p><p>(8)  Coffee grinders,</p><p>(9)  Automatic coffee machines, including espresso and
cappuccino machines (see 75 FR 28409),</p><p>(10)  Devices used to maintain the temperature of prepared
foods, such as warmers, steam tables, and heat lamps (even if the temperature
exceeds 140 °F),</p><p>(11)  Microwave ovens that are used only to warm prepared
food and do not have the capacity to warm above 140 °F,</p><p>(12)  Cotton candy machines (see FOH
33c12(b)(6)), and</p><p>(13)  “Sno Cone,” “Snow Cone,” and Italian ice machines (see
FOH 33c12(b)(9)).</p><p>(b)  
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are
prohibited from operating many other pieces of power-driven equipment used in
kitchens and food service establishments.  Below are specific pieces of
power-driven kitchen equipment that are cited in the regulations or upon which
WH has formally opined.</p><p>(1)  Toasters.  29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and
15-year-old minors to operate certain machines, including toasters.  </p><p>a.    
WH has long interpreted the term
toaster to mean that type of equipment that was generally found in snack bars
and lunch counters when CL Reg 3 was issued and used to toast such items as
slices of bread and English muffins.  This includes such equipment as the two-
or four-slice “pop-up” toasters similar to those manufactured for home use and
the small conveyor-type bread toasters now often found at self-service
breakfast buffets (see 75 FR 28409).  </p><p>b.    
Broilers, automatic broiler
systems, high speed ovens, and rapid toaster machines used at quick service
restaurants to toast such items as buns, bagels, and muffins—all of which
operate at high temperatures, often in excess of 500 degrees Fahrenheit—are not
toasters under CL Reg 3 and minors must be at least 16 years of age to operate
them (see 75 FR 28409).  One rapid toaster that 14- and 15-year-olds are not
permitted to operate is the Model VCT-200. </p><p>(2)  Broilers, including Automatic Broiler Systems  </p><p>a.    
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are
prohibited from performing all baking activities, including operating most
ovens, and from cooking with all broilers.  Some electric and gas grills that
have solid cooking surfaces on top, are also equipped with a broiler under the
grill that takes advantage of the single source of heat (electric element or
gas flame).  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may cook with such grills, but may not
use the broilers.</p><p>b.    
Automatic Broiler Systems (see
29 CFR 570.34(c)).  Fourteen and fifteen year olds are prohibited from
operating automatic broilers and cooking systems, such as those produced by the
Neico Automatic Broilers.  NEICO broilers – also called Flexi-Chef® Cooking
Systems – and other automatic broiler systems use a combination of convection
and radiant heat to flame broil a wide variety of items.  These items include
ribs, chicken, steak, hamburgers, seafood, nachos, vegetables and breadsticks. 
Automatic broilers, which can be powered by electric, natural gas, or propane,
often operate at temperatures in excess of 500 °F.  </p><p>1.    
Automatic broilers may operate
using a conveyor or system of conveyors.  The product is simply placed on the
conveyor at the feed-end and it flows through to the discharge-end, flame
broiled on both sides at the same time.  </p><p>2.    
On some systems, called
return-flow broilers, the product is both fed and returned on the same end of
the broiler.  Some automatic broilers also feature up to four independently
timed conveyor belts, allowing the user to broil up to four separate items at
the same time.  The broilers may also have a “meat holding unit” for limited
product holding after broiling and a “bun-grill” for toasting buns.  </p><p>3.    
Enforcement experience indicates
that these automatic broilers are used in a variety of food service
establishments. </p><p>(3)  Rotisseries (see 29 CFR 570.34(c)).  A
rotisserie is a device that cooks food while it slowly rotates.  Heating
sources may be electricity, gas, charcoal, or wood.  A rotisserie contains a
spit fitted with a pair of prongs that slide along its length. Food (usually
meat) is impaled on the spit and the prongs (which are inserted on each side of
the food) are screwed tightly into place to hold the food securely. Modern
rotisseries have a motor that automatically turns the shaft, while their
predecessors relied on human power.  </p><p>a.    
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are
prohibited from cooking with rotisseries.  </p><p>b.    
Not included in the CL Reg 3
prohibition regarding the operation of rotisseries would be those pieces of
equipment, often used at movie theaters, amusement parks, and snack bars, that
heat and maintain the temperature of pre-cooked hot dogs and sausages.  Such
permitted pieces of equipment include “roller grills” consisting of a
horizontal surface composed of a series or rotating cylinders upon which the
hot dogs are heated and “rotisserie cabinets” where the hot dogs are placed on
“spikes” or “cradles” and then “orbit” around or past a heat source.</p><p>(4)  Power-driven food slicers, grinders, choppers, and
mixers </p><p>29
CFR 570.33(e) prohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from performing occupations
which involve operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or
repairing power-driven food slicers and grinders, food choppers, food
processors, food cutters, and food mixers.  </p><p>a.    
These occupations are prohibited
under CL Reg 3 regardless of the material being processed by such machines. 
This prohibition is much broader than that contained in HO 10 (see 75 FR
28409).</p><p>b.    
Power-driven bagel slicers are
food slicers under CL Reg 3 and are therefore prohibited.  This prohibition is
much broader than that contained in HO 14 and the enforcement position
discussed in FOH 33h11(e).</p><p>c.    
Bakery-type mixers </p><p>1.    
CL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and
15-year-olds from operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling,
or repairing power-driven food mixers regardless of the product being
processed, the size of the mixer, or the blade or attachment being used.  This
prohibition is much broader than that imposed by HO 11, Occupations involved in
the operation of bakery machines.</p><p>2.    
Although HO 11 (see 29 CFR
570.62(b)(1)) provides an exception that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to operate
certain lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top power-driven food
mixers, this exception does not apply to those under 16 years of age (see
FOH 33h11(d)(2)d).  </p><p>d.    
Dairy Queen Blizzard Flavor Treat
Machine/Whisper Quiet Mix-N-Blend Machine  </p><p>The
“Blizzard,” a trademarked product of Dairy Queen, is made from soft ice cream. 
Although somewhat similar to a milk shake, the Blizzard is very thick and
cannot be poured.  The customer selects ingredients, such as chocolate, fruit,
or different kinds of candy, to be added to the soft ice cream.  All the
ingredients are placed in a cup and then blended or mixed by the Blizzard
machine.  Because these machines act as a milk shake blender, a machine
specifically permitted by 29 CFR 570.34(i), 14- and 15-year-olds may
operate both the Dairy Queen Blizzard Flavor Treat machine or the Whisper Quiet
Mix-N-Blend Machine.  </p><p>(5)  Cotton candy machines.  CL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14-
and 15-year-olds from operating most standard cotton candy machines.</p><p>a.    
The operator of the cotton candy
machine puts sugar crystals into a cylinder in the center of the machine.  The
sugar crystals are heated by hot air from an enclosed element to a soft liquid
consistency.  The liquid sugar is then spun out into a fluff that collects
within the bowl of the machine.  The operator takes a cardboard cone and twirls
it around just inside the surface of the bowl picking up the spun cotton candy
until the cone is filled to a serving size.  </p><p>b.    
29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and
15-year-old-minors to perform kitchen work and other work involved in preparing
and serving food and beverages, including the operation of machines and devices
used in the performance of such work, such as but not limited to, dishwashers,
toasters, dumbwaiters, popcorn poppers, milk shake blenders, and coffee
grinders.</p><p>1.    
Most cotton candy machines are
designed in such a manner to present few hazards to the operator, and the
operator is exposed to none of the moving parts of the machine.  </p><p>2.    
This machine operates in a fashion
similar to a popcorn popper, which is a permitted piece of equipment.</p><p>(6)  Waffle irons</p><p>a.    
CL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14- and
15-year-olds from cooking with electric waffle irons, including those used in
restaurants and ice cream shops to make “waffle cones.”  These waffle irons are
similar to electric grills, with solid heating elements powered by
electricity.  They do not involve cooking over an open flame, do not operate at
extremely high temperatures, and their operation does not constitute “baking”
under 29 CFR 570.33(h).</p><p>b.    
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may
also clean such waffle irons as long as the equipment and surfaces do not
exceed a temperature of 100 °F (see 29 CFR 570.34(i)). </p><p>(7)  Two-sided grills</p><p>a.    
CL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14- and
15-year-olds from cooking with electric or gas two-sided grills such as those
manufactured by Garland Commercial Industries under the name Master Series
Xpress Grills.  This equipment consists of a standard gas or electric grill
that is equipped with electric platen heaters that can be lowered
(automatically or manually) onto the food product to allow for two-sided
cooking.  Such equipment operates similar to a waffle iron.</p><p>b.    
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may
also clean such two-sided grills as long as the equipment and surfaces do not
exceed a temperature of 100 °F (see 29 CFR 570.34(i)). </p><p>(8)  Ice chippers, grinders and shavers</p><p>a.    
CL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and
15-year-olds from operating and tending most power-driven machinery used to
grind or shave ice.  Such machines are often used in restaurants, grocery
stores, concession stands, amusement parks, and industrial settings to process
ice.  They range greatly in size, horsepower, and the amount of ice they can
process per hour.</p><p>b.    
“Sno Cone,” “Snow Cone,” and
“Italian Ice” Machines </p><p>1.    
WH will not, however, assert a
violation of CL Reg 3 when 14- and 15-year-olds operate ice grinders and
shavers that are designed and used to produce “sno cones,” “snow cones,” and
“Italian ice”—products that consist of a single serving of ice which is then covered
with flavored syrup.  These machines are designed in such a manner to present
few hazards to the operator, and it appears that the operator is exposed to
none of the moving parts of the machine.  </p><p>2.    
Machines included under this
enforcement position are often found at concession stands at parks, theaters,
swimming pools, fairs, and other amusement venues.  The machines may be free
standing units, table top units, or contained in specially constructed
snow-cone carts.  </p><p>3.    
Ice grinding and shaving machines
included under this enforcement position may be electric, gas, or battery
operated, but the horsepower of the motors may not exceed ½ horsepower.  The
maximum output of such machines may not exceed 500 pounds of “snow” per hour.</p><p>4.    
WH will not charge a violation
when 14- and 15-year-olds operate the ice grinding and shaving equipment
described in this subsection.  They may also perform limited tending functions
such as loading ice into the machine, cleaning the exterior of the machine, and
cleaning the compartment that holds the crushed or shaved ice.  Such youth may
not assemble or disassemble the machine or perform any work that entails
contact with moving parts that grind or shave the ice.</p><p>5.    
Manufacturers whose equipment have
been found to meet the requirements of this enforcement position include
SnoKonette models 1002, 1003, 1203, 1803, and 1903; Paragon models PA-6133110,
PA-6133210, and PA-6133410; Echols models GWP-1360, GWP-117, GWP-103, and
GWP-123. </p>

for sale.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(i) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in work in freezers and meat coolers.  These
same regulations ban most work in the preparation of meat for sale.</p><p>(b)  
For example, minors would be
prohibited from working as dairy stock clerks handling ice cream, meat clerks,
deli clerks, or frozen-food stock clerks, where their duties would require them
to enter and remain in meat coolers or freezers for prolonged periods of time. 
CL Reg 3 also prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from taking inventory or
performing cleanup work which would require the minors to remain in the freezer
or meat cooler for extended periods of time (see 75 FR 28411-12).  </p><p>(1)  A meat cooler for purposes of 29 CFR 570.33(i), is any
confined, refrigerated area within a retail or food service establishment where
meat products are received, cut, trimmed, or otherwise processed, stored and
handled.  A meat cooler will often contain equipment such as band saws, meat
grinders, slicers, and other dangerous power-driven machinery.  It may also
have conveyor systems to move products and a “wrapping station” to package
products.</p><p>(2)  Not included in the definition of a meat cooler are
those coolers that are used merely to store items such as beverages, produce,
dairy products, and/or prepackaged meat products such as hot dogs, luncheon
meats or bacon.  </p><p>(3)  Also not included in the definition of meat cooler are
those refrigerated rooms – often found in convenience stores and located
directly behind and attached to sales cases – from which employees can
replenish stocks of beverages, dairy products (non-frozen), and prepackaged
meat products.  </p><p>(c)  
Fourteen- and 15-year-old
employees may occasionally enter freezers only momentarily to retrieve items
(see 29 CFR 570.34(i)).  For example, a minor who works in an ice cream shop
may occasionally be required to enter a freezer to obtain a new carton of ice
cream.  In such circumstances, the minor is not considered to be working in a
freezer.  Such minors may not enter meat coolers, even momentarily.</p>

              <p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(j) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds as youth peddlers or door-to-door
salespersons.  Youth peddling entails the selling of goods or services to
customers at locations other than the youth employer's establishment, such as
the customers' residences or places of business, or public places such as
street corners or public transportation stations.</p><p>(1)  This provision does not prohibit a young salesperson
from conducting sales for his or her employer on property controlled by the
employer that is out of doors but may properly be considered part of the
employer's establishment.</p><p>(2)  Youth may conduct sales in such employer exterior
facilities, whether temporarily or permanent, as garden centers, sidewalk
sales, and parking lots sales, when employed by that establishment.</p><p>(b)  
Prohibited activities associated
with youth peddling not only include the actual attempt to make a sale or the
actual consummation of a sale, but also the preparatory and concluding tasks
normally performed in conjunction with making the sales.  These prohibited
activities include:</p><p>(1)  The loading and unloading of vans or other motor
vehicles; and the service as helpers on such vehicles (see FOH 33c07(c)(2)),</p><p>(2)  The stocking and restocking of sales kits and trays,
and</p><p>(3)  The exchanging of cash and checks with the employer.</p><p>(c)  
Youth peddling does not include
the activities of persons who, as volunteers and without compensation, sell
goods or services on behalf of eleemosynary organizations or public agencies,
such as schools.</p><p>(1)  WH considers individuals who volunteer or donate their
services, usually on a part-time basis, for public service, religious, or
humanitarian objections, without contemplation of pay, not to be employees of
the religious, charitable, or similarly nonprofit corporations that receive
their services.</p><p>(2)  As used in § 570.33(j), the term compensation does not
include the small prizes, trophies, or other awards of minimum value that the
eleemosynary organization may give a volunteer in recognition of his or her
efforts (see 75 FR 28413).</p>

29 CFR 570.33(k) prohibits 14- and
15-year-olds from loading and unloading goods or property to or from

570.33(k) to prohibit 14- and 15-year-olds from working with the types of
conveyors normally found at checkout counters in supermarkets and other retail
stores. </p><p>(1)  Such conveyors have solid surfaces, are fully
enclosed, and are designed with features that protect the hands and limbs of
both the operators and the customers who place materials on them or remove
purchases from them.  The cashier controls the operation of the conveyor
through a switch or foot pedal and the individual items placed on the conveyor
are neither large nor heavy.  There also may be other smaller conveyors located
beyond the cashier that transport the items that have been checked to a bin or
counter where they are bagged.  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may also work with
those types of conveyors. </p><p>(2)  On the other hand, some stores may have an additional
type of conveyor system that is often located between the checkout station and
the customer vehicle loading area in the front of the store.  These conveyors
may use plastic bins or other storage compartments to hold bags of groceries
that are transported to the vehicle loading area.  These types of conveyors are
not enclosed, convey heavy loads, and may present hazards to young employees
who load and unload them.  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are prohibited from
operating such conveyors under both § 570.33(k) and under the CL Reg 3 general
prohibition against operating or tending power-driven equipment.  Such youth
are prohibited from operating or tending such conveyors and may not load or
unload materials to or from such equipment.  </p>

29 CFR 570.33(l) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds to catch and coop poultry in preparation for
transportation or for market.  Such activity, often referred to as
&quot;chicken catching,&quot; is also banned as a processing occupation by 29 CFR

In those rare instances when the
catching activities would be agricultural in nature, such as where poultry
catchers are employed solely by a farmer on a farm to catch poultry raised by
that farmer, the catchers would be subject to the agricultural child labor

              <p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(m) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in the occupation of public messenger
service.  The term public messenger service as used in this section means the
kind of messenger service performed by delivery companies (companies whose
principal business is the delivery of letters, messages, and/or parcels), and
also, to the extent the law applies to them, telegraph companies (see 75 FR

water, pipeline,   or other means.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(n)(1) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations connected with the
transportation of persons or property by rail, highway, air, water, pipeline,
or other means.  This prohibition involves the transportation of “persons or
property” and not just “goods” which entails movement in commerce.  In
addition, 29 CFR 570.33(k) prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from loading or
unloading most goods or property onto or from motor vehicles, railroad cars, or
conveyors.</p><p>(b)  
This prohibition makes it unlawful
to employ 14- and 15-year-old minors in jobs clearly and directly related to
the operating, servicing, maintaining, or loading of media of transportation. 
CL Reg 3 does not, however, prohibit the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds to
pick up or deliver packages or messages—whether by foot, by bicycle, or by
riding on subways, buses, or taxis–as as long as the employer is not a public
messenger service (see FOH 33c19, see also 29 CFR 570.33(m)).  Such minors also
may perform office work or sales work that does not involve the performance of
any duties on media of transportation.  </p><p>(c)  
Occupations which are in
connection with transportation within the meaning of CL Reg 3 and are therefore
prohibited to 14- and 15-year-olds include:</p><p>(1)  Jobs performed on trains, boats, buses, or other media
of transportation,</p><p>(2)  Jobs performed in, on, or in close proximity to
roundhouses, railway tracks, repair shops, docks or wharfs, hangars, runways,
or other such places where power-driven equipment designed or used for
transportation (including train cars) is repaired, cleaned, or serviced, or may
be in motion,</p><p>(3)  Jobs in loading or unloading railway cars or tanks,
trucks, boats, planes, buses, or other media of transportation, and</p><p>(4)  Jobs that require riding in a motor vehicle.  Riding
in a motor vehicle would be prohibited under 29 CFR 570.33(f) if a significant
reason for the minor being a passenger in the vehicle is for the purpose of
transporting—or assisting in the transporting of—the persons or the property
(see § 570.34(o)).  The transportation of the persons or property does not have
to be the primary reason for the trip for this prohibition to apply (see FOH
33c07(d)).  </p>

tobacco auctions, which employment is more closely allied to sales work than to
warehousing and storage, but not excepting other occupations in the warehousing
of tobacco, such as regrading or rechecking tobacco, or handling heavy tobacco

In accordance with FLSA § 3(l),
nonexempt 14- and 15-year-olds may only be employed in those nonagricultural
occupations that the Secretary of Labor has determined do not interfere with
their health and well-being.  Occupations that are not specifically listed as
permitted are prohibited (see § 570.32).  Such youth must also be employed
in compliance with the hours standards established by § 570.35.  </p><p>(b)  
29 CFR 570.34 lists those jobs
that the Secretary of Labor has determined do not interfere with the health and
well-being of 14- and 15-year-olds.</p><p>(1)  29 CFR 570.33 details occupations in which 14- and
15-year-olds generally may not be employed.  This list is not exhaustive, but
reflects some of the more common areas of violation.  This list is provided to
add clarity to the list of permitted occupations detailed in 29 CFR 570.34.</p><p>(2)  Prior to July 19, 2010, the effective date of the 2010
Final Rule, the nonagricultural employment of 14- and 15-year-olds was
generally limited to retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments,
or in departments or discrete portions of the premises devoted to retailing,
food service, or gasoline service in other establishments.  The Final Rule
eliminated those limitations, thus expanding employment opportunities for this
age group into additional industries such as state and local government,
wholesale establishments, medical offices, and nonprofit organizations.</p><p>(c)  
The order in which the CL Reg 3

permitted occupations (see § 570.34) and the list of prohibited
occupations are discussed in FOH 33(c) (see § 570.33).  Because
§§ 570.33 and 570.34 tend to reinforce and provide clarity to each other,
considerable overlap between FOH 33c and 33d is to be expected.</p>

runway models, and church musical directors.</p><p>(1)  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds who are employed in
artistically creative endeavors will continue to be prohibited from performing
any of the occupations or tasks detailed in the revised § 570.33.  </p><p>(2)  These prohibitions include work in manufacturing and
processing occupations, the operation of most power-driven equipment, and any
duties in work rooms or work places where goods are manufactured or processed.</p><p>a.    
These prohibitions would prevent a
14- or 15-year-old from working in a factory or workroom as a “molder” or “hand
painter” producing mass quantities of nearly identical pottery or ceramic
items, but would permit the youth to express his or her artistic talents in a
potter studio to shape by hand a unique clay pot or sculpt a piece of art.  </p><p>b.    
Likewise, a 14- or 15-year-old
could be employed, with all the safeguards of §§ 570.33-.35, as a painter
of portraits but not as a painter of automobiles or houses.  </p><p>c.    
Similarly, a youth could be
employed to create unique photographs that rise to the level of art, but would
be prevented from developing those photographs and working with the chemicals
and solvents commonly used in such processing activities.  </p><p>d.    
WH stated in the Preamble to the
2010 Final Rule in response to a specific question that the Department of Labor
does not consider tattooing or body piercing to be artistically creative

previously adopted by WH.  </p><p>(1)  The core and defining duty of a lifeguard is to rescue
swimmers in danger of drowning, often by entering the water and physically
bringing the swimmer to safety (see 75 FR 28418).  CL Reg. 3 now prohibits the
employment of anyone under 15 years of age to perform this core duty; and
15-year-olds may do so only when properly certified. </p><p>(2)  Any employee under the age of 16 whose duties include
this core duty—such as a “junior lifeguard” or a “swim teacher aide”—or whose
employment could place him or her in a situation where the employer would
reasonably expect him or her to perform such rescue duties, would be performing
the duties of a lifeguard while working is such a position.  For such
employment to comply with CL Reg. 3, the employee must be at least 15 years of
age and be properly certified.  </p><p>(3)  A 15-year-old who has been properly certified as a
lifeguard, may also serve as a swimming instructor, but only when he or she has
also been properly certified as a swimming instructor by the American Red Cross
or some other recognized certifying agency (see 29 CFR 570.34(l)(2)).</p><p>(b)  
Where 15-year-old lifeguards may
and may not be employed:</p><p>(1)  Traditional swimming pools  </p><p>a.    
Properly certified 15-year-old
lifeguards may be employed at traditional swimming pools.  A traditional
swimming pool means a water tight structure of concrete, masonry, or other
approved materials located either indoors or outdoors, used for bathing or
swimming and filled with a filtered and disinfected water supply, together with
buildings, appurtenances and equipment used in connection therewith. </p><p>b.

apply irrespective of who owns, operates, or manages the pool.  Therefore, such
minors could be employed at hotel pools, apartment complex pools, and homeowner
association pools, as well as community pools.  </p><p>(2) 
Water amusement parks  </p><p>a.    
Properly certified 15-year-olds
may be employed as lifeguards at most facilities of a water amusement park.  A
water amusement park means an establishment that not only encompasses the
features of a traditional swimming pool, but also includes such additional attractions
as wave pools, lazy rivers, baby pools, activities areas,
and elevated water slides. </p><p>b.    
Fifteen- year-olds may serve as
lifeguards at the wave pools, the lazy rivers, the activities areas, the baby
pools, and at the receiving or splashdown areas of the elevated water slides.</p><p>c.    
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may not
be stationed at the top of an elevated water slide to monitor the slide
operations, keep order, and serve as “dispatcher” to ensure patrons properly
ride the slide.  The general prohibition against operating or tending
power-driven equipment contained in CL Reg. 3 prohibits youth under 16 from
performing these “nontraditional” lifeguard duties at the top or on the stairs
of an elevated slide.  This same prohibition prevents youth under 16 from being
employed to operate or tend, or serve as “attendants” on, amusement park rides</p><p>(3)  Natural environments.  No one under 16 years of age
may be employed as a lifeguard at rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, quarries,
reservoirs, wharfs, piers, canals, oceanside beaches, nor other natural
environments. </p><p>(c)  
The duties 15-year-old lifeguards
may perform include the following:</p><p>(1)  Rescuing swimmers in danger of drowning,</p><p>(2)  Monitoring activities at poolside to prevent
accidents,</p><p>(3)  Providing swimming lessons, but only if properly
certified to do so (see FOH 33d06(e)(3)a below,</p><p>(4)  Teaching water safety,</p><p>(5)  Providing assistance to patrons,</p><p>(6)  Helping maintain order and cleanliness in the pool and
pool areas,</p><p>(7)  Conducting and officiating at swim meets,</p><p>(8)  Administering first aid,</p><p>(9)  Checking in and out items such as towels, and personal
items such as rings, watches, and apparel,</p><p>(10)  Using a ladder to access and descend from a lifeguard
chair,</p><p>(11)  Using hand tools to clean the pool and pool area, and</p><p>(12)  Testing and recording water quality for temperature
and/or Ph levels, using all of the tools of the testing process including
adding chemicals to the test water sample.</p><p>(d)  
The duties 15-year-old lifeguards
may not perform include the following:</p><p>(1)  Such youth may not enter or work in any mechanical
room or chemical storage area, including any areas where the filtration and
chlorinating systems are housed.</p><p>(2)  Such youth may not operate or tend any power-driven
equipment, including power-driven elevated water slides often found at water
amusement parks and some swimming pools.</p><p>a.    
CL Reg. 3 prohibits the employment
of youths under 16 years of age as dispatchers or attendants at the top of
elevated water slides performing such tasks as maintaining order, directing
patrons as to when to depart the top of the slide, and ensuring that patrons
have begun their “ride” safely (see § 570.34(l)(2)).</p><p>b.    
Properly certified 15-year-old
lifeguards may be stationed at the “splashdown pools” at the bottom of the
elevated water slides to perform those permitted duties listed in FOH 33d06(b)
above.</p><p>c.    
The prohibition concerning tending
power-driven water slides would not apply to those small water slides designed
for use by very small children and often located in “baby pools.”  These slides
normally rise no more than five or ten feet are accessed by ramps that patrons
walk up rather than stairways or ladders.  Properly certified 15-year-old
lifeguards may tend these little slides designed for very small children.</p><p>(e)  
Certification</p><p>(1)  29 CFR 570.34(l) requires that 15-year-olds be trained
and certified in water safety and aquatics by the American Red Cross or a
similar certifying agency, before they may be employed as lifeguards or to
perform the core duties of a lifeguard as discussed in FOH 33d06(a)(1) above.</p><p>(2)  Normally, the youth will have in his or her custody a
certificate documenting that he or she has successfully completed all classroom
and practical skill sets necessary for certification as a lifeguard.  Such
certification will normally be sufficient for purposes of establishing
compliance with this portion of CL Reg. 3.</p><p>(3)  As per § 570.34(l)(2), 15-year-olds who, as part of
their employment, serve as swimming instructors—teaching others how to
swim—must not only hold proper certification as a lifeguard, but must also be
certified as a swimming instructor by the American Red Cross or some other
recognized certifying organization.</p><p>(4)  Once a lifeguard turns 16 years of age, this dual
requirement for certification, just as all the other provisions of CL Reg. 3,
end. </p><p>(5)  WH has determined that the following organizations
offer lifeguard certification programs that are similar to that offered by the
American Red Cross and therefore satisfy the requirements of § 570.34(l).  This
list is not to be considered exhaustive.</p><p>a.

              <p>(a)  
Nonagricultural employment</p><p>(1)  FLSA § 3(l) exempts from the definition of “oppressive
child labor,” and thus from FLSA § 12 coverage, employment by parents or
persons standing in place of parents of their own child or a child in their
custody, provided that the minor, if 16 or 17 years of age, is not employed in
an occupation covered by a non-agricultural HO.  </p><p>a.    
If the minor is under 16 years of
age, he or she may not be employed in an actual manufacturing or mining
occupation, or in an occupation covered by a non-agricultural HO.  Such minors
under 16 years of age may be employed in processing occupations or in a
manufacturing work room, if not employed in an actual manufacturing occupation
or in an occupation declared to be hazardous. </p><p>b.    
If the minor is under 16 years of
age, the CL Reg. 3 hours standards would not apply to the youth when he or she
was employed by a business owned by his or her parent or a person standing in
place of his or her parent.</p><p>(2)  The exemption applies only when the parent is the sole
employer of the minor.  If the parent is a partner in a partnership or an
officer of a corporation the parental exemption does not apply unless the
parents are the only members of the partnership or the sole owners of the
corporation.</p><p>(3)  The parental exemption in the FLSA was included to permit
children to be employed in some occupations by their parents on the basis that
a parent’s natural concern for his or her child’s well-being would serve to
protect the child.  </p><p>(4)  Application of this exemption is limited to the
employment of children exclusively by their parents.  Any other applications
would render the safeguard mentioned above ineffective.  The sole owner of a
business is in a position to regulate the duties of his or her child and
provide guidance.  Where the ownership of the corporation or partnership is
vested in persons other than the parent, the child is responsible to persons
other than his or her parent – his or her duties are regulated by the
corporation or partnership.</p><p>(b)

§ 13(c)(7) provides a limited exemption from the child labor provisions for
certain youth between the ages of 14 and 18 years who, by statute or judicial

outside of places of business that use power-driven machines to process wood
products, it does so only if such youth do not operate or assist in the
operation of power-driven woodworking machines (see FOH 33c01(a)
and 33h04(d)(2)).  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds whose employment falls under the

Section 13(c) provides that Sec 12
will apply to minors under 16 years of age employed in hazardous occupations in
agriculture unless employed by a parent or person standing in the place of a
parent.  (See FOH 33f03.)  Thus, the exemption for minors below the age of 16
employed in agriculture outside of school hours is limited to occupations which
have not been declared hazardous.  </p><p>(b)  
The definition of “agriculture” in

purposes of Sec 13(c)(1) or (2), regardless of whether or not the employment is
subject to the (6)(a)(5) MW.  </p><p>(c)  
The term “outside of school hours”
refers to the hours before and after school, holidays, Saturday, Sunday,
vacation time, and any day when the school in the district where the minor is

              <p>[Rev. 599, 12/28/93]</p><p>(a)  
The minimum age is 16 for
employment in agriculture during school hours unless: </p><p>(1)  The minor is employed exclusively by his or her parent
or by a person standing in the place of his or her parent. </p><p>(2)  The minor has completed his or her high school course.
</p><p>(3)  The minor is below the eligible entrance age in the
state. In states where there is no written eligible age, the compulsory age
becomes the eligible age. </p><p>(4)  The school, which the minor normally attends or would
normally attend in the district where he or she is living, is closed for crop
vacation or any other reason. In some communities, one school may close for
crop vacation while others in the same community remain in session.  The Inv
will need to find out which public or parochial school the minor attends and in
the case of the migrant minor, which public school he or she would normally
attend. </p><p>(5)  The school, due to crowded conditions, is operating on
a split shift basis.  Under this plan the school day is divided into half-day
sessions.  Some children attend classes in the morning and others in the
afternoon.  The children under these circumstances could be legally employed in
agriculture the half-day they are not required to attend school. </p><p>(6)  The administrative unit, such as the high school or
junior high school which the minor attends, is closed. The exemption makes no
provision for the release of individual children or any class or grade to work
in agriculture. </p><p>(b)  
Minors below 16 years of age may
not be employed in AG H.O.s except where employed by a parent or person
standing in the place of a parent on a farm owned or operated by the parent or
person standing in place thereof (see FOH 33f03). Thus, the
employment during school hours of minors under 16 years of age under the
conditions set forth in FOH 33f02(a)(2) through (6) above is permitted only
where the minor does not engage in such hazardous work.  </p>

              <h3>33f03.    HOs—agriculture (Ag H.O.s). [Rev. 599, 12/28/93]</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Section 13(c)(2) reads as follows:
“The provisions of section 12 of this title relating to child labor shall apply
to an employee below the age of sixteen employed in agriculture in an
occupation that the Secretary of Labor finds and declares to be particularly
hazardous for the employment of children below the age of 16, except where such
employee is employed by his parent or by a person standing in the place of his
parent on a farm owned or operated by such parent or person.” </p><p>(b)  
The 16-year minimum age for
agricultural employment in occupations declared to be hazardous applies to
covered agricultural employment which meets the definition given in Sec 3(f)
and without regard to whether or not such employment is subject to the MW
provided by Sec 6(a)(5). The 16-year minimum age does not depend upon whether
or not the employment is “outside school hours.” Thus, the 16-year minimum age
for such hazardous occupations applies during vacation periods as well as hours
before and after school or on nonschool days. </p><p>(c)  
The parental exemption from the Ag
H.O.s in Sec 13(c)(2) from the HO/A applies to the minor’s natural parent or to
a “person standing in the place of his parent”, as long as the employment is on
a farm owned or operated by such parent or person. </p><p>(d)  
Owned by the parent or person
standing in the place of the parent includes part ownership as a partner in a
partnership or as an officer of a corporation which owns the farm if the
ownership interest in the partnership or corporation is substantial. </p><p>(e)  
Operated by the parent or person standing in the place of the
parent means that the person exerts active and direct control over the
operation of the farm or ranch by making day-to-day decisions affecting basic
income, assigning work, hiring and firing employees and exercising direct
supervision of the farm or ranch work. Ranch managers, therefore, who meet
these criteria could employ his or her own children under 16 on the ranch they
operate without regard to the provisions of the HO/A. </p><p>(f)  
The 18-year minimum age set by the
17 nonagricultural HOs (see FOH 33h), does not apply to an
employee employed in “agriculture” as defined in § 3(f). For example, if a
minor under 18 is employed in agriculture and works as a driver on a motor
vehicle, HO 2 does not apply even though the minor may go “in or about” a
producing establishment to deliver the farmer’s products.  On the other hand,
if the minor’s employment does not meet the tests in Sec 3(f), HO 2 would apply
in the normal manner.  If a minor under 16 is employed in agriculture as
defined in Sec 3(f), he or she is subject only to the hazardous occupation
orders in agriculture set forth in (g) below. </p><p>(g)  
The following
occupations in agriculture have been declared hazardous by the Secretary of
Labor for the employment of minors under 16 years of age: </p><p>(1) 
Operating a tractor of
over 20 PTO (power takeoff) horsepower, or connecting or disconnecting an
implement or any of its parts to or from such a tractor: </p><p>a.    
Farm tractors overturn
easily and the operator or passenger may be seriously injured. Serious injuries
are complicated if the accident occurs in an isolated area and is not
discovered quickly. </p><p>b.    
The rotating drive
mechanisms of implements or power takeoff drives inflict serious injuries if
parts of the body or clothing come in contact with the exposed driveshaft or
moving parts. </p><p>c.    
Persons under 16 may
operate garden-type tractors. </p><p>(2) 
Operating or assisting
to operate (including starting, stopping, adjusting, feeding, or any other
activity involving physical contact associated with the operation) any of the
following machines: </p><p>a.    
Corn picker, cotton
picker, grain combine, hay mower, forage harvester, hay baler, potato digger,
or mobile pea viner. </p><p>1.    
These machines use
rotary gears, revolving shafts, driving chains, belts, augers, conveyor belts
and chains, knives, blowers, levers, and hydraulic pistons to grasp, cut,
pound, grind, convey, compress, push, or pull material. </p><p>2.    
The farm worker
sometimes comes in contact with the moving parts and is seriously injured when
he or she tries to unclog, repair, or adjust the machine when the motor is
running. </p><p>b.    
Feed grinder, crop
dryer, forage blower, auger conveyor, or the unloading mechanism of a
nongravity-type self loading wagon or trailer. </p><p>1.    
These machines, except
for some that are fed manually, are similar in construction and operation to
those described above, and involve the same hazards. There is an additional
danger that if a part of the body is caught by a turning auger, amputation is
almost unavoidable. </p><p>2.  
Persons under 16 may
move the crop to the person feeding the machine and remove the finished product
from the area; they may load and unload material from other types of conveyors,
such as belt, bucket, or chain. </p><p>3.  
The unloading of a
bulk body truck, including machines with self-unloading bulk boxes, meets the
description of this Ag H.O. and is prohibited for minors under age 16. However,
the operation of a potato bin piler is permitted for minors under 16 years of age
working on farms. </p><p>c.    
Power post-hole
digger, power post-driver, or nonwalking type rotary tiller. </p><p>1.    
The hazard of the
post-hole digger is the danger of becoming entangled with the rotating drive.
The hazard with the power post-hole driver, is a possibility of being struck by
the descending ram. </p><p>2.    
Persons under 16 may
set posts in holes, tamp the earth, attach and stretch wire, install gates, and
repair fences. </p><p>(3) 
Operating or assisting
to operate (including starting, stopping, adjusting, feeding, or any other
activity involving physical contact associated with the operation) any of the
following machines: </p><p>a.    
Trencher or
earthmoving equipment. The hazards of earthmoving or trenching equipment are
entanglement with moving parts and falling under a moving piece of equipment. </p><p>b.    
Forklift. Forklifts
have a double hazard of falling loads and overturning. They also accidentally
may be driven over the edge of platforms. </p><p>c.  
Potato combine </p><p>d.  
Power-driven circular,
band, or chain saw. The chief hazards in connection with saws are the danger of
amputation and severe cuts from contact with the cutting edge. </p><p>(4) 
Working on a farm in a
yard, pen, or stall occupied by a bull, boar, or stud horse maintained for
breeding purposes or a sow with suckling pigs, or cow with newborn calf (with
umbilical cord present): </p><p>a.    
Handling these animals
requires experience, skill, and strength. If they attack without warning,
escape is especially difficult from confined areas. </p><p>b.    
This section does not
prohibit work with these or any animals in an open area. It does not prohibit
work with beef or range bulls and cattle, dairy cattle, or breeding stock on
the range. </p><p>(5) 
Felling, bucking,
skidding, loading, or unloading timber with butt diameter of more than 6
inches: </p><p>Workers
under 16 are still permitted to work with timber up to 6 inches in diameter,
which includes most fence posts and tier poles.</p><p>(6)  Working from a ladder or scaffold (painting,
repairing, or building structures, pruning trees, picking fruit, etc., at a
height of over twenty feet:</p><p>a.    
Many severe injuries occur when
work is done from a ladder or scaffold at a considerable height.</p><p>b.    
This section does not prohibit
using ladders to reach a work site above twenty feet, as long as the work is
not done from a ladder or scaffold.</p><p>(7)  Driving a bus, truck, or automobile when transporting
passengers, or riding on a tractor as a passenger or helper:</p><p>a.    
Exposure to traffic while moving
at considerable speed makes driving a motor vehicle on a public road or highway
hazardous.  The additional responsibility of carrying passengers makes such
driving unsuitable for minors under 16 years of age.</p><p>b.    
In addition, most states will not
issue a driver’s license for a youth under 16 years of age.</p><p>c.    
Minors under 16 may drive a truck
or automobile on the farm itself.  However, they may not ride on any tractor or
serve as a helper on any tractor.</p><p>(8)  Working inside:</p><p>a.    
A fruit, forage, or grain storage
designed to retain an oxygen deficient or toxic atmosphere,</p><p>b.    
An upright silo within two weeks
after silage has been added or when a top unloading device is in operating
position,</p><p>c.    
A manure pit, or</p><p>d.    
A horizontal silo while operating
a tractor for packing purposes.</p><p>1.    
When oxygen is replaced by another
gas or consumed by fermentation, anyone entering these storage areas is in
danger of asphyxiation.</p><p>2.    
If the top unloading device is in
operating position in the silo, a person may become entangled in its cutting
and tearing mechanism and be seriously injured.</p><p>3.    
Employees under 16 may work inside
the non-gas-tight type silo while the unloading device is in a raised position,
and they may also operate this device from outside the silo.</p><p>4.    
The hazard involved in operating a
tractor for packing purposes in a horizontal silo is the danger of overturning.</p><p>(9)  Handling or applying (including cleaning or
decontaminating equipment, disposal or return of empty containers, or serving a
s flagman for aircraft applying) agricultural chemicals classified under the
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 135 et seq.)
as Category I of toxicity, identified by the word “poison” and the “skull
and crossbones” on the label or Category II of toxicity, identified by the word
“warning” on the label:</p><p>a.    
Many agricultural chemicals
present serious health hazards.  Some have a corrosive effect on body tissue. 
Some affect the central nervous system, causing respiratory failures and many
cause death by the accumulation of even minute quantities over a prolonged
period.</p><p>b.    
The hazards involved in the job of
flagman are that the employee must stand in the line of the flight to direct
the pilot and also because of the possibility of contamination from the
chemicals being applied.</p><p>c.    
Minors under 16 may handle and
apply fertilizers or chemicals that are not labeled as indicated by this AG H.O.</p><p>(10)  Handling or using a blasting agent, including but not
limited to, dynamite, black powder, sensitized ammonium nitrate, blasting caps,
and primer cord:  </p><p>The
use of blasting agents requires experience and expertise.  Mishandling can
result in accidental detonation, maiming, or loss of life.</p><p>(11)  Transporting, transferring, or applying anhydrous
ammonia:</p><p>Vapors
are very irritating to the eyes and to the respiratory system.  In case of
contact with the skin, it may result in severe burns.  Too high a concentration
of vapors could cause suffocation.</p><p>(a)  
The following are some examples of
work activities not affected by the Ag H.O.s.:</p><p>(1)  Handling chemical pesticides and fertilizers not
included in Item (9) above,</p><p>(2)  Driving a truck, automobile, or bus on the farm proper
and serving as helpers on such vehicles,</p><p>(3)  Loading and unloading trucks,</p><p>(4)  Operating garden-type tractors,</p><p>(5)  Picking vegetables and berries, and placing them on
conveyors or in containers,</p><p>(6)  Clearing brush and harvesting trees up to 6 inches in
butt diameter,</p><p>(7)  Working from ladders at heights less than 20 feet,
such as picking of most fruits</p><p>(8)  Working with farm animals, except work with certain breeding
stock in confined areas, including showing any animal at livestock shows,
fairs, exhibits, or similar activities when not taking place on a farm,</p><p>(9)  Hand planting and cultivation,</p><p>(10)  Raising and caring for poultry,</p><p>(11)  Milking cows,</p><p>(12)  Processing and storing milk and dairy products,</p><p>(13)  Cleaning barns, equipment storage buildings, chicken
coops, etc.,</p><p>(14)  Mowing lawns,</p><p>(15)  Riding, driving, or exercising horses,</p><p>(16)  Picking cotton,</p><p>(17)  Handling of irrigation pipes,</p><p>(18)  Harvesting and storing tobacco,</p><p>(19)  Riding on transplanters.</p>

              <p>(a)  
Section 3(l) of the FLSA, which
defines “oppressive child labor,” prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from
performing those occupations which the Secretary of Labor finds and declares to
be particularly hazardous for the employment of children between such ages or
detrimental to their health or well-being.  Under this authority, the Secretary
has issued 17 Hazardous Occupations Orders (HOs).</p><p>(b)  
The HOs specifically cover 16- and
17-year-old minors.  But minors under 16 years of age are also banned from
performing any of the occupations prohibited by the HOs because of CL Reg 3 (see
29 CFR 570.33(b)).</p>

              <h3>33g01. How HOs are created.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
All the HOs were originally issued
between 1939 and 1963.  The first six HOs were issued by the now defunct
Children's Bureau.  Reorganization Plan No. 2 transferred the authority to
issue HOs to the Division of Labor Standards, effective July 16, 1946.  HOs 7
through 17 were issued by the Child Labor and Youth Employment Branch of the
Division of Labor Standards or its successor agencies, often with technical
help from either the Division of Safety Standards or experts in the industry
being studied.  </p><p>(1)  The process used to issue the original HOs consisted
of conducting an investigation (study) of an industry, process, or machinery
considered to be dangerous for young employees.  Hearings would often be held
and a committee of interested parties would often be convened to make
recommendations.  The process culminated with the issuance of a report that detailed
the hazards involved and actually presented the HO.  The reports established
the range and scope of each HO, coverage, and any exclusions and exemptions.
These reports still remain the basis for opinions issued under each of the
original HOs, although subsequent amendments to the HOs have expanded their
scope.  </p><p>(2)  Recent changes to individual HOs have resulted from
such things as legislation, stakeholder input, academic studies, and WHD
enforcement experiences.  Detailed information concerning these changes are
provided in the preambles of the Federal Register publications issued during
rulemaking.</p><p>(b)  
The procedure used to establish
the HOs (found in Child Labor Regulation No. 5, previously incorporated in
subpart D of 29 CFR 570.41 through 570.49) preceded the enactment of the
Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  On April 17, 1995, the Department
published a notice in the Federal Register (60 FR 19336), which
deleted subpart D; consequently, any amendments to existing HOs or creation of
new HOs must now follow the procedures established by the APA.</p>

              <h3>33g02.   The effect of the 1961 and 1966 FLSA Amendments on HOs.</h3>
              <p>The
HOs, with the exception of HO 16 and HO 17, were issued before enactment of the
1961 and 1966 FLSA Amendments which brought many previously uncovered
establishments under the provisions of the Act (retail, construction, state and
local governments).  Most of the original reports establishing the HOs did not
address retail operations because of the limited FLSA coverage, however, many
of the HOs have since been amended to address their application to retail
operations. </p>

              <h3>33g03  . Industry, process-oriented, or machine-specific HOs.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
Certain HOs apply to whole
industries or processes.  These include:</p><p>HO
1 — Manufacturing or Storing of Explosives,</p><p>HO
3 — Coal Mining,</p><p>HO 4 — Forest Fire Fighting and Fire Prevention,
Timber Tract and Forestry Service Occupations, and Logging and Sawmilling
Operations,</p><p>HO
9 — Mining other than Coal Mining,</p><p>HO
10—Slaughtering, Meat and Poultry Packing, Processing, or Rendering,</p><p>HO
13—Manufacturing Brick, Tile, and Kindred Products, </p><p>HO
15—Wrecking, Demolition and Shipbreaking Operations,</p><p>HO
16—Roofing Operations and on or about a Roof, and </p><p>HO
17—Excavation Operations.  </p><p>Generally,
most of the work in the named industry or process is prohibited—with a few
exceptions—such as office or maintenance work performed outside of the production
area.</p><p>(b)  
Other HOs address only families of
machines or specific acts.  In some instances, many machines common to an
industry are prohibited.  These include:</p><p>HO
2  —Motor Vehicle Occupations,</p><p>HO
5  —Power-Driven Woodworking Machines,</p><p>HO
6  —Exposure to Radioactive Substances and Ionizing Radiation, and</p><p>HO
12—Balers, Compactors, and Power-Driven Paper Products Machines.</p><p>(c)  
Other HOs prohibit only those
machines that specifically are named as being dangerous.  These include:</p><p>HO
7  —Power-Driven Hoisting Apparatus,</p><p>HO
8  —Power-Driven Metal Forming, Punching and Shearing Machines,</p><p>HO
11—Power-Driven Bakery Machines, and</p><p>HO
14—Power-Driven Circular Saws, Band Saws, Guillotine Shears, Chain Saws; Reciprocating
Saws, Wood Chippers, and Abrasive Cutting Discs.</p><p>(d)   A few of the HO
prohibitions are so broad in scope that they include not only the machines used
in the industry at the time the report was issued but any similar machines
developed after the issuance of the HO.  For example, the ban on woodworking machines
(HO 5) includes all computerized woodworking machines, and the ban on high-lift
trucks (HO 7) includes all types and uses of such trucks, whether specifically
identified or not.</p><p>(e)   There are separate
Hazardous Occupations Orders covering agricultural work (AG H.O.) which prohibit
minors under age 16 from performing certain tasks on farms.  These are
discussed and defined in subpart E-1 of 29 CFR part 570.  Agricultural work
activities must be separated from nonagricultural activities so that the appropriate
child labor standard is applied.</p><p>(f)   In order to reduce
confusion, the scope of each HO is discussed separately in the sections
covering the individual HOs (see FOH 33g05 and 33h).</p>

              <h3>33g04.   Special purposes of HO 14.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
The report establishing HO 14 considered
the general safety of work associated with circular saws, band saws and
guillotine shears.  The report found that the operation of this equipment is
hazardous wherever used, and that setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and
cleaning of these machines are also hazardous.  This led WH to review the scope
of other HOs and it was determined that only HO 5 specifically prohibited
these ancillary activities. Accordingly, HOs 8, 10, 11 and 12 were revised to
prohibit minors from setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and cleaning the
machines prohibited by those HOs.</p><p>(b)  
HO 14 serves as a “catch-all” HO. 
It prohibits minors from operating circular saws, band saws guillotine shears,
chain saws, wood chippers, abrasive cutting discs, and reciprocating saws in
any employment situation where this machinery is not prohibited by any of the
other HOs.  This is discussed further in the Scope of HO 14 (see
FOH 33h14(a)).</p>

              <p>The
HOs are designed to be mutually exclusive.  Certain machines, however, may fall
under different HOs at different times because their functions can vary, as
when different attachments are used.  For example, a dough mixer prohibited
under HO 11 would be prohibited under HO 10 if a meat grinding attachment were
added to make hamburger.  Likewise, there may be situations when the illegal
employment of a youth will fall under several HOs (e.g., the employment of a
16-year-old youth in a coal mine, while using a circular saw, would constitute
a violation of HO 3 and HO 14).  </p>

              <h3>33g06.   Apprentices and student-learners.</h3>
              <p>(a)  
HOs 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17
contain limited exemptions for apprentices and student-learners provided they
are employed under certain conditions (see 29 CFR 570.50).  None
of these limited exemptions, however, permit apprentices or student-learners to
drive motor-vehicles as part of their training programs.</p><p>(b)  
<b>Apprentices</b>.  The provisions of the HOs listed in (a) above do
not apply to the employment of apprentices provided:</p><p>(1)  the apprentice is employed in a craft recognized as an
apprenticeable trade (the Office of Apprenticeship (OA), part of the Employment
Training Administration can provide guidance),</p><p>(2)  the work of the apprentice in the hazardous occupation
is incidental to the apprentice training, is intermittent and for short periods
of time, and under the direct and close supervision of a journey worker, and</p><p>(3)  the apprentice is registered by OA (or a state agency
approved by OA) or is employed under a written apprenticeship agreement which
conforms to federal or state standards as determined by the Secretary of Labor.</p><p><b>(c)  
</b><b>Student-Learners </b></p><p>(1)  The provisions of the HOs listed in (a) above do not
apply to the employment of a student-learner enrolled in a course of study and
training in a cooperative vocational training program under a recognized state
or local educational authority or in a course of study in a substantially
similar program conducted by a private school, provided that the student-learner
is employed under a written agreement which provides:</p><p>a.    
That the work of the
student-learner in the occupation declared particularly hazardous shall be
incidental to the training,</p><p>b.    
That such work shall be
intermittent and for short periods of time, and under the direct and close
supervision of a qualified and experienced person,</p><p>c.    
That safety instruction shall be
given by the school and correlated by the employer with on-the-job training,
and</p><p>d.    
That a schedule of organized and
progressive work processes to be performed on the job shall have been prepared.</p><p>(2)  The student-learner discussed in this section can be
(and usually is) different from those student-learners for whom an employer may
obtain a certificate to pay a subminimum wage under 29 CFR part 520.  An
employer does not have to obtain the special certificate that allows him or her
to employ student-learners at wages less than the minimum wage in order to take
advantage of this limited exemption from certain HOs.</p><p>(3)  WH considers a Jobs Corps training program to be
equivalent to “a course of study in a substantially similar program conducted
by a private school” under 29 CFR 570.50(c)(1) and employers of Job
Corps enrollees could take advantage of the limited exemption for
student-learners if all the other conditions listed
in 29 CFR 570.50(c) are met.</p><p>(4)  A high school graduate may be employed in an
occupation in which he or she has successfully completed training as a
student-learner without the restrictions imposed by 29 CFR 570.50(c)(1)
and (2), even though he or she is not yet 18 years of age.  Such minors must be
employed in compliance with the all the remaining child labor provisions (the
remaining HOs that do not have student learner exemptions).  Merely graduating
from high school is not sufficient to trigger this limited exemption from the
student-learner provisions; the minor must also have successfully completed the
appropriate vocational training.</p><p>(5) 
The
student-learner exemption is not limited to the school term but applies during
the summer vacation provided all the terms of the exemption are met (see
29 CFR 570.50(c)).  The required “direct and close supervision” and
safety instructions will ordinarily be provided by the coordinator or an
appropriate school official during the summer months.  It is also necessary to
establish that the student  plans to be enrolled in a bona fide vocational
education program the term following the vacation period.</p><p>(d)  
The following
definitions, applicable to the limited exemption from certain HOs, were
discussed in detail in the preamble of the April 17, 2007 Advance Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking (see 72 FR 19328,
19332).</p><p>(1) 
The terms intermittent
and short periods of time are not defined in the regulations and determinations
concerning the employment of each apprentice and student-learner are made on a
case-by-case basis after reviewing all the facts of the particular situation. 
The following items will be considered when making such determinations:</p><p>a.    
An apprentice or
student-learner may not be the principal operator of prohibited machinery.  He
or she must work under the close supervision of a fully qualified and
experienced adult, such as a journey-level worker in the case of an apprentice.</p><p>b.    
The duties assigned
the minor may not be such that he or she is constantly operating the prohibited
machinery during the work shift, but may only do so when required by the
training experience.  This precludes an apprentice or student-learner from
being a production worker responsible for spending a significant proportion of
the workday performing prohibited work.</p><p>c.    
While no universal time line may be imposed, the
continuous performance of otherwise prohibited work (operating prohibited
machinery) for more than one hour in a workday is more than intermittent and
more than for a “short period of time.”  The performance of otherwise
prohibited work throughout a work shift which totals
more than 20% of the apprentice’s or student-learner’s work shift is also more
than for a “short period of time.”</p><p>(2)  The
term direct and close supervision is not defined in the regulations. 
Apprenticeship agreements registered with OA or OA-approved state agencies,
however, do establish ratios concerning the number of journey workers and
apprentices that may be on the job site at any one time.  These ratios help ensure
worker safety and that the apprentices receive both proper training and
supervision.  According to OA, the most widely used ratio is one apprentice for
the first journey level worker on-site and one apprentice for every three
additional journey workers thereafter.  For the purpose of the limited
exemption contained in 29 CFR 570.50, the requirement of direct and
close supervision is met when there is one journey worker or experienced adult
working with the first apprentice or student-learner on-site, and at least
three journey workers or experienced adults working along side each additional
apprentice or student-learner.  The requirement for direct and close
supervision only applies during the periods when the apprentice or
student-learner is actually performing the otherwise prohibited work.</p>

              <p>(a)  
As part of our YouthRules!
initiative, WH has produced a supply of special “STOP” stickers which employers
may place on hazardous equipment to alert workers that they must be at least 18
years of age to operate and/or clean the equipment.  The stickers are
appropriate for use on meat slicers, forklifts, balers, compactors,
power-driven bakery equipment, freight elevators, power saws, etc.  These stickers
may also be downloaded from the YouthRules! Website.</p><p>(b)  
There are three versions of these
stickers:  </p><p>(1)  One warns employees that they must be “18 TO OPERATE
OR CLEAN THIS EQUIPMENT” and encourages the reader to contact WH for more
information about the CL laws (see Exhibit A below).</p><p>(2)  One states “NO OPERATORS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE” and
encourages the reader to contact the Wage and Hour Division for more
information about the CL laws (see Exhibit B below). </p><p>(3)  The third sticker, designed exclusively for use on forklifts
in nonagricultural work places, states in English and Spanish “No operators
under 18 years of age—IT’S THE LAW.”  The forklift stop sticker was developed
in conjunction with the Massachusetts Department of Health and the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (see Exhibit C
below). </p><p>(c)  
Employers who use these stickers
should place them in conspicuous spots on the equipment, but never cover up
other important information such as safety instructions, model numbers, or
emergency guidelines.</p><p>(d)  
Use of the stickers does not
remove, in any way, an employer’s obligation to ensure compliance with all CL
provisions at all times.</p><p></p><p>Exhibit A</p><p></p><p>Exhibit B</p><p></p><p>Exhibit C</p>

Occupations in or about Plants or Establishments Manufacturing or Storing
Explosives or Articles Containing Explosive Components </p><p>Originally
Adopted:  July 1, 1939</p><p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 1</b></p><p>(1)  Workers in plants or establishments manufacturing or
storing explosives, including articles containing explosive components, are
especially subject to accident from explosions despite the progress made by
manufacturers and OSHA in developing safeguards.  The finding of the original
investigation accompanying the report was that the accident severity rate for
explosive manufacturing was about twice as great as the average for all
manufacturing industries in 1936.  The injuries resulting from such explosions
are often serious, resulting in fatalities or permanent injuries.</p><p>(2)  This order deals with occupations in plants or
establishments engaged in manufacturing, handling, storing, and transporting of
explosives, articles containing explosive components, small arms ammunition,
blasting caps and primers.  This includes fireworks (see FOH 33h01(a)(4)a
for the definitions of the terms explosives and articles
containing explosive components).</p><p>(3)  The order does not apply to the following:</p><p>a.    
Retail stores, including the
storage of ammunition in gun shops, sporting goods stores, building supplies
and hardware stores; retail fireworks stands; and other retail establishments. </p><p>b.    
Gun clubs, trap and skeet ranges,
turkey shoots, certain armories, police stations and other such areas where
only small arms ammunition is being stored. </p><p>c.    
The use of explosives in mining
operations is covered by HOs 3 and 9.  The use of explosives in demolition and
ship-breaking work is covered by HO 15.  The use of explosives in excavation
work is covered by HO 17.  Storage of explosives at such sites, however, is
covered under HO 1. </p><p>(4)  Definitions</p><p>a.    
The terms explosives and articles
containing explosive components mean and include ammunition, black powder,
blasting caps, fireworks, high explosives, primers, smokeless powder, and
explosives and explosive materials as defined in 18 U.S.C. 841(c)-(f) and the
implementing regulations at 27 CFR part 555.  The terms include any chemical
compound, mixture, or device, the primary or common purpose of which is to
function by explosion, as well as all goods identified in the most recent list
of explosive materials published by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms,
and Explosives, Department of Justice.  This list is not intended to be
all-inclusive and is updated and published annually in the Federal
Register pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 841(d).  A copy of the most recent
version of the list may be found through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms, and Explosive’s Website located at <a href="http://www.atf.gov">www.atf.gov</a>.</p><p>b.    
The term plant or establishment
manufacturing or storing explosives or articles containing explosive components
means the land with all the buildings and other structures thereon used in
connection with the manufacturing or processing or storing of explosives or
articles containing explosive components.  Types of establishments which may
store these materials include ammunition depots, dynamite magazines, bunkers,
armories, and fireworks warehouses.</p><p>c.    
The term nonexplosives areas as
used in the exception in HO 1 are those which meet all four criteria found in
29 CFR 570.51(b)(3) and listed below (the criteria are such that ordinarily
only areas in large plants or establishments could qualify – a small fireworks plant
or establishment would not ordinarily cover such a large area that it could
sustain a “nonexplosives area”):</p><p>1.    
None of the work performed in the
area involves the handling or use of explosives.</p><p>2.    
The area is separated from the
explosives area by a distance not less than that prescribed in the American
Table of Distances for the protection of inhabited buildings.  The American
Table of Distances, published by the Institute of Makers of Explosives, was
last revised in 1991.  The table lists “minimum safe distances” for the
location of explosive storage and manufacturing buildings from inhabited
buildings, railways, highways, etc.  These distances vary with the type and
amount of explosive materials.</p><p>3.    
The area is separated from the
explosives area by a fence or is otherwise located so that it constitutes a
definite designated area.  The phrase “or is otherwise located so that is
constitutes a definite designated area” was included to bring in any area which
is located at a great distance from the explosives area, or is on the other
side of a natural barricade at least comparable to a fence.</p><p>4.    
Satisfactory controls have been
established to prevent employees under 18 years of age within the area from
entering any area in or about the plant that does not meet the above three
criteria.  The painting of a warning on the doors of all buildings containing
explosives advising minors under 18 years of age to stay out does not satisfy
this requirement.  Such warnings would have no actual restraining effect on
employees under 18 years of age and, by themselves, would not constitute a
satisfactory control within the intent of 29 CFR 570.51(b)(3).</p><p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b>.   Sixteen- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from
performing:</p><p>(1)  All occupations in or about any plant or establishment
(other than retail establishments and those establishments which manufacture or
store small-arms ammunition as described in FOH 33h01(b)(2) below); except 16-
and 17-year-olds may perform work that does not involve the handling or use of explosives
in qualifying “nonexplosives areas.”</p><p>(2)  The following work in plants manufacturing or storing
small-arms ammunition not exceeding .60 caliber in size, shotgun shells, or
blasting caps when manufactured or stored in conjunction with the manufacture of
small-arm ammunitions: </p><p>a.    
All occupations involved in the
manufacturing, mixing, transporting, or handling of explosive compounds in the
manufacture of small-arms ammunition and all other occupations requiring the
performance of any duties in the explosives area in which explosive compounds
are manufactured or mixed.</p><p>b.    
All occupations involved in the
manufacturing, transporting, or handling of primers and all other occupations
requiring the performance of any duties in the same building in which primers
are manufactured.</p><p>c.    
All occupations involved in the
priming of cartridges and all other occupations requiring the performance of
any duties in the same work room in which rim-fire cartridges are primed.</p><p>d.    
All occupations involved in the
plate loading of cartridges and in the operation of automatic loading machines.</p><p>e.    
All occupations involved in the
loading, inspecting, packing, shipping, and storage of blasting caps.</p><p>(3)  The following work peculiar to the “fireworks”
industry.</p><p>a.    
HO 1 applies to homeworkers engaged
in the manufacture of fireworks in their own homes.  Since explosives are
stored in the home prior to and after assembly, a homeworker’s home would meet
the definition of a “plant or establishment manufacturing or storing
explosives.”</p><p>b.    
HO 1 applies to “shooters” who are
hired by various civic organizations and governments to transport fireworks
from the manufacturer or wholesaler to the display site, set up the fireworks
at the site, load mortars (tubes from which the shells are fired), and fire
shells.  Fireworks must be temporarily stored at the site prior to the
display.  The term “establishments storing explosives” in 29 CFR 570.51(b)(1)
is sufficiently broad to cover these storage situations.  </p><p>(4)  Work which involves the storage of ammunition and/or
explosives. </p><p>a.    
HO 1 applies to any establishment,
other than a retail establishment, which stores ammunition (other than
small-arms ammunition not exceeding .60 caliber) or explosives, regardless of
whether or not manufacturing takes place at the facility.  </p><p>b.    
Minors 16 and 17 years of age,
however, could work in a “nonexplosives area” of such an establishment or at an
establishment where only small-arms ammunition was stored.  Central warehouses
used by retail stores, lacking the retail concept, would also be covered by HO
1. </p><p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b></p><p>(1)  HO 1 does not cover retail establishments selling
explosives or articles containing explosive components such as hardware stores,
fireworks outlets, or building supply stores.  Individual storerooms, located
at retail stores used to stock merchandise sold by that store, are also not
covered by HO 1 (see FOH 33h01(b)(4)b above concerning
warehouses).</p><p>(2)  Work in plants manufacturing explosives, in plants
storing explosives, and in plants manufacturing articles containing explosive
components which does not involve the handling or use of explosives and which
is performed in a “nonexplosives area.”</p><p>(3)  All work in plants manufacturing or storing small-arms
ammunition (not exceeding .60 caliber) or blasting caps that is not
specifically prohibited by HO 1.  Examples include working as an inspector,
office work, machine operators (if not covered by HOs 5 or 8), packing (except
blasting caps), shipping, and other work not involving the handling of explosives.</p><p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p><p>There
are no provisions in HO 1 for apprentices or student-learners.  There are no
other exemptions applicable to this order.  </p><p>(e)  
Enforcement positions</p><p>(1) 
Geophysical survey
crews</p><p>a.    
Jug handlers (those
who help string the wire from the shooting hole to the recording equipment) in
geophysical surveys which involve the detonation of explosives in underground
locations are not subject to the prohibitions of HO 1.</p><p>b.    
The overnight parking
of trucks containing explosives used by the survey crews is not sufficient for
the trucks to be considered establishments storing explosives.</p><p>(2)  Generally, no area in fireworks plants can meet the
“non-explosive area” criteria of 29 CFR 570.51(b)(3).</p>

              <h3>33h02.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 2—Motor-Vehicle Occupations.</h3>
              <p>Name: 
Occupations of Motor-vehicle Driver and Outside Helper</p>Originally Adopted:  January 1, 1940<p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 2 </b></p><p>(1)  Driving a motor vehicle involves a high degree of
accident risk for persons of all ages, and is particularly hazardous for minors
between the ages of 16 and 18 due to their lack of experience.  Despite the
prohibitions of HO 2, transportation-related deaths, largely
highway incidents, remained the most frequently recorded cause of occupational
deaths of 16- and 17-year-olds between 1980 and 2007.  HO 2 applies to all
employers subject to the nonagricultural CL provisions of the FLSA and, with a
limited statutory exception, specifically prohibits the employment of persons
under the age of 18 as motor-vehicle operators and as “outside helpers” on any
public road, highway and in or about any mine (including open pit mine or
quarry), place where logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any
excavation covered by HO 17.  However, driving on private property (other than
described above) is permitted.  These provisions apply whether the employee is
driving a personal or business owned-vehicle.</p><p>(2)  The Drive for Teen Employment Act, effective October
31, 1998, amended the FLSA by creating § 13(c)(6) and established the
conditions under which 17-year-olds (but not those under 17 years of age) may
drive certain automobiles and trucks on the job.  </p><p>(3)  Definitions</p><p>a.    
The
term motor vehicle shall mean any automobile, truck, truck-tractor, trailer,
semi-trailer, motorcycle, or similar vehicle propelled or drawn by mechanical
power and designed for use as a means of transportation but shall not include
any vehicle operated exclusively on rails.</p><p>1.    
The
above definition is not dependent upon the source of energy – vehicles may be
propelled by gasoline, propane, electricity, etc.</p><p>2.    
This
definition does not require that the motor vehicle be licensed or outfitted
with special equipment, nor is the size of the vehicle a factor.  Golf carts,
all terrain vehicles (ATVs), and riding mowers designed or used as a means of
transportation, meet the definition of “motor vehicles” and fall within the
scope of HO 2 when operated on any public road or highway (see 75 FR 28409). </p><p>3.    
The
term “similar vehicle” includes buses, vans, mopeds, pickup trucks, panel
trucks, recreational vehicles, ice-cream and chuck-wagon-type trucks, motorized
trail bikes, jeeps, and other all terrain vehicles.</p><p>b.    
The
term driver shall mean any individual who, in the course of employment, drives
a motor vehicle at any time. </p><p>c.    
The
term outside helper shall mean any individual, other than a driver, whose work
includes riding on a motor vehicle outside the cab for the purpose of assisting
in transporting or delivering goods.</p><p>d.    
The
term gross vehicle weight includes the truck chassis with lubricants, water and
a full tank or tanks of fuel, plus the weight of the cab or driver’s
compartment, body and special chassis and body equipment, and payload.</p><p>e.    
The
term occasional and incidental driving is now defined in the FLSA as driving
that involves no more than one-third of the worktime in any work day and no
more than 20 percent of the worktime in any workweek.</p><p>f.     
The
term urgent, time-sensitive deliveries means trips which, because of such
factors as customer satisfaction, the rapid deterioration of the quality or
change in temperature of the product, and/or economic incentives, are subject
to time-lines, schedules, and/or turn around times which might impel the driver
to hurry in the completion of the delivery.  Prohibited trips would include,
but are not limited to, the delivery of pizzas and prepared foods to the
customers; the delivery of materials under a deadline (such as deposits to a
bank at closing, or parts to a job site for the completion of an emergency
repair job); and the shuttling of passengers to and from transportation depots to
meet transport schedules.  Urgent, time sensitive deliveries do not depend on
the delivery’s points of origin and termination, and include the delivery of
people and things to the employer’s place of business as well as from that
business to some other location.</p><p>g.    
To
define the term public road, WHD uses the generally accepted definition of a
public road as “a road or way established and adopted (or accepted as a
dedication) by the proper authorities for the use of the general public, and
over which every person has a right to pass and to use it for all purposes of
travel or transportation to which it is adapted and devoted.  The proper test
in determining whether [a] road is a ‘public’ or ‘private road’ is [the] use to
which such roadway is put, and [the] fact that [the] road has been constructed
at public expense is not conclusive” (Bush &amp; Burchett, Inc. v. Reich, 117
F.3d 932, 938 n. 11 (6th Cir. 1997), citing Black's Law Dictionary
1329 (6th ed. 1990)).  Under this standard, a pathway or road in or
at the perimeter of a City park would not be considered a public road, if it is
used only by pedestrians, bicyclists, golf carts, and similar traffic to access
parts of the park grounds for recreational purposes.  But if the pathway or
road is used by automobiles or trucks to traverse the park or to access park
facilities for purposes such as delivery of goods, then it would be considered
a public road.</p><p>(b)   <b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  Driving any type of motor vehicle on public roads or
highways and in or about any mine (including open pit mine or quarry), place
where logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any excavation
covered by HO 17, except as authorized by § 13(c)(6).</p><p>(2)  Riding outside the cab of a vehicle as an outside
helper.</p><p>(3)  Towing of any vehicles. </p><p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b></p><p>(1)  Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may operate motor vehicles
on private property other than any mine (including open pit mine or quarry),
place where logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any excavation
covered by HO 17.</p><p>(2)  Other motorized vehicles to which HO 2 does not apply</p><p>a.    
HO 2
does not apply to self-propelled vehicles that are designed to perform work as
distinguished from being used “as a means of transportation.”  This includes
certain types of riding mowers, farm tractors, bulldozers, road scrapers, and
other vehicles not suitable for travel on public streets, geared only for
off-the-road use, and only designed for use on construction sites, grassy areas
and along walk paths.  When it is necessary to move such vehicles any distance,
they are generally loaded on a lowboy-type flatbed trailer and transported from
job site to job site.  Some of these vehicles, however, may be prohibited under
HO 17 when used in excavation.  Note:  See “Enforcement positions”
(FOH 33h02(e)(3)) regarding riding mowers and golf carts that must cross
public roads to complete a work assignment.</p><p>b.    
Trucks
that have equipment permanently mounted on them (such as mobile drilling rigs)
or equipment that has its own built-in means of transport are considered motor
vehicles under HO 2 and fall under the prohibitions of the HO when
operated on public roads.  Some of these trucks and pieces of equipment can
travel at speeds in excess of 30 miles per hour.  </p><p>c.    
Certain
electric carts are used as a means of transportation in large industrial
plants, and at railroad stations and airport terminals.  Generally, such
vehicles are outside the scope of HO 2 unless employees use these vehicles as a
means of transportation on a public street.  Thus, 16- and 17-year-old minors
may operate motorized vehicles such as riding mowers or golf carts as long as
they are not driven on public roads.</p><p>(d)   <b>Exemptions</b></p><p>(1)  HO 2 does not contain an
exemption for apprentices or student-learners.  Furthermore, none of the
limited exemptions applicable to HOs 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17 permit
apprentices or student-learners to drive motor-vehicles as part of their
training programs.</p><p>(2)  Occasional and
incidental driving by 17-year-olds.  The Drive for Teen Employment Act, enacted
on October 31, 1998, amended the FLSA to permit 17-year-olds (but not those
under 17 years of age) to drive automobiles and trucks as part of their
employment if all of the following criteria are met:</p><p>a.     The automobile or truck does
not exceed 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight,</p><p>b.     The driving is
restricted to daylight hours,</p><p>c.     The minor holds a state
license valid for the type of driving involved in the job performed,</p><p>d.     The minor has
successfully completed a state approved driver education course,</p><p>e.     The minor has no records
of any moving violation at the time of hire,</p><p>f.      The vehicle is equipped
with a seat belt for the driver and any passengers and the employer has
instructed the youth that the seat belts must be used when driving the vehicle,</p><p>g.     The driving does not
involve:</p><p>1.     Towing
vehicles,</p><p>2.     Route
deliveries or route sales,</p><p>3.     Transportation
for hire of property, goods, or passengers,</p><p>4.     Urgent,
time sensitive-deliveries,</p><p>5.     Transporting more than 3
passengers, including employees of the employer,</p><p>6.     Driving beyond a 30 mile
radius from the minor’s place of employment,</p><p>7.     More than two trips away
from the primary place of employment in any single day to deliver the
employer’s goods to a customer (other than urgent, time-sensitive deliveries
which are prohibited), or</p><p>8.     More than two trips away
from the primary place of employment in any single day to transport passengers,
other than employees of the employer, and</p><p>h.     Such driving is only
occasional and incidental to the minor’s employment.  This means that the youth
may spend no more than one-third of the worktime in any workday and no more
than 20 percent of the worktime in any workweek driving.</p><p>(e)   <b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  Ambulance attendants</p><p>Minors 16 and 17 years of age who have completed
the necessary training as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and are employed
as qualified ambulance attendants are not “outside helpers” within the meaning
of HO 2 and may ride in the rear of the ambulance while attending the patient
being transported.</p><p>(2)  Cart caddy</p><p>The operation of battery operated “cart caddy”
machines used by grocery stores to move large strings of shopping carts back to
the front area of the store would be a permissible occupation for minors 16 and
17 years of age.  This machine is not considered a “motor vehicle” and does not
fall within the scope of HO 2.  However, as it is a power-driven machine, its
use by 14- and 15-year-olds is prohibited under CL Reg 3.</p><p>(3)  Golf carts and riding
mowers</p><p>a.     Golf carts, riding
mowers, and similar motorized vehicles fall within the scope of HO 2 if used as
a means of transportation on public roads.  Because these motorized vehicles
are not “automobiles or trucks, operation of such vehicles would not fall under
the limited exemption contained in FLSA § 13(c)(6).</p><p>b.     There are certain
situations where a public road traverses a golf course or other establishments
where motorized vehicles are used off the roadway.  It may be necessary for
golf carts, riding mowers, or other motorized vehicles to cross the public road
in order to reach a particular work site or return to the club house.  Although
a strict interpretation of HO 2 would prohibit those under 18 years of age from
driving the carts and mowers across public roads, WH will not assert a
violation of HO 2 if the contact with the public road involves only the
crossing of that road, and such crossings occur only at marked cross walks and
pathways.</p><p>(4)  Messengers </p><p>Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may, under certain
conditions, be employed as messengers and errand boys/girls by firms other than
public messenger services to pick up and deliver messages or packages in
passenger type vehicles operated by someone other than the minor (see
FOH 33c(19)(b), see also § 570.34(o)).</p>

              <h3>33h03.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 3—Coal Mine Occupations.</h3>
              <p>Name: 
Coal Mine Occupations</p><p>Originally
Adopted:  September 1, 1940</p><p>(a) <b>Scope of HO 3</b></p><p>(1)  The report that established HO 3 found accident rates
(including death and dismemberment) for adults employed in and about coal mines
far exceed accident rates in other industries.  This report did not address
long term occupational illnesses such as “black lung.”  As of the last census
before the report was issued (1930), three per cent of workers employed in coal
mines were under the age of eighteen (approximately 16,000 minors).  Typically,
if employed underground, the young people worked as “miner’s helpers” loading
coal, or as “trappers” or “door boys” opening and closing doors (regulating air
flow) to allow the passage of coal cars.  If employed above ground, they worked
as slate pickers, as helpers in repair shops, or in general clean up work.  The
report concluded that the risk of injury to youths employed in coal mines was
great due to the rate of accidents involving adults, and due to their lack of
experience and good judgment.</p><p>(2)  HO 3 is industry specific.  Its scope includes all
types of work performed in or about an underground mine, an open-pit (strip)
mine, or at the surface part of the mining plant that contributes to the
extraction, grading, cleaning, or other handling of coal.  The scope of this
order does not cover slate or refuse picking at certain designated areas, and
work solely in offices, or in repair and maintenance shops located in the
surface area of any coal-mining plant.</p><p>(3)  Definitions</p><p>a.    
Coal shall mean any rank of coal,
including lignite, bituminous, and anthracite coals.</p><p>1.    
Lignite coal is a brownish-black
coal intermediate between peat and bituminous coal.</p><p>2.    
Bituminous coal is of medium age
(geologically).  It is “soft” and after burning it leaves bitumen—a tar like
substance.  It makes up the majority of the coal reserves in the United States.</p><p>3.    
Anthracite coal is the oldest coal
(geologically).  It is “hard” and burns clean.  It is found almost exclusively
in Pennsylvania.</p><p>b.    
The term occupation in or about
any coal mine shall mean all types of work performed in any underground
working, open-pit, or surface part of any coal mining plant, that contribute to
the extraction, grading, cleaning, or other handling of coal.</p><p>c.    
The term tipple refers to a place
where, or an apparatus by which, cars of coal are loaded or emptied.</p><p>(b) <b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  All work in underground coal mines, such as:  miner,
miner’s helper, loader, shearing-machine operator, loading-machine operator,
driller, shot firer, motorman, trackman, or timberman, etc.</p><p>(2)  All work in an open pit coal mine, such as:  miner,
shovel operator, electrician, etc.</p><p>(3)  All work on the surface part of an underground or
open-pit mine (or mining plant) except that permitted in FOH 33h03(c).</p><p>(c) <b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY BANNED</b></p><p>On
the surface part of the coal mining plant, 16 and 17 year olds may:</p><p>(1)  Engage in slate or other refuse picking at a picking
table, or at a picking chute in a tipple or a breaker.</p><p>(2)  Engage in occupations where the work occurs solely in offices,
or in repair or maintenance shops (which are located above ground).</p><p>(d) <b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  Stock clerk working on the premises of a coal mine  </p><p>This
occupation is prohibited for 16- or 17-year-olds if it involves moving about
the mine premises delivering supplies, crossing railroad tracks, being in the
vicinity of loading chutes, or otherwise working outside of the warehouse. 
Conversely, this work is permitted if it is confined solely to the warehouse
structure on the surface part of the mining plant.</p><p>(2)  Motor-vehicle operator and outside helper</p><p>HO 3
prohibits almost all work in or about a mine, which would include the
occupations of motor-vehicle driver and outside helper.  HO 2 also specifically
prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from performing the occupations of motor-vehicle
driver and outside helper in or about any mine, including open pit mine or
quarry.  </p><p>(3)  Cleaning under a coal tipple or breaker</p><p>This
work is prohibited by HO 3, as is the pining of railroad cars onto the main
spur track, and the cleaning of railroad cars.</p><p>(4)  Watchman</p><p>HO 3
prohibits 16 or 17 year olds from working as watchmen if they work in or about
the surface part of the mining operation (i.e., working around
railroad tracks, loading chutes, etc.).  However, if the area where the work is
performed is sufficiently removed (one mile or more) from the site of the
mining operation, then it would not be work “in or about a mine,” and such work
would be permissible for 16 and 17 year olds.  For example, 16 or 17 year olds
may work as watchmen at the front gate of the mine, or at an office, if they
are located more than one mile from the site of the mining operation.</p><p>(5)  Surveying</p><p>Surveying
work to plan future mining fields that is done well in advance of any mining
operation and at least one mile from current mining operations is not work in
the “surface part of any coal mining plant.”  Consequently, such work is
permitted for 16- and 17-year-olds.</p><p>(6)  Screening Coal</p><p>The
screening of coal is an occupation prohibited by HO 3.</p><p>(e) <b>Exemptions</b></p><p>There
are no provisions in HO 3 for apprentices or student-learners.  There are no
other exemptions applicable to this order.  </p>

              <h3>33h04 . HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 4—Forestry Occupations, Logging and
Sawmilling.</h3>
              <p>Name:  Forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention occupations,
timber tract occupations, forestry service occupations, logging occupations,
and occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or
cooperage stock mill. </p><p>Originally Adopted:  August 1, 1941</p><p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 4</b></p><p>(1)  The many accidents and injuries in logging made it the
most hazardous manufacturing industry at the time of the original order. 
Sawmilling ranked second.  This was based on both the frequency with which
accidents occurred as well as the severity of the resulting injuries.  A
December 1994 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
Alert – Request for Assistance in Preventing Injuries and Deaths of Loggers –
confirmed the earlier finding of the risks involved in logging.  During the period
from 1980-1989, the National Traumatic Occupational Fatalities Surveillance
System reported 1,492 deaths of workers in the logging industry, resulting in
an annual fatality rate more than 20 times that for all workers (164 deaths per
100,000 workers compared with 7 per 100,000 for all workers).  Most of these
deaths occurred in four occupational groups:  logging occupations (for example,
fellers, limbers, buckers, and choker setters), truck drivers, general
laborers, and material machine operators. </p><p>(2)  HO 4 prohibits, with a few exceptions, the performance
of all occupations in the logging industry, in sawmills, lath mills, and
cooperage-stock mills.  HO 4 was amended several times and new sections were
added during World War II (on September 11, 1942, and June 24, 1943), to permit
the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds in saw filing and certain occupations in
logging for the duration of the war and six months afterwards. </p><p>(3)  On February 2, 1948, and again on April 15, 1967, HO 4
was revised to permit 16- and 17-year-olds to perform specific tasks in
logging, logging camps, and outside shake and shingle mills. </p><p>(4)  The Department of Labor Appropriations Act, 2004 (PL
108-199) amended the FLSA by creating a limited exemption from the child labor
provisions for minors 14 to 18 years of age who are excused from compulsory
school attendance beyond the eighth grade.  </p><p>a.    
The exemption, contained in §
13(c)(7) of the FLSA, allows eligible youth to be employed by businesses that
use machinery to process wood products, but does not allow such youth to
operate or assist in operating power-driven woodworking machines.  </p><p>b.    
The provisions of FLSA § 13(c)(7)
impact CL Reg 3 (see FOH 33c01) and HO 4 (see
FOH 33h04(d)).  A Final Rule was published on May 20, 2010 (see 75 FR
28404) that incorporated the provisions of the amended § 13(c)(7) by revising
subparts C and E of 29 CFR part 570.</p><p>(5)  The 2010 Final Rule (see 75 FR 28429) also expanded HO
4 to prohibit most work in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention,
timber tract occupations, and forestry service operations (see 29 CFR 570.54).</p><p>(6)  Definitions</p><p>a.    
the term all occupations in forest
fire fighting and forest fire prevention shall include the controlling and
extinguishing of fires, the wetting down of areas or extinguishing of spot
fires, and the patrolling of burned areas to assure the fire has been extinguished. 
The term shall also include the following tasks when performed in conjunction
with, or in support of, efforts to extinguish a forest fire:  the piling and
burning of slash; the clearing of fire trails or roads; the construction,
maintenance, and patrolling of fire lines; acting as a fire lookout or fire
patrolman; and the maintaining of fire fighting equipment.  The prohibition against
the employment of youth in forest fire fighting and fire prevention applies to
all forest and timber tract locations, logging operations, and sawmill
operations, including all buildings located within such areas.</p><p>b.    
The term all occupations in
forestry services shall mean all work involved in the support of timber
production, wood technology, forestry economics and marketing, and forest
protection.  The term includes such services as timber cruising, surveying, or
logging-engineering parties; estimating timber; timber valuation; forest pest
control; forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention as defined in this section;
and reforestation.  The term shall not include work in forest nurseries,
establishments primarily engaged in growing trees for purposes of
reforestation.  The term shall not include the gathering of forest products
such as balsam needles, ginseng, huckleberry greens, maple sap, moss, Spanish
moss, sphagnum moss, teaberries, and tree seeds; the distillation of gum,
turpentine, and rosin if carried on at the gum farm; and the extraction of pine
gum.</p><p>c.    
The term all occupations in
logging shall mean all work performed in conjunction with the felling of
timber; the bucking or converting of timber into logs, poles, piles, ties,
bolts, pulpwood, chemical wood, excelsior wood, cordwood, fence posts, or
similar products; the collecting, skidding, yarding, loading, transporting and
unloading of such products in connection with logging; the constructing,
repairing and maintaining of roads, railroads, flumes, or camps used in
connection with logging; and other work performed in connection with logging. </p><p>d.    
The term all occupations in the
operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage-stock mill
shall mean all work performed in or about any such mill in connection with
storing of logs and bolts; converting logs or bolts into sawn lumber, laths,
shingles, or cooperage stock, or other products of such mills; and other work
performed in connection with the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle
mill, or cooperage-stock mill.  The term shall not include work performed in
the planing-mill department or other remanufacturing departments of any
sawmill, or in any planing-mill or remanufacturing plant not a part of a
sawmill (This work could be prohibited under HO 5 if the minor operated
power-driven wood working machines).</p><p>e.    
The term all occupations in timber
tracts means all work performed in or about establishments that cultivate,
manage or sell standing timber.  The term includes work performed in timber
culture, timber tracts, timber-stand improvement, and forest fire fighting and
fire prevention.  It includes work on tree farms, except those tree farm
establishments that meet the definition of agriculture contained in 29 U.S.C.
203(f). </p><p>f.     
The terms remanufacturing plant
and remanufacturing departments as used in (d) above refer to those
manufacturing departments of a sawmill where lumber products such as boxes,
lawn furniture, and the like are re-manufactured from previously cut lumber. 
The kind of work performed in a remanufacturing plant or department is similar
to that done in the planing-mill department in that rough lumber is surfaced or
made into other finished products.  The term is not intended to denote those
operations in a sawmill where rough lumber is cut to dimensions.  The mere
cutting of rough wood into smaller size pieces would not constitute
remanufacturing under HO 4.</p><p>(b)

Clerical work in yards or shipping
sheds, such as done by order-men, tallymen, and shipping clerks.</p><p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p><p>(1)  There is no provision in HO 4 for apprentices or
student-learners.  The logging section of the order was reviewed in 1974 in
response to a request for a student-learner exemption in logging operations. 
It was determined that the industry had not substantially changed, the hazards
remained the same, and the request was denied.  </p><p>(2)  FLSA § 13(c)(7) – Employment of Certain Minors in
Places of Business That Use Machinery to Process Wood Products.</p><p>a.    
The Department of Labor
Appropriations Act of 2004 amended the FLSA by creating a limited exemption
from the child labor provisions for certain minors 14 to 18 years old which
allows them to be employed inside and outside places of businesses that use
machinery to process wood products (such as sawmills, furniture manufacturers,
cabinet makers, garden shed and gazebo manufacturers, and pallet shops).  </p><p>b.    
With regard to such
establishments, this amendment overrides the general CL Reg 3 prohibitions
regarding the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing occupations,
processing occupations, and in work places where goods are manufactured or
processed.  It also overrides the HO 4 prohibition regarding the employment of
youth in occupations that entail entering the sawmill building.  This
exemption, however, does not excuse compliance with the remaining CL Reg 3
occupations standards and all of the CL Reg 3 hours standards in regards to the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds; nor does it excuse compliance with the
provisions of all of the other HOs in regards to the employment of youths aged
14 through 17 (see § 570.34(m)(2)).</p><p>c.    
Under this exemption, contained at
FLSA § 13(c)(7), an eligible youth is one who is under the age of 18 and at
least the age of 14 who by statute or judicial order is exempt from compulsory
school attendance beyond the eighth grade.  In addition, the youth must be
supervised on the job by an adult relative or by an adult of the same religious
sect or division as the youth.</p><p>1.    
An adult
is someone who has reached his or her eighteenth birthday. </p><p>2.    
A
relative, for purposes of this exemption, includes at a minimum a parent or
person standing in place of a parent, a grandparent, an aunt or uncle, or a
sibling.</p><p>3.    
Such
supervision must be close, direct, constant, and uninterrupted (see 29
CFR 570.54(b)). </p><p>d.    
Such minors are still prohibited
from operating or assisting in the operation of power-driven woodworking
machines by virtue of § 13(c)(7) and HO 5.  Power-driven
woodworking machines include all fixed or portable machines or tools driven by
power and used or designed for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing,
stapling, wire stitching, fastening or otherwise assembling, pressing or
printing wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber (see FOH 33h05(a)(5)a.). </p><p>e.    
In addition, the employer must
ensure that the minors are protected from wood particles or other flying
debris within the work place by a barrier appropriate to the potential
hazard of such wood particles or flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient
distance from machinery in operation.  The minors must also use personal
protective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive levels of noise
and saw dust. Compliance with these provisions will be accomplished when the
employer is in compliance with the requirements of the applicable governing
standards issued by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) or, in those states where OSHA has authorized the
state to operate its own Occupational Safety and Health Plan, the applicable
standards issued by the Office charged with administering the State Occupations
Safety and Health Plan.</p><p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  Veneer mills</p><p>Veneer
mills expose minors to similar, if not identical, hazards that are present in
sawmills –
saws, sharp blades, heavy logs, hoisting apparatus, cranes, forklifts, as well
as dust and noise pollution.  Veneer mills are treated the same as sawmills
under HO 4. </p><p>(2)  Firewood</p><p>Cutting
and splitting logs and the collecting, stacking, and loading of firewood are
considered “converting of timber into pulpwood, cordwood, or similar products”
and therefore this work is prohibited by HO 4 (see WHD Director A.W. Motley's
letter of May 20, 1959).  The prohibition against the employment of youth under
18 years of age to cut, split, collect, stack, and load firewood applies to all
covered employment—not just work in forestry, sawmilling, or logging.</p><p>(3)  Power-driven wood chipping machines</p><p>Occupations in
connection with the operation of wood chipping machines when used in the woods
in logging operations would be subject to the 18-year minimum age under both HO
4 and HO 14.  Child labor violations involving wood chipping machines, in any
nonagricultural occupation or industry, will be recorded as being a violation
of HO 14.</p><p>(4)  Stump removal</p><p>Stump pulling using
tractors in nonagricultural situations is not subject to HO 4.</p><p>(5)  Christmas trees</p><p>An ordinary
household-sized Christmas tree is not considered to be timber, nor is it cut
into log lengths or converted into lumber products—therefore, HO 4 does not
apply (see Director of Children's Bureau Industrial Division McConnell's letter
of October 29, 1942).</p><p>(6)  Clearing right-of-way for power lines, highways</p><p>Activities in
connection with the clearing of a right-of-way would not be within the scope of
HO 4 since these are not logging operations.  HO 4 does not cover the clearing
of land in preparation for highway construction (see Regional Solicitor Barnes'
memorandum of June 25, 1959). </p>

              <h3>33h05.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 5—Power-Driven Woodworking Machine Operations.</h3>
              <p>Name:     Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven
wood-working machines.</p><p>Originally Adopted:  August 1, 1941</p><p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 5</b></p><p>(1)  Power-driven woodworking machines are among the most
hazardous of all machine tools. Although great strides have been made by
manufacturers and OSHA to improve the safety of such machines through design
changes and guarding, the risk of injury to operators or workers assisting to
operate such machines has not been eliminated.  Several hazardous factors are
inherent to woodworking machines—extremely high speeds of operation, sharpness
of cutting tools, and the lightness of material being cut making “kick-backs”
possible.  The fact that many woodworking machines are hand fed increases the
hazards.    </p><p>(2)  This order is very broad in scope and is applied on a
machine basis.  Basically, if a minor, while performing covered employment, is
operating, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and/or cleaning a
power-driven wood working machine, HO 5 most likely applies.</p><p>(3)  HO 5 does not apply when the machinery or tools are
designed to be used, and are used exclusively, on materials other than
wood—such as metal, plastic or stone.  Another HO (such as HO 8, 14, 16 or 17)
may prohibit such work.</p><p>(4)  HO 5 applies in any industries where power-driven
woodworking tools are used—including furniture plants; sawmills, cabinet makers
and other woodworking plants and shops; construction sites; packing sheds;
retail and service establishments such as hardware and lumber stores; state and
local government entities; and other industries which use power-driven
woodworking machines, but which may not directly manufacture wood products.  Even
though FLSA § 13(c)(7) exempts certain minors 14 to 17 years of age from
the HO 4 prohibition concerning the performance of work that entails entering a
sawmill building, the HO 5 prohibitions regarding operating and assisting to
operate power-driven woodworking machines are applicable to the employment of
those youth who may now legally work in a sawmill.</p><p>(5)  Definitions</p><p>a.    
The term power-driven woodworking
machine shall mean all fixed or portable machines or tools driven by power and
used or designed for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing, stapling,
wire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing, or printing wood,
veneer, trees, logs, or lumber.  This definition is broad and includes machines
used at the time the order was issued as well as all power-driven woodworking
machines developed in subsequent years.  It may also apply to multiple-use
woodworking machines as well as those designed for a single woodworking
purpose.  A machine that was designed to be used on wood is prohibited by HO 5
even when used to cut, shape, form, etc., a material other than wood.</p><p>b.    
The term driven by power shall
mean machines driven by electrical, animal, mechanical, water, or other power
such as steam or hydraulic.  It also includes battery-operated and pneumatic-operated
machines and tools, but does not apply to machines or tools driven by foot or
hand power, such as foot-powered jig saws or hand-operated saws or drills.</p><p>c.    
The term off-bearing shall mean
the removal of material or refuse directly from a saw table or from the point
of operation.  Operations not considered as off-bearing within the intent of HO
5 include:</p><p>1.    
The removal of material or refuse
from a circular saw or guillotine-action veneer clipper where the material or
refuse has been conveyed away from the saw table or point of operation by a
gravity chute or by some mechanical means such as a moving belt or expulsion
roller, and</p><p>2.    
The following operations when they
do not involve the removal of material or refuse directly from a saw or from
the point of operation:</p><p>A.   
The carrying, moving, or
transporting of materials from one machine to another or from one part of a
plant to another,</p><p>B.   
The piling, stacking, or arranging
of materials for feeding into a machine by another person, and</p><p>C.   
The sorting, tying, bundling or
loading of materials.</p><p>(6)  The following examples of power-driven machines and
tools, when used for “cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing, stapling,
wire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing, or printing wood,
veneer, trees, logs, or lumber” are subject to HO 5.  This list is not
all-inclusive – other machines exist or may be developed which meet the
definition of power-driven woodworking machines:</p><p>a.    
Cutting – circular saw, band saw,
jig saw, drag saw, chain saw, veneer clipper.</p><p>b.    
Shaping and forming – shaper,
molder, heel turner, lathe, tenoner, mortiser, sticker, drill, boring machine,
hole cutter.</p><p>c.    
Surfacing – planer, jointer,
sander, barker.</p><p>d.    
Nailing – nailer, box nailer,
cleat nailer, roofing gun, drywall gun (when used to attach drywall to wood
studs), siding gun, finishing nail gun.</p><p>e.    
Stapling – stapler.</p><p>f.     
Wire stitching – wire stitcher,
berry-basket machine, bushel-tub machine.</p><p>g.    
Fastening, or otherwise assembling
– corrugator or other similar type machine for fastening two pieces of wood
together by means of a metallic fastener of some type.</p><p>h.    
Pressing – veneer press, boxboard
squeezer, and printing press used on wood.</p><p>(7)  HO 5 prohibits minors from operating power-driven
woodworking equipment in sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, and cooperage
stock mills—industries that are covered by HO 4.  HO 5 (rather than HO 4)
applies to the planing-mill department or other re-manufacturing departments of
these enterprises when contained in buildings separate from the sawmill, lath
mill, shingle mill or cooperage stock mill.  HO 5 also applies to the
employment of minors between the ages of 14 and 17 who, although now permitted
to work in sawmills because of the exemption contained in FLSA § 13(c)(7),
are found to have operated or assisted in the operation of, power-driven
woodworking machines.</p><p>(8)  Guards.  The fact that a machine is guarded has no
effect on the application of HO 5.  Woodworking machines are the most difficult
to guard and guards alone cannot be relied upon to protect minors from the
hazards of woodworking machines. </p><p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the
occupation of operating power-driven woodworking machines, including
supervising or controlling the operation of such machines, feeding material
into such machines, and helping the operator to feed material into such
machines.</p><p>a.    
The occupations of operating
woodworking machines includes starting and stopping the machine, adjusting for
the type of work being performed, and placing the wood stock on the machine. 
Machines may be automatic, hand fed or power-fed. </p><p>b.    
HO 5 does not prohibit these
minors from placing materials on a moving chain or in a hopper or slide for
automatic feeding.</p><p>(2)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the
occupation of setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning
power-driven woodworking machines.</p><p>(3)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the
occupation of off-bearing (unloading materials) from circular saws when the
material is not conveyed away from the machine by some mechanical means.</p><p>(4)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the
occupation of off-bearing (unloading materials) from guillotine-action veneer
clippers when the material is not conveyed away from the point of operation by
a moving belt or gravity chain.</p><p>(5)  The following is a partial list of power-driven
woodworking machines prohibited by HO 5. This equipment may be stationary or
portable and may be powered by batteries:</p><p>a.     Band saws.</p><p>b.     Circular saws (table saws, swing
saws, portable saws, etc.).</p><p>c.

Carrying or moving material from
one machine to another or otherwise handling or shipping veneer.</p><p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions </b></p><p>HO 5 does provide an exemption for apprentices and student-learners. 
There are no other exemptions applicable.  </p><p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  Chain saws</p><p>HO 14 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from operating chain
saws—regardless of the material being processed.  HO 5 also prohibits the
operation of chain saws to cut wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber because
chain saws, when used as such, are “power-driven woodworking machines”.  HO 4
also prohibits the use of chain saws by minors in logging and sawmilling
operations.</p><p>(2)  Power-driven machines used to cut materials other than
wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber</p><p>a.    
HO 5 applies to any power-driven
machines used or designed for cutting or shaping wood, veneer, trees, logs, or
lumber—regardless of what material is cut by it.  </p><p>b.    
HO 5 does not prohibit minors from
operating machines designed and used exclusively to cut or shape plastic,
leather, or items other than wood.  HO 14, however, may prohibit minors from
using circular saws, band saws, guillotine shears, wood chippers, reciprocating
saws, chain saws, and abrasive cutting discs to cut these materials. </p><p>c.    
Certain machine tools are designed
to cut or shape metal.  These tools may have the same name as woodworking tools
and may share many characteristics of woodworking tools.  But if they are
designed to be used on metal, they are not subject to HO 5.  Such tools include
metal drills, lathes, planers, grinders, borers, etc. (see FOH
33h08 for a list of these machines).</p><p>(3)  The following situations were determined not to fall
under HO 5, mainly because the power-driven woodworking machines were not used
or designed to be used for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing,
stapling, wire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing or
printing wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber:</p><p>a.    
Operation of staple machines in
the upholstery department of furniture manufacturers, in boat yards or
automobile repair shops, when used to attach vinyl, plastic film, webbing
straps, velcro, plastic molding or fabric to a wooden or plastic seat.</p><p>b.    
Operation of drywall screw guns
when used only to attach drywall to metal studs.</p><p>c.    
Operation of belt sanders when the
sandpaper is designed for use on products other than wood.</p><p>d.    
Operation of rivet machines used
to attach hardware to other objects.</p><p>e.    
Operation of portable electric
drills used to bore holes in products other than wood, such as metal.</p><p>f.     
Operation of tumbler machines used
to polish wood products.</p><p>g.    
Operation of electric, pneumatic
and battery-operated screwdrivers which tighten screws but perform no work on
the wood itself.</p><p>h.    
Operation of routers designed to
be used on metal and used to finish metal countertops and other products not
made of wood (HO 8 does not apply to metal routers).</p>

              <h3>33h06.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 6—Radioactive Substances.</h3>
              <p>Name:  Hazardous Occupations Order 6—Exposure to
Radioactive Substances and to Ionizing </p><p>Radiations. </p><p>                        Originally
Adopted:  May 1, 1942</p><p>(a)           
Scope of HO 6</p><p>(1)          
Many deaths from radiation
poisoning were reported in 1929.  A number of these cases involved young women
who were engaged in manufacturing luminous compounds.  Their exposure to radiation
began before they were 18 years of age.  The hazards of radiation exposure have
been found to be greater for young persons since they are less likely to
exercise care to avoid contamination.  Moreover, according to the Occupational
Safety and Health Division of the National Institute of Science and Technology,
several studies have shown that radiation exposure caused more injury to
rapidly growing and dividing cells than to mature cells.  The significant
health risk connected with exposing young people to radiation is highlighted by
the fact that OSHA has recognized this risk by making it its only age specific
standard.</p><p>(2)          
HO 6 was issued to protect people
under the age of 18 from exposure to radiation in the workplace and it applies
to manufacturing plants, storage facilities, hospitals, clinics, laboratories,
dental offices, colleges and universities, and all other covered locations
where there are X-ray machines or other sources of radiation contamination.</p><p>(3)          
HO 6 was issued before the
development of atomic energy as a weapon during World War II and later as an
energy source.  Consequently, HO 6 does not address problems related to
exposure to atomic energy.  Workers are protected from such hazards by
regulations issued and enforced by the Department of Energy.</p><p>(4)          
HO 6 adopted as its tolerance to
the exposure to radioactive substance in the air the occupational standards
established by the National Committee on Radiation Protection.   This tolerance
was set forth in the National Bureau of Standards Handbook No. 69 entitled:
Maximum Permissible Body Burdens and Maximum Permissible Concentrations of
Radionuclides in Air and in Water for Occupational Exposure.  The rules on
annual intake of radiation were changed in 1993, and the maximum permissible
concentrations in the air for exposure have been replaced by what is known as
the “derived air concentration.”  These requirements, which do not apply to
naturally formed radiation or to medical radiation, are found in 10 CFR part
20, Standards for Protection Against Radiation.</p><p>(5)          
Definitions</p><p>a.             
The term self-luminous compound
shall mean any mixture of phosphorescent material and radium, mesothorium, or
other radioactive element.</p><p>b.             
The term workroom shall include
the entire area bounded by walls of solid material and extending from floor to
ceiling.</p><p>c.             
The term ionizing radiation shall
mean alpha and beta particles, electrons, protons, neutrons, gamma and X-ray
and all other radiations which produce ionizations directly or indirectly, but
does not include electromagnetic radiations other than gamma and X-ray.</p><p>(b)           
Occupations PROHIBITED</p><p>(1)          
Any work in any workroom in which:</p><p>a.             
Radium is stored or used in the
manufacture of self-luminous compound,</p><p>b.             
Self-luminous compound is made,
processed or packaged,</p><p>c.             
Self-luminous compound is stored,
used or worked on,</p><p>d.             
Incandescent mantles are made from
fabric and solutions containing thorium salts, or are processed or packaged, or</p><p>e.             
Other radioactive substances are
present in the air in average concentrations exceeding 10 percent of the
maximum permissible concentrations in the air recommended for occupational
exposure by the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Exposure, as set
forth in 10 CFR 20.1207.</p><p>(2)          
Any other work which involves
exposure to ionizing radiation in excess of 0.5 rem per year.</p><p>(c)           
Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED   </p><p>(1)          
Work in medical facilities such as
X-ray rooms and laboratories where exposure to ionizing radiation is less than
0.5 rem per year.  </p><p>(2)          
Work involving exposure to
naturally-occurring radiation such as radiation in soil or sunlight radiation.</p><p>(d)           
Exemptions </p><p>There
are no provisions in HO 6 for apprentices or student-learners.  There are no
other exemptions applicable to this order.  </p><p>(e)           
Enforcement positions</p><p>(1)          
Compliance with the National
Committee on Radiation Protection updates and clarifications of Handbook No.
69, including compliance with the standards of 10 CFR part 20, is considered
compliance with the radiation exposure requirements of HO 6.</p><p>(2)          
Although HO 6 still applies, the
manufacture of products containing radium and radium compounds used to make
self-luminous parts, such as but not limited to watch dials that glow at night,
is no longer a problem.  This type of manufacturing was discontinued a number
of years ago and seldom are any products manufactured using such lumination. 
With regard to thorium salts used to make incandescent gas mantles such as
those used on Coleman Lanterns, this also is no longer an exposure problem. 
The radiation level is so low on each mantle that one would have to concentrate
hundreds of these mantles together to achieve an exposure level even
approaching a health risk. </p>

              <h3>33h07.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 7—Power-Driven Hoisting Apparatus
Occupations.</h3>
              <p>Name: 
Occupations Involved in the Operation of Power-driven Hoisting Apparatus</p><p>Originally
Adopted:  July 16, 1946</p><p>(a)           
Scope of HO 7</p><p>(1)          
The investigation of occupations
involved in the operation of hoisting apparatus was initiated because of the
generally accepted belief that such equipment presented a high degree of
accident risk and was inappropriate for young workers.  Accidents have involved
improper rigging where loads have fallen on people and crushed them; persons
falling from stacked materials or down elevator shafts; and people coming into
contact with over-head electrical conductors.  These injuries not only occurred
during the operation of the equipment, but also while assisting in the
operation of hoisting apparatus.  </p><p>(2)          
HO 7 originally prohibited 16- and
17-year-olds from operating (or, in some cases assisting to operate) all
power-driven hoisting apparatus which consist of elevators, cranes, derricks,
hoists and high-lift trucks and portable elevators, and tiering or piling
machines.  HO 7 is broadly written and prohibits the operation of this
equipment no matter where located.</p><p>(3)          
Revisions to HO 7 in 2010 (see FOH
33h07(b); 75 FR 28433) more broadly prohibited 16- and 17-year-olds from
operating, tending, riding upon, working from, repairing, servicing, or
disassembling such equipment.</p><p>(4)          
Definitions</p><p>a.             
The term elevator shall mean any
power-driven hoisting or lowering mechanism equipped with a car or platform
which moves in guides in a substantially vertical direction.  This term
includes both passenger and freight elevators (including portable elevators or
tiering machines), but shall not include dumbwaiters.</p><p>b.             
The term automatic elevator shall
mean a passenger elevator, a freight elevator, or a combination
passenger-freight elevator, the operation of which is controlled by pushbuttons
in such a manner that the starting, going to the landing selected, leveling and
holding, and the opening and closing of the car and hoistway doors are entirely
automatic.</p><p>c.             
The term automatic signal
operation elevator shall mean an elevator which is started in response to the
operation of a switch (such as a lever or pushbutton) in the car which when
operated by the operator actuates a starting device that automatically closes
the car and hoistway doors—from this point on, the movement of the car to the
landing selected, leveling and holding when it gets there, and the opening of
the car and hoistway doors are entirely automatic.</p><p>d.             
The term crane shall mean a
power-driven machine for lifting and lowering a load and moving it
horizontally, in which the hoisting mechanism is an integral part of the
machine.  This term includes all types of cranes, such as cantilever gantry,
crawler, gantry, hammerhead, ingot pouring, jib, locomotive, motor-truck,
overhead traveling, pillar jib, pintle, portal, semi-gantry, semi-portal,
storage bridge, tower, walking jib, and wall cranes.</p><p>e.             
The term derrick shall mean a
power-driven apparatus consisting of a mast or equivalent members held at the
top by guys or braces, with or without a boom, for use with a hoisting
mechanism or operating ropes.  This term includes all types of derricks, such
as A-frame, breast, Chicago boom, gin-pole, guy and stiff-leg derrick.</p><p>f.              
The term hoist shall mean a
power-driven apparatus for raising or lowering a load by the application of a
pulling force that does not include a car or platform running in guides.  This
term includes all types of hoists, such as base mounted electric, clevis
suspension, hook suspension, monorail, overhead electric, simple drum and
trolley suspension hoists.</p><p>g.             
The term high-lift truck shall
mean a power-driven industrial type of truck used for lateral transportation
that is equipped with a power-operated lifting device usually in the form of a
fork or platform capable of tiering loaded pallets or skids one above the
other.  Instead of a fork or a platform, the lifting device may consist of a
ram, scoop, shovel, crane, revolving fork, or other attachments for handling
specific loads.  The term shall mean and include highlift trucks known under
such names as fork lifts, fork trucks, fork lift trucks, tiering trucks,
backhoes, front-end loaders, skid loaders, skid-steer loaders, Bobcat loaders,
or stacking trucks, but shall not mean low-lift trucks or low-lift platform
trucks that are designed for the transportation of but not the tiering of
materials.</p><p>h.             
The term manlift shall mean a
device intended for the conveyance of persons that consists of platforms or
brackets mounted on, or attached to, an endless belt, cable, chain or similar
method of suspension; with such belt, cable or chain operating in a
substantially vertical direction and being supported by and driven through
pulleys, sheaves or sprockets at the top and bottom.  The term shall also
include truck- or equipment-mounted aerial platforms commonly referred to as
scissor lifts, boom-type mobile elevating work platforms, work assist vehicles,
cherry pickers, basket hoists, and bucket trucks.</p><p>i.              
The term regular operator shall
mean a person whose regular and practical duty is the operation of the
elevator.  </p><p>j.              
The term assigned operator shall
mean a person who has been specifically designated to operate the elevator. 
Such a person may be a “regular” operator.  Assigned operator may also mean a
person who is designated to operate the elevator in addition to his/her regular
job.  More than one person may be assigned to operate the same elevator.</p><p>(b)           
Occupations PROHIBITED</p><p>(1)          
Work of operating, tending, riding
upon, working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling an elevator, crane,
derrick, hoist, or high-lift truck, except 16- and 17-year-olds may operate or
ride inside an unattended automatic operation passenger elevator. Tending such
equipment includes assisting in the hoisting tasks being performed by the
equipment.</p><p>(2)          
Work of operating, tending, riding
upon, working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a manlift or freight
elevator, except 16- and 17-year-olds may ride upon a freight elevator operated
by an assigned operator.  Tending such equipment includes assisting in the
hoisting tasks being performed by the equipment.  CL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and
15-year-olds from operating most power-driven equipment, including “automatic”
freight elevators and automatic combination passenger/freight elevators.  Such
youth may operate and ride in fully automatic passenger elevators as found in
most office buildings.</p><p>(3)          
Operator of a portable elevator or
tiering machine.</p><p>(4)          
Operator of a crane or derrick.</p><p>(5)          
Tending, riding upon, working
from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a crane or derrick, including such
work as performed by crane hookers, crane chasers, hookers-on, riggers, rigger
helpers, and the like.  </p><p>a.             
Tending such equipment includes
assisting in the hoisting tasks being performed by the equipment.  </p><p>b.             
Members of an oil-well drilling
crew are considered as assisting in the operation of such equipment (see
FOH 33h07(e)(4)).  </p><p>(6)          
Operating, tending, riding upon,
working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a hoist—including hoists
that do not exceed one-ton capacity.  </p><p>a.             
Prior to July 19, 2010, 16- and
17-year-olds were permitted to operate certain electric or air-operated hoists
that did not exceed a one ton capacity (see 75 FR 28433).  </p><p>b.             
This prohibition includes hoists
commonly used on tow trucks.   HO 2 prohibits minors from operating a motor
vehicle while towing another vehicle.</p><p>(7)          
Operating, tending riding upon,
working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a high-lift truck such as
a forklift, fork truck, fork-lift truck, tiering truck, backhoe, front end
loader, skid loader, skid-steer loader, stacking truck and a Bobcat loader.  </p><p>a.             
Prior to July 19, 2010, HO 7 only prohibited
the work of operating a high-lift truck.  The 2010 Final Rule added the tasks
of tending, riding upon, working from, repairing, servicing, and disassembling
such equipment.</p><p>b.             
“Tending” includes assisting in
the hoisting tasks being performed by the equipment.  Minors under 18 years of
age may not be employed as “spotters” of forklifts—workers who provide signals
or cues to forklift operators to assist in the safe operation of forklifts—as
such work is “tending” (see 75 FR 28434).</p><p>c.             
The prohibitions of HO 7 apply
even if the minors operating such equipment do not use or activate the
equipment’s hoisting apparatus.  </p><p>1.             
For example, in Lynnville
Transport, Inc. v. Chao, 316 F. Supp.2d 790 (S.D. Iowa 2004), the District
Court affirmed DOL’s position that minors who operated a skid loader as a
“scraper” to muck-out a cattle transport vehicle were still employed in
violation of HO 7 even though they never raised or lowered the shovel (the
hoisting apparatus) of the equipment.  The court cited the administrative law
judge’s reasoning that “although the minors testified that they did not lift
the shovel of the skid loader to high levels in performing their duties, the
fact that they had the opportunity to do so, either intentionally or
unintentionally, by moving the levers, placed the minors and other minors in
the area in a potentially hazardous position.” (316 F.Supp.2nd at 800).  </p><p>2.             
This same reasoning would prohibit
minors from simply moving such power-driven hoisting equipment from one
location to another, such as around a job site or from the back of an equipment
dealer showroom to the front of the showroom.</p><p>(8)          
Work of operating, tending, riding
upon, working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a manlift.  The
definition of a manlift includes, since July 19, 2010, truck- or
equipment-mounted aerial platforms commonly referred to as scissor lifts,
boom-type mobile elevating work platforms, work assist vehicles, cherry
pickers, basket hoists, and bucket trucks.</p><p>(9)          
Operating, tending, riding upon,
working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a freight elevator, except
16- and 17-year-olds may ride on a freight elevator when the elevator is
operated by an assigned operator.</p><p>(c)           
Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</p><p>(1)          
Automotive and truck servicing
establishments</p><p>a.             
“Grease rack” lifts used in
gasoline service stations, tire stores and other establishments servicing
automobiles are not “power-driven hoisting apparatus” covered by HO 7.</p><p>b.             
Service jacks, hand jacks, air
compressors, tire changers, truck tire changers, and wheel balancers are all
outside the scope of HO 7.</p><p>(2)          
Operation of amusement park rides</p><p>a.             
The operation of amusement park
rides is not prohibited by HO 7.</p><p>b.             
Although a number of rides in
amusement and theme parks have characteristics similar to certain machines that
minors under 18 years of age are prohibited from operating under HO 7, a
careful review of these rides, which have a variety of names, has concluded
that none of the machines are “derricks<a name="OLE_LINK5">”</a>, “cranes”,
“hoists”, “elevators” or “manlifts” within the meaning of the HO.</p><p>1.             
Swing-type rides appear very
similar to a stiff-leg derrick or various types of cranes including a jib
crane.  However, these rides only swing or rotate and lack any hoisting
apparatus.</p><p>2.             
A number of roller coasters and
similar rides are connected cars operated on a rail and driven by a chain
pull.  They are not operated by hoists, nor are they considered elevators or
manlifts. </p><p>3.             
Water rides often follow the flow
of the water down a trough and are repositioned at a higher level by a conveyor
belt.  Since the boats carrying the riders remain within the trough, these
rides are not considered elevators or manlifts.</p><p>(3)          
Operation of motorized hand
trucks.  Motorized hand trucks, such as the Yale Low Lift Pallet-Walkie
Motorized Hand Truck, models MPW 040 and 060, are not considered to be
“high-lift trucks.”  Designed for transportation but not the tiering of
materials, they are low-lift trucks and not subject to HO 7. </p><p>(4)          
Hanglines in poultry processing
plants and dry cleaners are considered to be “chain conveyors” and are not
covered by HO 7.  These apparatus do not have hoists to raise and lower the
loads.</p><p>a.             
Hanglines in poultry processing
plants are usually made up of a metal I-beam, a continuous chain, and shackles
attached to the chain.  The chain may be powered by an electric motor or other
means and generally runs from the loading dock or platform, through the plant
were the poultry is processed and back to the loading dock in a continuous
loop.  Crews on the platform (or sometimes in a darkened room nearby) attach
the live poultry to the shackles by their feet where they hang upside down. 
The hangline then moves to the killing area within the plant and may in the
course of its route rise or descend within the plant to different levels.  The
speed of the chain is coordinated with the loading crew’s ability to hang a
fowl on each shackle and not leave any without a bird on it. HO 11, as of July
19, 2010, prohibits the employment of youth under 18 in most occupations in or
about poultry slaughtering and processing establishments.</p><p>b.             
Hanglines in dry cleaners that
hold finished garments to be picked up operate in a similar manner as the
hanglines in poultry processing plants.</p><p>(5)          
“Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART”  </p><p>a.             
The “Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART”
are two types of machines often used by grocers and other retail stores to move
large strings of shopping carts.  These machines are hooked to the last
shopping cart in a string and then the operator guides the string of carts back
to the store while commanding the machine to move by means of a hand-held
remote control.  The operator walks behind the machine and operates the manual
throttle when returning to the parking lot to collect more carts.  </p><p>b.             
These machines do not fall within
the definitions of any of the hoists prohibited by HO 7; nor are these machines
considered to be “motor vehicles” as defined in HO 2.  Sixteen- and 17-year-old
minors are permitted to operate these machines.</p><p>c.             
Since the “Cart Caddy” and
“QuicKART” are both power-driven machines, 29 CFR 570.33(b) would prohibit
14- and 15-year-olds from operating or tending such machines (see
FOH 33c06(e)(5)).  </p><p>(d)           
Exemptions</p><p>(1)          
There is no provision in HO 7 for
apprentices or student-learners.</p><p>(2)          
Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may
operate an automatic elevator and an automatic signal operation elevator
provided that all the following conditions have been met:</p><p>a.             
The exposed portion of the car
interior, the car door, and the hoistway doors are constructed of solid
surfaces without any opening through which a part of the body may extend,</p><p>b.             
All hoistway openings at floor
level have doors which are interlocked with the car door so as to prevent the
car from starting until all such doors are closed and locked,</p><p>c.             
The elevator is equipped with a
device which will stop and hold the car in case of overspeed or if the cable
slackens or breaks, and</p><p>d.             
The elevator is equipped with
upper and lower travel limit devices which will normally bring the car to rest
at either terminal and a final limit switch which will prevent the movement in
either direction and will open in case of excessive over travel by the car.</p><p>(e)           
Enforcement positions</p><p>(1)          
Chair-lifts at ski resorts</p><p>Chair-lifts
at ski resorts which operate in a substantially vertical direction – where the
lifts travel in a vertical direction that is greater than the horizontal
distance traveled – are manlifts subject to HO 7 and may not be operated by
minors under 18 years of age. Those chair-lifts which travel a greater distance
horizontally than vertically are outside the scope of HO 7.</p><p>(2)          
Airport baggage handling equipment</p><p>a.             
A conveyor belt loader is a
wheeled vehicle, equipped with a movable conveyor belt, used to load and unload
individual baggage items from the cargo hold of aircraft.  The front end of the
conveyor is raised and lowered by a hydraulic piston located under the conveyor
belt.  The operation of the conveyor belt loader is not prohibited by HO 7.</p><p>b.             
A canister loader truck is a
wheeled vehicle with a lifting device which moves baggage between the terminal
and the aircraft.  Baggage is placed in canisters which hold 50 to 70 bags and
suitcases.  The canisters are then pushed onto the bed of the loader which is
equipped with rollers.  The canisters are rolled onto the loader and are rolled
off onto the plane.  Most of the time this function is automated, however,
sometimes hand loading and/or unloading of the canisters is required.  The load
is raised and lowered by hydraulics to and from the ground level to the cargo
hold of the airplane.  The reverse process takes place during the unloading of
the plane.  Canister loader trucks are high-lift trucks as defined in
29 CFR 570.58(b) and therefore HO 7 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds
from operating, loading and unloading such equipment. </p><p>(3)          
Power winches</p><p>WH
has opined since as early as 1961 that HO 7 prohibits minors under the age of
18 from operating power winches, including those affixed to tow trucks or wrecker
trucks.  Although HO 7 does not specifically state that winches are covered,
the HO does state that the term “hoist” shall mean a power-driven apparatus for
raising or lowering a load by the application of a pulling force that does not
include a car or platform running in guides.  The definition further adds that
the term shall include all types of hoists.</p><p>(4)          
Drilling rig crews  </p><p>Members
of a well drilling crew are considered as assisting in the operation of hoists
and therefore fall under the provisions of HO 7.</p><p>(5)          
Assisting in the operation of
power-driven patient/resident hoists or lifts              </p><p>a.             
WHD issued a Final Rule on May 20,
2010, which removed from HO 7 the exemption that allowed 16- and 17-year-olds
to operate air or electric powered hoists that did not exceed a lift capacity
of one ton (see 75 Fed. Reg. 28404, 28434 (May 20, 2010)). With
the elimination of that exemption, minors under the age of 18 were prohibited
from operating or assisting in operating all power-driven hoists in any workplace,
including power-driven hoists/lifts used to elevate and transport
patients/residents in hospitals, nursing homes, and residences. 
Prohibited equipment includes floor-based vertical powered patient/resident
lift devices; ceiling-mounted vertical powered patient/resident lift devices;
and powered sit-to-stand patient/resident lift devices.</p><p>b.             
On July 13, 2011, WHD issued Field
Assistance Bulletin (FAB) 2011-3 (Assisting in the operation of
power-driven patient/resident hoists/lifts Under the Child Labor Provisions of
the Fair Labor Standards Act) which states that WH will not charge a child
labor violation when properly trained 16- and 17-year-olds, under specific
conditions, assist a trained adult in the operation of power-driven
patient/resident lifts/hoists.  The FAB is available at
http://www.dol.gov/whd/FieldBulletins/index.htm. </p><p>c.             
WH will exercise its enforcement discretion, and not assert
child labor violations involving 16- and 17-year-olds who assist a trained
adult worker in the operation of floor-based vertical powered patient/resident
lift devices, ceiling-mounted vertical powered patient/resident lift devices,
and powered sit-to-stand patient/resident lift devices only when all of the
following conditions are met: </p><p>1.             
The child (16- or 17-year-old) has
successfully completed the 75 clock hours of nurses aide training required by
the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act from the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, as outlined in 42 CFR
§ 483.152, or a higher state standard where applicable, and has
successfully completed the nurses aide competency evaluation detailed in 42
CFR 483.154, or a higher state standard where applicable.  WHD will not
assert a violation of HO 7 when 16- and 17-year-olds engage in the limited
operation of patient lifts as required by this nursing aide training.</p><p>2.             
The child is not operating by
himself or herself floor-based vertical powered patient/resident lift devices,
ceiling-mounted vertical powered patient/resident lift devices, and powered
sit-to-stand patient/resident lift devices and the child is assisting in the
use of lifting devices as a junior member of at least a two-person team that is
headed by an employee who is at least 18 years of age.  All members of the team
must be trained in the safe operation of the lifting devices being used.       </p><p>3.             
As a junior member of the team, the child may set up, move, position,
and secure unoccupied lifting devices.  The child may assist trained adult
employees in attaching slings to and un-attaching slings from lifting devices
prior to and after the lift/transfer of the patient/resident is
completed.  The child may also assist trained adult employees in operating
the controls that activate the power to lift/transfer the patient/resident. 
The child may act as a spotter/observer and may position items such as a chair,
wheelchair, bed, and commode under the patient/resident who is being
lifted/transferred.</p><p>4.             
As a junior member of
the team, the child may not independently engage in “hands on” physical contact
with the patient/resident during the lifting/transferring process (such as
placing or removing the sling, including pushing or pulling the sling
under/around the patient/resident; adjusting the sling under/around the
patient/resident; and manipulating the patient/resident when placing, adjusting
or removing a sling under/around the patient/resident), and may only assist in
these “hands on” activities when assisting a trained adult employee while the
adult employee is simultaneously engaged in such activities.  The child may
similarly assist a trained adult employee who is manipulating, guiding,
rotating, or otherwise maneuvering the patient while the patient is being
lifted/transferred.  In addition, the child may similarly assist a trained
adult employee who is pushing, pulling or rotating lifting devices when the
device is engaged in the process of lifting/transferring a patient/resident.</p><p>5.             
The child is not injured while
operating or assisting in the operation of a lifting device.</p><p>6.             
The employer has provided to each
16- and 17-year-old who will assist in the operation of lifting devices a copy
of the document that was forwarded with this Field Assistance Bulletin as
Attachment A.  Attachment A advised the young worker of what tasks he or she
may and may not perform while assisting in the operation of a power-driven
patient/resident lift/hoist.</p><p>d.             
The above enforcement position
will not apply when WH determines that a 16- or 17-year-old employee has
assisted in the operation of a power-driven patient/resident lifting device and
the requirements discussed in paragraphs 1 through 6 above have not been
met.  In such instances, WH will charge appropriate child labor violations
and the employer will be subject to the assessment of child labor civil money
penalties as permitted by FLSA section 16(e)(1). </p><p>e.             
As noted in paragraph 5 above,
this enforcement policy is also not applicable if a child is injured while
operating or assisting in the operation of power-driven patient hoists/lifts. 
If a child is injured while engaged in such activities, even if the child was
employed in compliance with this nonenforcement policy, WH will generally
charge a violation of HO 7 and assess a civil money penalty.  Notwithstanding
this enforcement policy, WHD will investigate reports of children being injured
while assisting in the operation of power-driven patient hoists/lifts, as well
as complaints that the employer has not complied with the requirements in
paragraphs 1 through 6 above.</p>

              <h3>33h08.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 8—Power-Driven Metal Forming, Punching,
and Shearing Machine Occupations.</h3>
              <p>Name:  Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven metal
forming, punching, and shearing machines.</p><p>Originally Adopted:  October 30, 1950</p><p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 8</b></p><p>(1)  The report establishing HO 8 concluded that
metal-forming, punching and shearing machines are dangerous because they
utilize a heavy crushing or powerful cutting action to perform their work, and
because the operator is required in many cases to place his or her hands close
to the point of operation in feeding them.  Even with guards and better feeding
methods, the report continued, these machines are extremely dangerous.  In
light of the preceding and the fact that state child labor laws varied greatly
and did not reflect “an awareness of the hazards of operating” these machines,
the report recommended the establishment of HO 8. </p><p>(2)  HO 8 is machine specific and it prohibits the
operation, helping to operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or
cleaning power-driven metal forming, punching, and shearing machines.  The
scope of this HO is narrow and does not include a very large group of metal
working machines known as machine tools. </p><p>(3)  Definitions</p><p>a.    
The term operator shall mean a
person who operates a machine covered by this HO by performing such functions
as starting or stopping the machine, placing materials into or removing them
from the machine, or any other functions directly involved in operation of the
machine. </p><p>b.    
The term helper shall mean a
person who assists in the operation of a machine covered by this HO by helping
place materials into or removing them from the machine.</p><p>c.    
The term forming, punching, and
shearing machines shall mean power-driven metal-working machines, other than
machine tools, which change the shape of or cut metal by means of tools, such
as dies, rolls, or knives which are mounted on rams, plungers, or other moving
parts.</p><p>d.    
A rolling machine is a machine
used to change the size or shape of metal by running it between rolls under
pressure.</p><p>e.    
The term pressing or punching
machines shall mean any machine falling within one of the three following types
of machines:</p><p>1.    
A punch press is a machine fitted
with a ram or plunger and a die for the purpose of blanking, trimming, drawing,
punching, or stamping metal.</p><p>2.    
A power press is a large, slow
acting press which performs an operation similar to a punch press, but is intended
to handle very large or very heavy work.</p><p>3.    
A plate punch is a machine for
punching holes (such as for rivets) in heavy metal plate.</p><p>A.   
A bending machine is a machine for
bending metal plate between a stationary bed and a moving ram (metal bending
machines are known as brakes). </p><p>B.   
A hammering machine is a machine
which employs a ram or plunger to pound the material being worked on into the
desired shape.</p><p>C.   
A shearing machine is a machine
for cutting metal by the shearing action of a movable blade or blades.</p><p>D.   
A guillotine shear is a machine
used for cutting heavy metal plates which consists of a movable upper blade and
a stationary lower blade.  The upper blade comes down vertically to meet the
lower stationary blade.</p><p>E.   
An alligator shear is a machine
used for cutting barstock which consists of a movable upper blade and a
stationary lower blade operating like scissors.</p><p>F.    
A circular shear is a machine with
revolving disks which cut the material when it passes through the point where
the revolving disks meet.  It is used for cutting light metal sheets such as
those used in tin cans.  </p><p>G.   
Machine tools are power-driven
complete metal-working machines having one or more tool-or work-holding
devices, and are used for progressively removing metal in the form of chips. 
The following are the five principal types of machine tools classified by their
function:</p><p>i.     
Milling machine tools consist of
machining a piece of metal by bringing it into contact with a rotating cutter
with multiple cutting edges. </p><p>ii.    
Planing machine tools consists of
machining a surface by moving the work back and forth under a stationary
cutting tool. </p><p>iii.  
Turning machine tools consists of
shaping a rotating piece by means of a cutting tool to generate a cylindrical
surface. </p><p>iv.  
Boring machine tools consists of
cutting a round hole by means of a rotating cutting tool. </p><p>v.    
Grinding machine tools consists of
shaping a piece by bringing it into contact with a rotating abrasive wheel.</p><p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>All occupations as an operator of, helper on, or in setting up,
adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning the following power-driven metal
forming, punching, and shearing machines:  </p><p>(1)  All rolling machines such as: beading, straightening,
corrugating, flanging, or bending rolls, and hot or cold rolling mills. </p><p>(2)  All pressing and punching machines (except as an
operator or helper on a punch press with automatic feeding and ejection as
discussed in FOH 33h08(c)(1) below) such as: punch press, blanking press,
forming press, drawing press, stamping press, extrusion press, embossing press,
coining press, assembling press, bending press, power press, riveting press,
eyeletting machine, and plate punch. </p><p>(3)  All bending machines such as:  apron breaks and press
breaks. </p><p>(4)  All hammering machines such as:  drop hammer, helve
hammer, board drop hammer, rope drop hammer, air drop hammer, steam drip
hammer, power hammer, air hammer, and steam hammer. </p><p>(5)  All shearing machines such as:  guillotine shears,
squaring shears, alligator shears, and rotary shears. </p><p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b></p><p>(1)  Occupations as an operator of or as helper on a punch
press equipped with full automatic feed and ejection with a fixed barrier guard
to prevent the hands or fingers of the operator from entering the area between
the dies, power presses, and plate punches. </p><p>(2)  HO 8 does not apply to the operation of machine
tools.  The following is a list of machine tools classified by function:</p><p>a.    
Milling machines:  horizontal
milling machines, vertical milling machines, universal milling machines,
planer-type milling machines, gear cutting machines, profilers, routers, and
circular saws (Circular saws are subject to HO 14). </p><p>b.    
Planing machines:  planers,
shapers, slotters, broaches, keyseaters, hack and band saws (All band saws are
subject to HO 14). </p><p>c.    
Turning machines:  engine lathes,
turret lathes, hollow spindle lathes, automatic lathes, and automatic screw
machines. </p><p>d.    
Boring machines:  vertical boring
mills, horizontal boring mills, jig borers, drilling machines, pedestal drills,
radial drills, gang drills, upright drills, drill presses, multiple spindle
drills, centering machines, reamers, and honers. </p><p>e.    
Grinding machines:  grinders,
abrasive wheels, abrasive belts, abrasive discs, abrasive points, buffing
wheels, polishing wheels, stroppers, and lapping machines (Abrasive cutting
discs are subject to HO 14).</p><p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p><p>There is a provision in HO 8 for apprentices and student-learners. 
There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.</p><p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  The following is a list of power-driven machines that
have been determined to be covered by HO 8:</p><p>a.    
Automatic Bulkan Assembler (the
Bulkan).  This power-driven machine performs a bending or crimping action on
metal and is covered by HO 8.  The machine attaches pre-formed metal edged
paper disks to the top and bottom of cylindrical paper sidewalls.  </p><p>b.    
Hager press.  This hydraulic
press, designed to install a broad range of fasteners in flat or pre-formed
sheet metal assemblies, is covered by HO 8. </p><p>c.    
Metal bottom seamer . This
power-driven machine performs a rolling and bending action on metal and is
covered under HO 8.</p><p>(2)  The following is a list of power-driven machines that
have been determined not to be covered by HO 8:</p><p>a.    
Wheel crusher or rim removing
machine . This machine separates a rim from a tire by using three dies attached
to three rams to bend the tire and the metal rim.  The rim is circular metal
structure specially formed to fit the shape of a wheel, and not a metal plate
or a flat piece of (sheet) metal as required by the HO.  Moreover, the purpose
of the machine is to separate the tire from its rim and not to form the rim
into another shape (which would be the purpose of a bending machine).  In light
of the preceding, a wheel crusher is not a bending machine, or any other kind
of metal forming, punching and shearing machine, and it is not covered by
HO 8. </p><p>b.    
Walco Precision Roller (series 60
and 67).  This machine is used to coat metal and other materials with paint,
various adhesives, and other substances.  The machine does not form, shape, or
reduce the thickness of metal (the function of a rolling machine) and it is not
covered by HO 8. </p><p>c.    
Injection molding press.  When
used to manufacture plastic parts (as opposed to cutting or shaping metal),
this machine is not covered by HO 8. </p><p>d.    
Flox wire cut electrical discharge
machine.  This machine cuts metal using a brass wire as an electrode.  When the
wire is brought near metal, an arc is created eroding the metal.  Since this
technology does not cut or shape metal with tools mounted on rams, plungers, or
other moving parts, it is not a power-driven metal forming, punching or
shearing machine, and is not covered by HO 8.</p><p>(3)  The following is a list of machine tools which are not
covered by HO 8:</p><p>a.     Key Duplicating Machines.
These machines, often located in hardware stores and other retail
establishments, duplicate keys by using a metal cutter.  These machines are
machine tools and therefore outside the scope of HO 8.  An example of a key
duplicating machine that has been determined to be a machine tool is the Axxess
PC key machine (serial #0595187FP).</p><p>b.     Ridgid 535 pipe and bolt
threading machine. This machine is classified as machine tool and not a
shearing machine, even though the cutting knife has a rotary motion.  Since it is
a machine tool, it is not covered by HO 8. </p><p>c.     Landis pipe nipple and
automatic pipe nipple machines. These machines are considered to be machine
tools and not covered under HO 8. </p><p>d.     Brake drum and brake
disc lathes .These lathes (used to repair brakes in automotive and truck repair
shops) are turning machines and are considered machine tools.  They are outside
the scope of HO 8.</p><p>e.     Pipe threading equipment.
Turning machines, such as the Rigid Model 1234 Threading Machine, are machine
tools and not covered under HO 8.</p>

              <h3>33h09.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 9—Occupations in Mining, Other Than
Coal.</h3>
              <p>Name:  Occupations in Connection with Mining, Other than
Coal</p><p>Originally Adopted:  January 6, 1951</p><p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 9</b></p><p>(1)  Prior to the enactment of HO 9, only coal
mining (HO 3) was covered by a hazardous occupations order.  Since the issuance
of HO 9, all mining, with the exception of mining in the petroleum and natural
gas industries, falls within the scope of a hazardous occupations order.  An
investigation of the mining industry concluded, in an April 1950 report, that
all work in this industry involved an “exceptionally high degree of accident
risk” and the employment of young people should be prohibited in the vast
majority of mining occupations.  Moreover, the report cited inadequate state
child labor laws, which in many instances allowed children as young as 14 years
of age to work in underground mines, as an additional reason for establishing
HO 9.</p><p>(2)  HO 9 is industry specific.  It applies to
metal mines, nonmetal mines, ore-dressing plants, quarries, clay pits and clay
mines, and sand and gravel operations.  In terms of product mined, the HO
covers:  iron, copper, lead, zinc, and other metals, barite, gypsum, salt,
sulfur, and other nonmetals, limestone, marble, granite, and other minerals. 
Its scope includes all occupations in connection with mining, other than coal,
with the exception of certain surface occupations not directly concerned with
the extraction or haulage of the mined material.</p><p>(3)  Many occupations prohibited by HO 9 may
also be prohibited by other HOs.  Examples include operating motor-vehicles (HO
2), using a power-driven chain saw to cut timber (HO 5), and operating some
earth moving equipment while working in a tunnel (HO 17).  </p><p>(4)  HO 9 does not cover work in coal mines
which is prohibited by HO 3; in petroleum production; or in the production of
natural-gas.  The HO also does not prohibit work involving most manufacturing
or processing operations applied to the extracted materials.</p><p>(5)  Definitions</p><p>a.    
The term all
occupations in connection with mining, other than coal shall mean:</p><p>1.    
All work performed
underground in mines and quarries; on the surface at underground mines and
underground quarries; in or about open-cut mines, open quarries, clay pits, and
sand and gravel operations; at or about placer mining operations; at or about
dredging operations for clay, sand or gravel; at or about bore-hole mining
operations; in or about all metal mills, washer plants, or grinding mills
reducing the bulk of the extracted minerals and at or about any other crushing,
grinding, screening, sizing, washing or cleaning operations performed upon the
extracted minerals except when those operations are performed as part of a
manufacturing process.</p><p>2.    
The term shall not
include work performed in subsequent manufacturing or processing operations,
such as work performed in:  smelters, electro-metallurgical plants, refineries,
reduction plants, cement mills, plants where quarried stone is cut, sanded and
further processed, or plants manufacturing clay, glass, or ceramic products. </p><p>3.    
Neither shall the term
include work performed in connection with coal mining (see HO 3,
FOH 33h03),
in petroleum production, in natural-gas production, nor in dredging operations
which are not a part of mining operations, such as dredging for construction or
navigation purposes.</p><p>b.    
The term placer mining
shall mean the mining of a placer deposit (a surface deposit of loose particles
of certain heavy minerals—frequently gold) utilizing the following methods:</p><p>1.    
Placer dredging
operations – Operating in a pond, a placer dredge (a kind of floating washer
plant) utilizes a series of buckets connected by a chain to scoop gravel from
the bottom of the pond.  The dredge is also equipped with machinery to recover
the heavy metal from the gravel and dispose of the refuse. </p><p>2.    
Surface placer
operations – This method, often called sluicing, requires a source of water
large enough to make a fast-flowing stream in a sluice box.  At the upper end
of the sluice there is a screen onto which gravel is shoveled or dumped.  Water
runs over the gravel on the screen, washing the fine gravel through it, and the
heavy metal is caught on a bar fastened across bottom of the sluice box.</p><p>3.    
Hydraulic placer
operations – In this method, a powerful stream of water is used to break down
earth and rock and guide the particles through channels into long sluices. 
Diesel power is used extensively for pumps, tractors, or for drag lines, and
some operations use tractors equipped with a blade to push the material to the
sluice box.</p><p>c.    
The term bore-hole
mining shall mean a method of recovering some minerals (most notably sulfur and
salt) by pumping compressed air into the holes bored down to the deposit to
force the mineral to the surface.</p><p>d.    
The term metal mill
operations shall mean a highly automated operation requiring few employees
consisting of three distinct steps:  </p><p>1.    
Preparation (crushing,
grinding, cleaning, and classifying), </p><p>2.    
Separation (jigging,
tabling, heavy-media separation, and froth flotation), and </p><p>3.    
Finishing (including
settling, filtering, drying, and otherwise preparing the concentrates for
shipment).</p><p>e.    
The term washer plant
operations shall mean an operation performed to the ore after it is mined to
remove clay and dirt form the solids.</p><p>f.     
The term grinding mill
operations shall mean the reduction of the concentrate into a powder form at a
grinding mill.  This operation that occurs after the ore is cleansed at a
washer plant.</p><p>(b)  
<b>Occupations
PROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  All occupations involving underground work
in mines or underground quarries.</p><p>(2)  All surface occupations at underground
mines unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(1).</p><p>(3)  All occupations involving work in or about
open cut mines, open quarries (including crushing, screening, and washing),
clay pits (including dredging), and sand and gravel operations (including
dredging, washing, and screening), unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(2).</p><p>(4)  All occupations involving work at or about
placer mining and bore-hole mining operations, unless otherwise permitted by
FOH 33h09(c)(1).</p><p>(5)  All occupations involving work in metal
mills, unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(2).</p><p>(6)  All occupations involving work in washer
plants or grinding mills, unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(1).</p><p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT
SPECIFICALLY BANNED</b></p><p>(1)  The following occupations are permitted
for 16- and 17- year-olds when performed at the surface of underground mines;
in or about open pit mines, open quarries, clay pits and sand and grave
operations; in surface placer mines, including placer dredging operations,
hydraulic placer mining operations and bore-hole mining operations; and in
washer plants or grinding mills:</p><p>a.    
Work in offices, in
the warehouse or supply house, in the change house, in the laboratory, and in
repair or maintenance shops not located underground.  In the case of open
quarries and other types of open-pit operations, this work is permitted in the
pit or quarry proper, but not outside of the building itself.</p><p>b.    
Work in the operation
and maintenance of living quarters (Some of this work may be prohibited by
another HO).</p><p>c.    
Work outside of the
mine in surveying, in the repair and maintenance of roads, and in general
clean-up about the mine property (such as clearing brush and digging drainage
ditches).  This work is not permitted when done underground or in an open
quarry or pit.  For example, maintenance of roads in an open-cut mine would
only be allowed if it was done outside of the open-cut.</p><p>(2)  The following work is permitted in metal mills:  </p><p>a.    
Work involving the operation of
jigs, sludge tables, flotation cells, or drier-filters.</p><p>b.    
Hand-sorting work at picking table
or a picking belt.</p><p>c.    
General clean-up work.</p><p>d.    
Work of track crews in the building
and maintenance of railroad tracks located in an area of an open-cut metal
mine, if haulage and mining activities are not being conducted where the track
crew is working.  This exception applies only to metal mines, since such
operations are vast in scale, much of the track work is physically removed from
the extractive operation, and the track crew can work without undue exposure to
hazard.</p><p>e.    
The only work permitted in
mercury-recovery mills or mills using the cyanide process is the kind of work
stated in FOH 33h09(c)(1) above.</p><p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p><p>There are no provisions in HO 9 for apprentices or
student-learners.  There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.  </p><p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement
positions</b></p><p>(1)  Peat moss</p><p>HO 9 does
not apply to cutting, gathering, piling or any other occupation performed on
peat moss.  Peat moss is defined as partially decomposed sphagnum;
consequently, it is not a mineral within the meaning of this order and any
activities performed on it or to it would not be “occupations in connection with
mining.”</p><p>(2)  Motor-vehicle operator and outside helper</p><p>HO 9
prohibits almost all work in or about a mine, which would include the
occupations of motor-vehicle driver and outside helper.  HO 2 also specifically
prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from performing the occupations of motor-vehicle
driver and outside helper in or about any mine, including an open pit mine or
quarry.  </p><p>(3)  Weighing trucks</p><p>The
weighing of trucks filled with gravel, crushed stone, or other minerals is
prohibited by HO 9.  This work is prohibited even if the minors spend only a
small percentage of their time weighing trucks and the majority of their work
is confined to an office environment.  </p><p>(4)  Processing stockpiled limestone into lime</p><p>HO 9 does
not apply to occupations involved in the processing of stockpiled limestone
into hydrated lime.  This process is deemed to be manufacturing and not mining
(the crushed stockpiled limestone is heated at extreme temperatures to create
quicklime, water is then added to the quicklime to make hydrated lime which is
shipped to the consumer).  The prohibitions of HO 9 would cease to apply when
the extracted, crushed, and screened limestone was stockpiled.</p><p>(5)  Railroad track work</p><p>Track work
performed three miles from the open quarry is not an occupation prohibited by
HO 9 as the work is not in close proximity to the mining haulage or to mining
activities. </p><p>(6)  Processing marble into a finished building
product</p><p>a.    
The prohibitions of HO
9 apply to occupations in the processing of marble into a finished building
material when it involves the following steps:  the marble is quarried, run
through a primary crusher, through a secondary crusher or grinding operation, and
then into elevated storage bins.  The finished product is loaded from these
bins into bulk trucks or it is sacked and stored for later shipment.  </p><p><b>b.     </b>This process is not deemed to be
manufacturing since the marble has not been chemically changed and nothing was
manufactured from the crushed marble (i.e. bricks, blocks, tile, etc.)</p>

              <h3>33h10.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 10—Slaughtering, Meat- and Poultry-Packing,
Processing and Rendering.</h3>
              <p>Occupations in the operation of power-driven meat-processing machines
and occupations involving slaughtering, meat and poultry packing, processing,
or rendering.</p><p>Originally Adopted:  May 8, 1952</p><p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 10</b></p><p>(1)  Meat-packing was one of the most hazardous industries
at the time HO 10 was promulgated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics issued
Bulletin No. 855 (Injuries and Accident Causes in the Slaughtering and
Meat-Packing Industries, 1943), which documented the hazards in this industry. 
Dangers included slips and falls on slippery floors, injuries from live
animals, strains from overlifting, cutting hazards from sharp knives, and
injuries from power-driven equipment.  More recent publications issued by the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) confirm the
continued existence of these hazards and also cite the danger of steam burns,
electric shock, and ergonomic injuries and illnesses.</p><p>(2)  HO 10 originally applied only to occupations in the
slaughtering, rendering, and meat packing industries.  When Congress amended
the FLSA in 1961 to cover certain retail and service enterprises, WH amended HO
10 to cover work in such firms.  Thus, HO 10 applies both on an industry basis
(slaughtering, rendering, and meat-packing) and to the use of certain
power-driven meat-processing machines (including meat slicers) whenever located
in covered establishments and regardless of the material being processed.  In
1981, HO 10 was again amended to clarify that restaurants, fast-food
establishments, and other retail and service establishments are subject to
HO 10 and that 16- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from using power-driven
meat processing equipment in those establishments.</p><p>(3)  HO 10 was amended in 1960 to add the occupations of
setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning certain power-driven
meat-processing machines.  Prior to this, only the occupations of operating or
feeding the various named machines were prohibited by HO 10.  The 2010
revisions to HO 10 clarified that youth under 18 may not clean power-driven
meat processing equipment, including the disassembled parts.  This is true even
if the equipment is disassembled and reassembled by an adult.  Such youth may
operate a commercial dishwasher to run a self-contained rack containing parts
of or attachments to a power-driven meat processing machine through the
dishwasher as long as the youth does not actually handle or touch the machine
parts or attachments (see 75 FR 28435, see also § 570.61(a)(4)).</p><p>(4)  HO 10 was revised in 2010 and its prohibitions were
extended to the slaughtering and processing of poultry.  The term slaughtering
and meat packing establishments was redefined to include places where poultry,
buffalo, or deer, are killed, butchered, or processed.  The term now also
includes establishments which manufacture or process meat or poultry products including
sausage or sausage casings from animals (see 75 FR 28434, see also
§ 570.61(b)).</p><p>(5)  HO 10 does not apply to the killing and processing of
rabbits or small game in areas physically separated from the “killing floor”,
or in separate establishments.  It also does not apply to fish and seafood
processing plants.  These establishments were not included in the original
study of meat-packing plants, were specifically excluded from the Order when it
was issued, and amendments to the HO have not incorporated these
establishments.  </p><p>(6)  Definitions</p><p>a.    
The term retail/wholesale or
service establishments includes establishments where meat or meat products,
including poultry, are processed or handled, such as butcher shops, grocery
stores, restaurants and quick service food establishments, hotels,
delicatessens, and meat-locker (freezer-locker) companies, and establishments
where any food product is prepared or processed for serving to customers using
machines prohibited by this HO.</p><p>b.    
The term slaughtering and
meat-packing establishments means places in or about which such animals as
cattle, calves, hogs, poultry, sheep, lambs, goats, buffalo, deer, or horses
are killed, butchered, or processed.  The term also includes establishments which
manufacture or process meat products or sausage casings from such animals. </p><p>c.    
The term rendering plants means
establishments engaged in the conversion of dead animals, animal offal, animal
fats, scrap meats, blood, and bones into stock feeds, tallow, inedible greases,
fertilizer ingredients, and similar products.</p><p>d.    
The term killing floor includes a
workroom, workplace where such animals as cattle, calves, hogs, poultry, sheep,
lambs, goats, buffalo, deer, or horses are immobilized, shackled, or killed, and
the carcasses are dressed prior to chilling.  The killing floor does not
include coolers.</p><p>e.    
The term curing cellar includes a
workroom or workplace which is primarily devoted to the preservation and
flavoring of meat, including poultry, by curing materials.  It does not include
a workroom or workplace solely where meats are smoked.  The curing cellar may
be located above or below ground.</p><p>f.     
The term hide cellar includes a
workroom or workplace where hides are graded, trimmed, salted, and otherwise
cured.  The hide cellar may be located above or below ground.</p><p>g.    
The term boning occupations means
the removal of bones from meat cuts.  It does not include work that involves
cutting, scraping, or trimming meat from cuts containing bones.</p><p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  HO 10 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from employment
in all occupations involving the operation or feeding of the following
power-driven machines, including setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or

occupations of operating, feeding, setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or
cleaning power-driven bacon-slicing machines and belly-rolling machines.  The
term “bacon-slicing machine” as used in HO 10 refers to those machines which
are designed solely for the purpose of slicing bacon and are equipped with
enclosure or barrier guards that prevent the operator from coming in contact
with the blade or blades, and with devices for automatic feeding, slicing,
shingling, stacking, and conveying the sliced bacon away from the point of
operation.</p><p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p><p>HO 10 does contain an exemption for apprentices and student-learners. 
No other exemptions are applicable to this order.</p><p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  Application of HO 10 to handling of hot
oils</p><p>a.    
The original HO 10
banned, among other things, employment of minors in occupations involved in the
recovery of lard and oils from slaughtered animals, and the rendering of animal
fat.  When Congress amended the FLSA in 1961 to cover certain retail and
service enterprises, the Department of Labor amended HO 10 to extend to retail
establishments, including fast food and full-service restaurants.  Many such
restaurants use commercial deep-fat fryers which have various attachments or
built-in features to facilitate the refining and/or recycling of cooking fats
or oils.</p><p>b.    
The refining, removing
and/or recycling of cooking fats or oils in restaurants is not a process of
“rendering” or “recovery” as described in the original HO 10 (see
29 CFR 570.61(a)(2) and (3)); neither is such refining, removing
and/or recycling of cooking fats or oils covered by any other provision of HO
10.  Furthermore, there was no specific change in the FLSA in 1961 to indicate
any Congressional intent to include within the HO 10 prohibition, the handling
of cooking fats or oils in restaurants.  </p><p>c.    
Consequently, HO 10
does not prohibit minors under age 18 from being employed to clean such
restaurant machines, to remove cooking fats or oils from them, or to clean the
screening or filtering equipment.  </p><p>d.    
However, CL Reg 3 does
prohibit 14- and 15-year-olds from cleaning kitchen equipment (not otherwise
prohibited), removing oil or grease filters, pouring oil or grease through
filters, and moving receptacles containing hot grease or hot oil, when the
equipment, surfaces, containers, and liquids exceed a temperature of 100 °F
(see FOH 33c05(b)(1)a.).</p><p>(2)  Application of HO 10 to power-driven meat processing
machines and bakery machines with attachments</p><p>a.    
A meat slicer with a chute
attachment for processing hard-to-handle foods is covered by HO 10 as long as
the meat-cutting blades are used, even though only non-meat items are being
processed.  Consequently, a 16- or 17-year-old may not operate, dismantle,
reassemble, or clean this machine.  </p><p>b.    
“Food processors” are prohibited
if used to process meat.  Likewise, bakery machines such as vertical dough
mixers that have meat-processing attachments are covered by HO 10 when used to
process meat; and HO 11 when used to process dough. </p><p>(3)  Cleaning of power-driven meat-processing
machines </p><p>a.    
HO 10 prohibits minors under 18
years of age from cleaning power-driven meat processing machines.  This
prohibition includes the cleaning of the individual parts of such machines,
including the blades—even if the machine is dismantled and reassembled by an
adult (see 29 CFR 570.61(a)(4)).  However, such youth may operate a dishwasher
to run a self-contained rack containing such individual parts through the
dishwasher if the youth does not handle or touch the parts (see FOH
33h10(a)(3)).</p><p>b.    
29 CFR 570.33(e) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations which involve operating, tending,
setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing power-driven food slicers
and grinders, food choppers, food processors, food cutters, and food mixers.  </p><p>(4)  Power-driven machines determined to be subject to HO
10:</p><p>a.    
Food processors when used to process
meats.</p><p>b.    
Food grinders, pureeing wands, and
mixers if designed to be used or used on meat.  This same equipment could be
prohibited by HO 11 if used to mix items such as batter.</p><p>c.    
Meat choppers when used to grind
or chop cheese or other products.</p><p>d.    
Liver-skinning machine used to
skin squid or other seafood products.</p><p>e.    
Meat-slicers with tubular feeding
attachments.</p><p>(5)  Power-driven machines determined not to be subject to
HO 10:</p><p>a.    
Meat tenderizers and meat cubers.</p><p>b.    
Food processors with attachments
used only for processing vegetables.</p><p>c.    
Lightweight, small capacity,
portable, countertop mixers discussed in § 570.62(b)(1) and in
FOH 33h11(d) when not used to process meat).   </p><p>d.    
Prawnto Shrimp Machine used to
devein and cut shrimp.</p><p>e.    
Jonsson Shrimp Peeling Machine used
to peel shrimp.</p><p>f.     
Vegetable slicers.</p><p>g.    
Colton Granulator used to force
products through a set of grinder bars and forces the reduced sized products
through a preset mesh screen (i.e. granulator is not a meat grinder).</p>

              <h3>33h11.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 11—Power Driven Bakery Machine Occupations.</h3>
              <p>Name:  Occupations Involved in the Operation of Bakery Machines</p><p>Originally Adopted:  July 21, 1952</p><p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 11 </b></p><p>(1)  Historically, many occupational injuries occurring in
bakeries are caused by a few specific machines.  These injuries are often
serious, producing a disproportionate share of deaths or permanent
disabilities.  HO 11 was issued to prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from operating
certain power-driven bakery machines.  This HO is machine-specific as discussed
in FOH 33h00.  The operation by 16- and 17-year-olds of other bakery machines
not specifically prohibited by the order, while not encouraged, is permitted.</p><p>(2)  This order became effective prior to the 1961 and 1966
FLSA amendments which brought many previously uncovered retail bakeries and
stores under the CL provisions.  Some machines prohibited by HO 11 are found in
retail bakeries, pizzerias, restaurants and other food service establishments –
others are only found in wholesale bakeries.  Violations often occur in small
bakeries where there is little division of labor and most jobs are performed by
all employees.  </p><p>(3)  The scope of this order includes, among other
activities, operating, assisting to operate and cleaning the named machines
wherever found in a covered establishment.  Manually operated (not
power-driven) machines are outside the scope of HO 11.  Assisting to operate
the named machines includes the loading of ingredients into the machines – such
as the placing of flour into a mixer – even when the machines are “turned off”
when the loading is performed.  </p><p>(4)  HO 11 was revised in the 2010 Final Rule to include
two exceptions related to certain lightweight, counter-top food mixers and
certain pizza-dough rollers (see FOH 33h11(d)(2) and (d)(3)).</p><p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>Sixteen- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from operating, assisting to
operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning the following
power-driven bakery machines:</p><p>(1)  Horizontal dough mixer—a horizontal cylinder with a
horizontal shaft with mixing arms; revolves to mix the flour with water, yeast,
salt, etc. to make dough.  This prohibition includes operating a dough
auger/feeder used to process masa for tortillas or tamales.  </p><p>(2)  Vertical dough mixer—a large bowl in which a vertical
spindle with paddles attached mixes flour, water, etc. to make dough (often
used in small bakery and some pizzerias).  </p><p>(3)  Batter mixer—very similar to vertical dough mixer,
except different shaped paddles are used; often used for making cake batter. 
Power-driven “wands” used to mix items such as batters are also prohibited.</p><p>(4)  Bread and/or roll dividing, rounding, or molding
machines—in the past, separate machines performed the operation of dividing,
rounding, and molding of dough for bread and rolls.  More modern machines are
multifunctional and may perform two or all three of these operations.  The
process involves cutting dough into lumps (for one loaf or batch of rolls),
rolling each lump into a ball, and after “proofing”, forming a loaf or a batch
of rolls.  The operation is often continuous, dough being carried from one
machine to another by conveyor.</p><p>(5)  Dough brake—a machine which rolls dough into sheets.</p><p>(6)  Dough sheeter—a machine which rolls dough into very
thin sheets.  This prohibition includes pizza dough rollers and tortilla
roller/molders (also called moulders); but see special exception for operators
of pizza dough rollers discussed in FOH 33h11(d)(3).</p><p>(7)  Combination bread-slicing and wrapping machine—a
machine that slices a loaf of bread and wraps it in a continuous process
(generally only found in large, wholesale type bakeries).</p><p>(8)  Cake cutting band saw—a machine for cutting baked
cakes into squares or rectangles.</p><p>(9)  Cookie and cracker machine—combination machines which
form cookies or crackers from dough.  The operation is continuous, dough
entering at one end and complete cookies or crackers, ready for baking,
emerging at the other end.  Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may serve on a cookie and
cracker machine crew which actually operates the machine while producing
cookies or crackers.  These minors, however, may not set up or adjust these
machines (see FOH 33h11(c)(7)).</p><p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b></p><p>There are a number of occupations involving the operation of
power-driven machines in industrial and retail bakeries that are permitted for
16-and 17-year-old minors, including the following: </p><p>(1)  Ingredient preparation and mixing—flour-sifting
machine operator, flour-blending machine operator and sack-cleaning machine
operator.</p><p>(2)  Product forming and shaping—batter-sealing machine
operator, depositing machine operator, cookie or cracker machine crew member
(but not involving the setting up or adjusting of the machine), wafer machine
operator, pretzel-stick machine operator, pie-dough sealing machine operator,
pie-dough rolling machine operator, pie-crimping machine operator, and wedge
press operator.  </p><p>a.    
A wedge press is a machine that
uses two plates, often one of which is heated, to press balls of dough into the
desired shape.  Such presses are often used to shape tortillas.</p><p>b.    
Because the original study that
led to HO 11 did not address such presses which do not utilize “rollers,” and
subsequent rulemaking did not expand the scope of the HO in this respect, HO 11
does not prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from operating such machines.</p><p>(3)  Finishing and Icing—depositing machine operator,
enrobing machine operator, spray machine operator, icing mixing machine
operator.</p><p>(4)  Slicing and Wrapping –roll slicing and wrapping
machine operator, cake wrapping machine operator, carton packing and sealing
machine operator. </p><p>(5)  Pan washing—spray-type pan washing machine operator,
tumbler-type pan washing machine operator.</p><p>(6)  Donut and pastry filling—donut and pastry filling
machines, including Homogenette and similar machines which automatically inject
fillings into donuts and pastries. </p><p>(7)  Cookie or Cracker Machine Crew Member—Sixteen- and
17-year-olds may work on a crew operating a cookie or cracker machine.  These
machines, found in some wholesale bakeries, usually require crews of two to six
persons.  But minors may not perform work involving the setting up or adjusting
of the cookie or cracker machine.  These tasks, more hazardous than the
operation of the machine during production, are usually performed by the crew
chief (see FOH 33h11(b)(9)).</p><p>(8)  Bread slicing—Sixteen- and 17-year-old bakery or deli
clerks may operate bread slicing and roll slicing machines of the type usually
found in retail bakeries.</p><p>(9)  Cleaning individual parts of power-driven bakery
machines  </p><p>a.    
HO 11 prohibits minors under 18
years of age from cleaning power-driven bakery machines, but this prohibition
does not apply to the cleaning of the individual parts of such machines.  Only
employees over 18 years of age may dismantle or reassemble such machines.  </p><p>b.    
29 CFR  570.33(e) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations which involve operating,
tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing power-driven
food mixers.  Such minors may, however, clean the disassembled parts of such
machines.  </p><p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions </b></p><p>(1)  There are no provisions in HO 11 for apprentices or
student-learners.  There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.  </p><p>(2)  Application of HO 11 to lightweight, small capacity,
counter-top food mixers.</p><p>a.    
Section 570.62(b)(1), effective
July 19, 2010, provides an exception that allows 17- and 18-year-olds to
operate, set up, adjust, repair, oil and clean lightweight, small capacity,
portable counter-top power-driven food mixers that are, or comparable to,
models intended for household use.</p><p>b.    
For purposes of this exemption, a
lightweight, small capacity mixer is one that is not hardwired into the
establishment’s power source, is equipped with a motor that operates at no more
than ½ horsepower, and is equipped with a bowl with a capacity of no more than
five quarts.</p><p>c.    
This exemption shall not apply
when the mixer is used, with or without attachments, to process meat or poultry
products as prohibited by 29 CFR 570.61(a)(4).</p><p>d.    
This exemption does not extend to
the employment of 14- and 15-year-old workers.  Minors under 16 years of age
are prohibited from operating or tending power-driven machinery, including
mixers, by CL Reg 3 (see 29 CFR 570.33(e)).  That regulation
prohibits such minors from operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning,
oiling, or repairing food mixers.</p><p>e.    
WH has determined that the
following mixers are the type that would normally fall within this limited
exemption contained at 29 CFR 570.62(b)(1).</p><p>f.     
The K-Tec Batter Mixer Model LJS
developed for the Long John Silvers quick service restaurant chain.  The Model
LJS weighs about 8 pounds, is 11 inches in height, has a 3-quart capacity, and
operates at 1/16 horsepower. </p><p>g.    
The Kitchen Aide counter top mixer
Model K5SSWH, which is available for home use, weighs 29 pounds, is 16.4 inches
in height, has a 5 quart capacity, and operates at 6/15 horsepower.  </p><p>(3)  Application of HO 11 to certain power-driven
pizza-dough rollers</p><p>a.    
Pizza-dough rollers, a type of
dough sheeter, are normally prohibited under HO 11.  But § 570.62(b)(2)
contains an exception that permits the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to
operate certain pizza-dough rollers that meet the following conditions:</p><p>1.    
They are constructed with
safeguards contained in the basic design so as to prevent fingers, hands, or
clothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers, </p><p>2.    
They have gears that are
completely enclosed, and </p><p>3.    
They have microswitches that
disengage the machinery if the backs or sides of the rollers are removed.  </p><p>b.    
This exception applies only when
all the safeguards in 1. through 3. above are present on the machine, are
operational, and have not been overridden.  </p><p>c.    
The policy described in (a) above
does not extend to minors who set up, adjust, repair, oil or clean the assembled
machine.  </p><p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  Operation and cleaning of power-driven bagel slicers</p><p>a.    
Bagel slicers which operate as
electric knives  </p><p>Sixteen- and 17-year-old employees may operate and clean power-driven
bagel slicers, such as the Edgecraft Chef’s Choice Bagel Pro Bagel Slicer,
which have two blades mounted next to each other running in opposing
directions. </p><p>b.    
Bagel slicers with circular cutting
blades </p><p>1.    
Some power-driven bagel slicers,
like the Oliver Products Bagel and Bun Slicer (Model 702) meet the definition
of a circular saw under HO 14.  These machines saw bagels in half by means of a
thin steel disc, having a continuous series of notches or teeth on the
periphery, mounted on shafting.  Although HO 11 does not address such bagel
slicers, HO 14 would normally prohibit employees under 18 years of age from
operating, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning such machines.</p><p>2.    
At the request of WH, the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has examined the operation
of these machines and has advised WH that employees 16 and 17 years of age who
operate and clean such slicers (with circular blades and enclosed feed chutes)
are exposed to low safety risks.  NIOSH cited the machine’s adjustable guard
and the manufacturer’s warning sign as important contributors to this low
degree of risk.</p><p>3.    
WH will not assert a violation of
HO 14 when 16- and 17-year-old employees operate a power-driven bagel slicer
with a circular blade and enclosed feed chute when the machine is equipped with
an adjustable guard that covers the feed chute and the manufacturer’s warning
sign is affixed to the machine.  WH will not assert a violation of HO 14 when
16- and 17-year-old employees clean such machines.  Such minors, however,
continue to be prohibited from setting up, adjusting, repairing, or oiling such
machines.</p><p>c.    
All power-driven bagel slicers are
“food slicers” under CL Reg 3 and therefore minors under 16 years of age may
not operate, tend, set up, adjust, clean, oil or repair such equipment (see
29 CFR 570.33(e)).</p><p>(2)  Operation of pie-dough rollers by 16- and 17-year old</p><p>a.    
The original investigative report
establishing HO 11 determined that the operation of pie-dough rollers by 16-
and 17-year-olds is safe, however, this determination applies only to those
pie-dough rollers which involve a completely automated process as used in large
wholesale bakeries. </p><p>1.    
This process includes the use of a
pie-dough scaling machine which automatically cuts a predetermined portion of
pie dough and drops it into the “hopper feed” of the pie-dough roller.  The
pie-dough roller then flattens the dough and automatically rotates the dough
through an arc of 90°.  The pie dough is again flattened to form the desired
final shape.  The entire process eliminates any hand contact by the operator
with the rollers during operation.  </p><p>2.    
If a pie-dough roller operates as
described above – in an entirely automatic process with a machine that cuts the
dough into predetermined portions and drops it into a hopper feed or chute
attachment that prevents an operator from making contact with any in-running
points of the rollers – 16- and 17-year olds may operate this equipment.</p><p>3.    
If the pie-dough roller does not
operate as described above, it is prohibited by HO 11.</p><p>b.    
Certain pie-dough rolling machines
are very similar to pizza-dough roller machines in appearance and function (see
FOH 33h11(d)(3) for a discussion about pizza-dough rollers).  HO 11 prohibits
the operation of all pie-dough rollers except those described in (a) above. 
However, WH will not charge a violation of HO 11 regarding the employment of
16- and 17-year-olds who operate pie-dough rollers that are constructed with
safeguards contained in the basic design that prevent fingers, hands, and
clothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers; have gears
that are completely enclosed; and have microswitches that disengage the machinery
if the backs or sides of the rollers are removed.  The policy applies to such
machinery provided that all safeguards are present on the machine, are
operational, and have not been overridden.  This “no violation” policy does not
extend to minors who set up, adjust, repair, oil, or clean this equipment.</p><p>(3)  Application of HO 11 to dough mixers used to mix
ingredients other than dough or batter and to attachments designed for uses
other than dough or batters.</p><p>a.    
Under HO 11 the function of the
agitators determines coverage of the HO.  Therefore, a dough mixer used to mix
vegetables is covered by HO 11 if the same agitators are used as for mixing
dough.  Agitators such as the flat beater, heavy duty wire whip, dough arm, and
sweet dough arm are covered by HO 11 because they are designed for use with
dough and batter.  </p><p>However, if the machine is equipped with separate agitators designed
for use with vegetables or with icing, the functional use of the machine would
be different and it would not be covered.</p><p>b.    
D-Wire Whip—Occasionally,
manufacturers will report that some attachments are designed solely for use on
products lighter than dough or batters such as whipping cream, egg whites,
light icings, and meringues.  This was the case with the D-Wire Whip manufactured
by Hobart.  Field experience has documented that employers are using the
D-Wire-Whip to mix batters and other items like cream cheese despite the
intentions or statements of the manufacturer.  It is a violation of HO 11 for
16- and 17-year-olds to mix batter, cream cheese, or dough using a power-driven
batter mixer or dough mixer, regardless of the design specifications or
intentions of the manufacturer. </p><p>c.    
I-Wire Whip—The I-Wire Whip
attachment, which is used for heavier products such as cake batter and heavy
whipping cream, is also prohibited by HO 11 for use by 16- and 17-year-olds.</p><p>d.    
Cheese Grater or Cheese/Vegetable
Slicer Attachments</p><p>1.    
HO 11 prohibits 16- and
17-year-olds from placing attachments on vertical dough mixers (such as the
cheese grater or vegetable slicer) or removing such attachments, because those
activities constitute the setting up and adjusting of a power-driven bakery
machine.   </p><p>2.    
HO 11 does not, however, prohibit
16- and 17-year-olds from operating attachments to vertical dough mixers that
grate cheese or slice cheese/vegetables as long as someone at least 18 years of
age sets up or adjusts the attachment.  This is because these attachments
negate the operation of the machine as a vertical dough mixer.  The machine
cannot be used as a power-driven bakery machine (a dough mixer) when such
attachments are being used.  However, such minors would be prohibited from
operating any attachment to the mixer that processes meat, such as a meat
chopper or sausage maker, because of HO 10.</p>

              <h3>33h12.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 12—Power-Driven Balers, Compactors,
and Paper Products Machines.</h3>
              <p>Name:  Occupations involved in the operation of balers, compactors, and
paper-products machines </p><p>Originally Adopted:  September 11, 1954</p><p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 12</b></p><p>(1)  HO 12 was issued in response to the finding that the
paper-products industry experienced a somewhat higher general frequency of
injury rate than all manufacturing industries as a whole, and a somewhat higher
frequency of the more serious types of injuries and of deaths.  The
prohibitions regarding scrap paper balers were established to combat the
dangers of being caught in the plungers during the compression process and
suffering strains and other injuries while moving the compressed bales.</p><p>(2)  HO 12 prohibits those under 18 years of age from
operating and assisting to operate certain power-driven machines used in the
manufacture or conversion of paper or pulp into a finished product or in the
preparation of such products for recycling or disposal.  The HO applies
wherever the machines are located when operated by a covered employee.</p><p>(3)  HO 12 was revised effective February 14, 2005 (see
69 FR 75393, December 16, 2004, for more information).  The major revisions
included:</p><p>a.    
Incorporating the provisions of
the Compactors and Balers Safety Standards Modernization Act (August 6, 1996)
which created FLSA § 13(c)(5).  This section, among other things, prohibits
minors under 18 years of age from operating and unloading balers and compactor,
and permits 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not operate or unload, certain
balers and compactors under specific conditions.</p><p>b.    
Expanding the prohibitions of the
HO to include balers and compactors that process other materials in addition to
paper.  Prior to February 14, 2005, only balers and compactors that processed
paper products exclusively fell under the prohibitions of HO 12 (see
FOH 3312(b)(1)a for information regarding the impact of this revision).</p><p>(4)  HO 12 was again revised by a Final Rule, effective
July 19, 2010.  That revision brought all power-driven compactors and balers,
regardless of the materials being processed, under the prohibitions of HO 12. 
The revision also clarified that the limited exemption contained in FLSA §
13(c)(5) that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not operate or unload,
certain equipment applies only to scrap paper balers and paper box compactors. 
</p><p>(5)  Definitions</p><p>a.    
The term operating or assisting to
operate means all work that involves starting or stopping a machine covered by
this section, placing materials into or removing materials from a machine,
including clearing a machine of jammed materials, paper, or cardboard, or any
other work directly involved in operating the machine.  The term does not
include the stacking of materials by an employee in an area nearby or adjacent
to the machine where such employee does not place the materials into the
machine.</p><p>b.    
The term paper products machine
shall mean all power-driven machines used in:</p><p>1.    
the remanufacture or conversion of
paper or pulp into a finished product, including preparation of materials for
recycling, or</p><p>2.    
The preparation of such materials
for disposal—whether the machines are used in establishments that manufacture
converted paper or pulp products or in any other type of establishment.</p><p>c.    
Compactors</p><p>1.    
The term paper box compactor means
a powered machine that remains stationary during operation, used to compact
refuse, including paper boxes, into a detachable or integral container or into
a transfer vehicle.</p><p>2.    
The term compactor that is
designed or used to process materials other than paper means a powered machine
that remains stationary during operation, designed or used to compact refuse
other than paper or cardboard boxes into a detachable or integral container or
into a transfer vehicle.</p><p>d.    
Balers</p><p>1.    
The term scrap paper baler means a
powered machine used to compress paper and possibly other solid waste, with or
without binding, to a density or form that will support handling and
transportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable
container. </p><p>2.    
The term baler that is designed or
used to process materials other than paper means a powered machine designed or
used to compress materials other than paper and cardboard boxes, with or
without binding, to a density or form that will support handling and
transportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable
container.</p><p>e.    
The term Applicable American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard means one of the standards listed
in the chart contained in FOH 33h11(d)(2)a1  The ANSI standard for scrap
paper balers and paper box compactors govern the manufacturing and modification
of the equipment, the operation and maintenance of the equipment, and employee
training.  The Secretary of Labor may add more recent standards to the chart
upon finding that the newer standards are as protective of the safety of minors
as those already on the list.</p><p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  HO 12 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from operating,
assisting to operate, setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning the
following power-driven paper products machines, including those which do not
involve hand feeding, as well as balers and compactors:</p><p>a.    
All balers and compactors,
regardless of the materials being processed.  This prohibition includes equipment
designed to process only paper, equipment designed to process materials other
than paper, and equipment that can process both paper and other materials.</p><p>1.    
HO 12 was revised effective
February 14, 2005, to expand the prohibitions of the HO to include balers and
compactors that process other materials in addition to paper.  Prior to
February 14, 2005, only those balers and compactors that processed paper
products exclusively (no other materials placed in the machine) fell under the
prohibitions of HO 12.</p><p>2.    
HO 12 was again revised, effective
July 19, 2010 to prohibit youth under 18 years of age from operating, assisting
to operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning all
compactors and balers, regardless of the materials being processed.    </p><p>3.    
Other materials which are
processed by scrap paper balers and paper box compactors include, but are not
limited to, plastics, rubber, food waste, foam rubber and aluminum cans.  The
risks which these machines present to minor employees remain the same,
regardless of the materials being processed.  </p><p>b.    
Arm type wire stitcher or
stapler—a power-driven machine, operated by a foot treadle, which stitches
cartons together.  The carton is held by the operator during the operation. 
May be single action or it may operate continuously.</p><p>c.    
Circular or band saw—similar to
and operating the same as wood-working saws, used for sawing fiber or
corrugated paper stock.  It is hand fed.</p><p>d.    
Corner cutter or mitering
machine—a type of punch press used for cutting away corners for set-up box
blanks.  May be horizontal or vertical, cutting one corner (single) or two
corners (double) at a time.  It is hand fed, treadle operated, operating
continuously when pedal is depressed.</p><p>e.    
Corrugating and single- or
double-facing machine—a large machine which combines plain paperboard (liners)
with corrugated paper (filler) to form corrugated paperboard.  Single facing
means a liner on one side; double facing means liners on both sides.  Machine
consists of a series of rolls which corrugates the center and glues the facing
to it.  Operating continuously from rolls of paper stock cutting to size as the
last operation.</p><p>f.     
Envelope die-cutting press—a
machine for cutting envelope blank.  A die is placed by hand on a stack of
paper and a plunger forces the die through the paper.  May be single acting or
continuous in operation.</p><p>g.    
Guillotine paper cutter or shear—a
machine consisting of a heavy knife blade held vertically by the headwork of
the machine used for cutting flat paper stock.  Paper is placed on the bed of
the machine by hand and the machine operated by a foot treadle, hand lever, or
two-handed tripping device.  Machine is single action, making one stroke at a
time.</p><p>h.    
Horizontal bar scorer—a little
used machine for scoring (cutting part-way through) heavy fiber stock.  A die
is supported by a head frame and when operated, descends into the fiber.  The
machine is foot operated and hand fed.</p><p>i.     
Laminating or combining machine—a
machine for gluing together two or more piles of paper to make a fiberboard. 
Operates in same manner as corrugating and single- or double-facing machine.</p><p>j.     
Sheeting machine—a machine for
cutting sheets of paper from a roll of paper.  Knives, mounted on revolving
arms, cut the paper as it goes through the machine.  It operates continuously,
the operator threading the paper through the machine and taking away the cut
sheets. </p><p>k.    
Vertical slotter—a machine for
cutting slots in fiber or box board stock by means of a die which descends when
the machine is operated.  It is hand fed, foot or hand operated.  The eccentric
type employs a toothed die, actuated by a horizontal eccentric-revolving
shaft.  It operates continuously and is hand fed.</p><p>(2)  HO 12 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from operating
platen die-cutting presses, platen printing presses, and punch presses which
involve hand feeding of the machines.  It also prohibits these minors from
setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning these types of machines.</p><p>a.    
platen die-cutting press—a machine
for cutting paper stock by means of a die mounted on the frame of the press
(the chase).  Paper is placed on the platen which swings up against the die. 
It operates continuously.</p><p>b.    
platen printing press—a machine
similar to a platen die-cutting press, except that type for printing is mounted
in the chase, instead of a die.</p><p>c.    
punch press—a machine for cutting
out paper stock by means of a die, mounted on a plunger, which descends when
the press is operated.  May be operated by foot treadle, lever, or two-handed
tripping device.  May be single acting or continuous.</p><p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b></p><p>(1)  There are many machines used in the paper-products
industries which are not covered by this HO.  The most important of these
machines are the following:</p><div>

</div><p>(2)  HO 12 does not apply to machines which exclusively
process leather or any substances other than paper or paper products (other
than balers and compactors discussed below).</p><p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p><p>(1)  HO 12 contains an exemption for student-learners and
apprentices.</p><p>(2)  Loading of certain scrap paper balers and paper box
compactors.</p><p>a.    
Public Law 104-174, signed August
6, 1996, amends § 13(c) of the FLSA to permit minors 16 and 17 years of age to
load (but not operate or unload) certain scrap paper balers and paper box
compactors if all of the requirements listed below are met.  This exemption
covers only the loading of such equipment, and only scrap paper balers and
paper box compactors.  No youth under 18 years of age may load any other type
of compactor or baler.  HO 12 (§ 570.63) reflects this statutory language.</p><p>1.    
The employer must ensure that the
equipment meets, and continues to meet, one of the American National Standards
Institute’s (ANSI) Standards listed in the chart below.  One column of
standards is specific to scrap paper balers and the other is specific to for
paper box compactors.</p><div>

</div><p>2.    
The ANSI standards are industry
standards which govern the design, manufacture, operation and maintenance of
the equipment.</p><p>3.    
The FLSA does permit the Secretary
to adopt any newer ANSI standards under HO 12 once it is determined that they
are at least as protective of the safety of minors as the standards listed
above.  </p><p>4.    
The employer must provide notice
and post a notice on each piece of equipment stating that the equipment meets
the appropriate ANSI standard named above; that 16- and 17-year-olds may only
load the equipment; and that any employee under 18 may not operate or unload
such equipment.</p><p>A.   
WH has determined that “posting” a
prominent and easily visible notice will also satisfy the requirement that
notice be “provided” (see 29 CFR 570.63(c)(1)(iv)).</p><p>B.   
There is no one format that the
notice must follow to satisfy the posting requirement, but WH believes that the
intent of FLSA § 13(c)(5) will be satisfied if each notice: </p><p>i.     
Contains an accurate statement
that the baler or compactor to be loaded by the minor meets the applicable ANSI
standard named in § 13(c)(5)(B)(i)(I) of the FLSA or meets a more recent ANSI
standard which the Secretary has certified to be at least as protective of the
safety of minors as the standard described in FLSA § 13(c)(5)(B)(i)(I);
and</p><p>ii.    
Cites the specific ANSI standard,
including the year of issuance, that the employer is providing notice that the
equipment meets; and</p><p>iii.  
Includes a clear statement that 16-
and 17-year-olds may only load the scrap paper balers and paper box compactors;
and, </p><p>iv.  
Includes a clear statement that no
employee under the age of 18 may operate or unload the scrap paper balers and
paper box compactors.  </p><p>C.   
WH has been advised that industry
associations such as the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) and the National
Grocers Association (NGA) have developed and marketed to their members
“notices” or “stickers” believing that such notices or stickers comport with
the requirements of FLSA § 13(c)(5).</p><p>i.     
WH has examined the sample notices
or stickers created by both the NGA and the FMI and, as discussed in the
preamble to the final rule that became effective on February 14, 2005, noted
that these stickers do not satisfy the posting requirements of FLSA § 13(c)(5)
(see 69 FR 75394, December 16, 2004).  The stickers do not clearly
identify the applicable ANSI standard as required.  ANSI includes, in the
caption or title of each of its standards, both a “series identifier” and a
year of issuance, so as to eliminate confusion between different editions of
standards that apply to the same type of machinery.  </p><p>ii.    
WH will consider the NGA and FMI
stickers to constitute acceptable notices if they are modified to state
explicitly the full caption of the ANSI standard (both the series identifier
and the year of issuance).  This modification may, of course, be made by
printing all future stickers with the full, accurate information as to the
specific applicable standard.  But existing stickers may also be modified by
making hand-written insertions of the additional information that is necessary
to identify the specific standard.  Such insertions must be written legibly, in
indelible ink, and in the same size of lettering as the ANSI standard
identifiers already printed on the sticker.</p><p>iii.  
The NGA and the FMI have also
developed stickers to be placed on equipment that does not meet the
requirements of the limited exemption contained in FLSA § 13(c)(5) and,
therefore, cannot be loaded, operated or unloaded by any employee who is less
than 18 years of age.  These stickers, which are not required by the Act and
the use of which is completely voluntary, alert employees that they may not
load, operate or unload the equipment unless they are 18 years of age or
older.  </p><p>D.   
Community-owned or -operated
balers and compactors  In certain situations, such as at a shopping mall,
industrial park, office building, or military base, multiple employers may have
access to and use community balers and compactors that the facilities manager
or owner has made available to the tenants or contractors.</p><p>i.     
In these situations, it is not
necessary for every employer (tenant) to post a notice as required by FLSA §
13(c)(5).  The facilities manager or owner, or the owner of the equipment, may
make the necessary postings and satisfy each employer's (tenant's) posting
obligations under the exception.</p><p>ii.    
But, should the notice not be
accurate or complete—i.e., the baler or compactor fails to meet the appropriate
ANSI standard, or the notice fails to fully identify the appropriate ANSI
standard—the burden of compliance remains with the employer (tenant) of any
youth who loaded the equipment.  An incomplete or inaccurate posting by the
facilities manager or owner will not relieve a tenant from being charged with a
violation of HO 12.   </p><p>75 FR 28440-41 (May 20, 2010)</p><p>iii.  
Employers cannot delegate their
responsibilities for compliance by relying on the accuracy of notices posted by
others.</p><p>5.    
The equipment must include an
on-off switch incorporating a key-lock or other system, and the control of the
system is maintained in the custody of employees who are at least 18 years of
age.  The “other system” may be a numerical touch pad but the passcode may not
be shared with employees under the age of 18 years.</p><p>6.    
The on-off switch of the equipment
must be maintained in an off position when the equipment is not in operation.</p><p>7.    
The equipment cannot be operated
while it is being loaded.</p><p>b.    
The language and legislative
history of the amendment make it clear that it is the responsibility of the
employer to make the initial determination that the equipment to be loaded by
16- and 17-year-olds meets the appropriate ANSI standards.  It is also the
employer’s responsibility to provide the notice and post it on each piece of
equipment which is loaded by 16- and 17-year-olds.  For enforcement purposes,
the posting of the notice will also satisfy the requirement that notice be
provided.</p><p>c.    
Loading of scrap paper balers and
paper box compactors not only encompasses the placing of materials into the
machines, but also includes placing materials into chutes that, by gravity,
feed the materials to the machines.  Loading also includes placing materials
onto conveyors that, by power or gravity, then feed the materials into the
balers or compactors.</p><p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  Laminators and packaging machines</p><p>a.    
The type of laminators prohibited
by HO 12 are those used to laminate or combine two or more sheets of paper or
cardboard to form a multiple-ply product by applying an adhesive and running
the paper through various pressure rolls.  </p><p>b.    
Laminators, such as the GBC Pouch
Laminator, which are designed to encase a document such as an identification
card between two pieces of plastic by using heat in a simple process, are not
subject to HO 12. </p><p>c.    
Machines designed to enclose and
seal products (i.e., pills and capsules) in packaging consisting primarily of
plastic or foil and some cardboard or paperboard, are not within the scope of
HO 12.  Names for this type of machine include dry mounting/laminating press;
jumbo sealer; and the euclid cadet or cadet twin unit dose strip packaging
machine.</p><p>(2)  Silk Screen printing press</p><p>This equipment, when
designed to function in the same manner as the platen printing press, is
prohibited for use by persons under the age of 18.</p><p>(3)  Three spindle paper drill (Challenge Model EH-3A for
example)</p><p>This equipment, used
for die-cutting or embossing operations, operates in the same manner as a hand
fed punch press.  Minors under 18 years of age are prohibited from operating
this equipment. </p><p>(4)  Kansmacker</p><p>The kansmacker is a
power-driven machine that sorts, counts and flattens beverage cans.  It is not
covered by HO 12.</p><p>(5)  Decollators and bursters</p><p>A decollator is a
machine which separates stacks of multi-part paper into individual stacks (for
each copy) while removing the carbon paper.  It is often capable of trimming
the pin-feed holes from one or both sides.  A burster is a machine that takes
continuous single copy and bursts it into individual sheets or pages.  These
machines do not come within the definition of paper products machines and are
not covered under HO 12.</p><p>(6)  Cylinder press</p><p>HO 12 does not
prohibit the operation of a cylinder press.  Such machines are considered much
less hazardous than platen presses, where feeding takes place at the point of
operation. </p><p>(7)  Paper shredders </p><p>The operation of paper
shredders is not prohibited by HO 12.  In addition, paper shredders of the type
normally used in offices may be operated by minors 14 and 15 years of age.</p><p>(8)  Stitcher-trimmer machine</p><p>a.    
A stitcher-trimmer machine
automatically collates, stitches (inserts wire staples), and trims such things
as pamphlets, periodicals, and other paper products.  WHD has examined
stitcher-trimmer machines and has determined that HO 12 does not prohibit minors
from operating those stitcher-trimmer machines that do not use a guillotine
paper cutter or shear to trim the product.  This machine is not to be confused
with an arm-type wire stitcher or stapler – a power-driven machine
prohibited by HO 12, operated by a foot treadle, and used to stitch or staple
cartons together (see FOH 33h12(b)(1)b).    </p><p>b.    
HO 12 does prohibit youth under 18
years of age from operating those stitcher-trimmers that use a guillotine paper
cutter or shear to trim the product.  Such prohibited equipment includes the STAHL
ST-90 and the Stitchmaster ST-100, both manufactured by
Heidelberg.  </p><p>(9)  LiftPak compactor</p><p>a.    
The LiftPak Compactor Model 1000,
manufactured by LiftPak, L.C., is an indoor compactor that processes material,
including paper products, by use of a ram.  This equipment is often used by
quick service restaurants.  When it is time to unload the machine, a built-in
cart containing the compacted waste is detached from the machine and manually
wheeled to the dumpster.  The operator then pushes a button on the cart and an
electric lift raises the compacted refuse to the height of the dumpster.  After
the lift tray is released, the refuse is allowed to fall into the dumpster by
gravity.  The operator then lowers the lift and wheels the cart back to the
main machine for reattaching. </p><p>b.    
Because the LiftPak Compactor
Model 1000 is a compactor that processes materials such as food waste and
plastic in addition to paper products, youth under 18 years of age are
prohibited from operating and unloading such equipment (as of February 14,
2005)—and may only load such equipment if they meet the requirements of the
exemption contained in HO 12 (see 29 CFR 570.63(c) and
FOH 33h12(d)(2)).  The prohibition on unloading includes all the
activities associated with depositing the compacted refuse into the dumpster,
including returning and reattaching the built-in cart to the equipment.</p><p>c.    
WH learned that LiftPak, L.C. has
marketed the Model 1000 as a compactor that “employees don’t have to be 18 to
operate…” and has stated on its Webpage that the Department of Labor has
approved the equipment for use by employees 16 and older.  Although such
advertisements may have been proper prior to the publication of the Final Rule
that modified HO 12 effective February 14, 2005, this information is no longer
correct.  </p><p>d.    
The electric lift that raises the
detached compaction compartment to the height of the dumpster during the
unloading process cannot be considered a hoisting apparatus prohibited under HO
7.  But as mentioned in (b) above, the detaching, emptying, and reattaching of
the container containing the waste is prohibited as “unloading” under HO 12.</p>

              <h3>33h13.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 13—Brick Tile and Kindred Products.</h3>
              <p>Name:  Occupations Involved in the Manufacture of Brick, Tile, and
Kindred Products</p><p>Originally Adopted:  September 1, 1956</p><p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 13</b></p><p>(1)  The rate of injuries in the clay/silica construction
products industry (as determined by the report establishing HO 13) exceeded the
injury rate (including serious injuries) found in the majority of manufacturing
establishments.  The report attributed the higher frequency of worker injuries
in this industry to:  lifting, carrying, and pushing heavy objects; bricks
falling on workers from stacks or out of the workers’ hands onto themselves,
vehicle—pedestrian accidents, machine injuries, and falls caused by slippery
floors.  The report recommended that a Hazardous Occupations Order be created
to ban the employment of minors in most occupations in the clay/silica
construction products industry.</p><p>(2)  HO 13 is industry specific.  It applies to all work in
or about plants manufacturing clay construction products – except work in the
drying departments of plants manufacturing sewer pipe, in storage and shipping,
in offices, in laboratories, and in storerooms.  It also applies to work in or
about plants manufacturing silica brick, or other silica refractories, except
work in offices.</p><p>(3)  Definitions</p><p>a.    
The term clay construction
products includes the following:  brick, hollow structural tile, sewer pipe and
kindred products, refractories, and other clay products, such as: 
architectural terra cotta, glazed structural tile, roofing tile, stove lining,
chimney pipes and tops, wall coping, and drain tile.  The term does not include
non-structural clay products, such as ceramic floor and wall tile, mosaic tile,
glazed and enameled tile, faience and similar tile.  Nor does the term include
non-clay construction products such as sand-lime brick, glass brick, or
non-clay refractories.</p><p>b.    
The term silica brick or other
silica refractories means refractory products produced from raw materials
containing free silica as their main constituent.</p><p>c.    
The terms drawing and wheeling
shall mean the process of removing brick, after it has cooled, from the kiln to
storage.</p><p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  All occupations (except those permitted in
FOH 33h13(c)(1)) in or about establishments engaged in manufacturing clay
construction products.  Examples of prohibited occupations/machines include: 
crushers, granulators, dry pans, and screens; storage bin work; operators of
pug mills, auger or extrusion machines; cutting machines; hackers; car pushers;
sewer pipe press crew; brick forming machine crew; glaziers; setters, tossers;
burners; and drawers.  </p><p>(2)  All work/occupations (except in offices) in
establishments engaged in manufacturing silica brick or other silica
refractories.</p><p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b></p><p>(1)  The following are permissible occupations for
establishments in the clay construction products industry:</p><p>a.    
Work in storage and shipping.</p><p>b.    
Work in offices.</p><p>c.    
Work in the drying departments of
plants manufacturing sewer pipe.</p><p>(2)  Work in offices in establishments manufacturing silica
brick or other silica refractories.</p><p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p><p>There are no provisions in HO 13 for apprentices or student-learners. 
There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.  </p><p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  Glazing of cylinders</p><p>Work in and about a
plant where silica, lime, and asbestos are mixed together to form a glaze
(subsequently used to coat the inside of cylinders) is work prohibited by HO
13.  The glaze contains free silica as a main constituent; consequently, the
area where it is produced meets the definition of an establishment where silica
refractories are manufactured (see 29 CFR 570.64(a)(2) and
570.64(b)(2)).  In light of the preceding, work in or about such an
establishment is prohibited.</p><p>(2)  Asbestos</p><p>Asbestos is a form of
magnesium silicate; however, it does not contain any free silica.  Since it does
not contain free silica, establishments manufacturing asbestos are not making a
silica refractory and are not covered by HO 13.</p><p>(3)  Shipping and storage of brick</p><p>a.    
Preparing bricks for storage,
inside the manufacturing building and adjacent to the kilns (even after the
bricks have been removed from the kiln and placed on flat cars), is work
covered by HO 13.  For example: stacking the bricks on skids, and strapping
them down in order to move them to a storage area outside the building, is work
considered to be within the drawing and wheeling department and not within the
purview of storage and shipping.</p><p>b.    
Removing bricks from inside the
kiln in the process of loading them or moving them to storage, is not work in
storage and shipping, and therefore is covered by HO 13.</p><p>(4)  Clay drain tile</p><p>The setting and
drawing of tile in clay drain tile plant is prohibited by HO 13.</p>

              <h3>33h14.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 14—Power Driven Circular Saws, Band
Saws, Guillotine Shears, Chain Saws, Reciprocating Saws, Wood Chippers, and
Abrasive Cutting Discs.</h3>
              <p>Name:  Occupations involved in the operation of circular saws, band
saws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, and
abrasive cutting discs.</p><p>Originally Adopted:  November 15, 1960</p><p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 14</b></p><p>(1)  HO 14 is broad and embraces the use of circular saws,
band saws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers,
and abrasive cutting discs wherever they are used—other than in the industries
where they are already prohibited by earlier HOs.  This HO differs from most
other HOs in that it recognizes that the above named machines are banned
irrespective of the specific industry in which they are used or the specific
materials (paper, meat, metal, etc.) upon which they are being used.  The use
of most saws and shears is prohibited by HOs 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, and 12.  HO 14
was issued to “close the gap” and protect youths working in other industries
where such machines are used.</p><p>a.    
Examples include:</p><p>1.    
HO 4 prohibits the use of chain
saws by minors in logging operations.</p><p>2.    
HO 5 prohibits the use of saws in
woodworking operations such as furniture factories and construction sites.</p><p>3.    
HO 8 prohibits the use of
guillotine shears on metal.</p><p>4.    
HO 10 prohibits the use of saws to
cut meat and bones.</p><p>5.    
HO 11 prohibits the use of saws to
cut bakery products.</p><p>6.    
HO 12 prohibits the use of saws
and shears to cut paper products.</p><p>(2)  HO 14 became effective before the 1961 and 1966
amendments to the FLSA that made previously noncovered retail stores subject to
the child labor provisions.  It was revised by the 2010 Final Rule (see 75 FR
28404), which added more types of prohibited machines.  Since the scope of HO
14 is broad, it can be applied to circular saws, band saws, guillotine shears,
chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, and abrasive cutting discs found
in all establishments covered by the FLSA.</p><p>(3)  Generally, WH will only charge a single violation when
the same piece of equipment is prohibited by HO 14 and another HO (such as HO
5, HO 11, HO 12, etc.) WH normally will apply the provisions of HO 14 whenever
a piece of equipment named in HO 14 is the subject of the violation. For
example, wood chippers meet the definition of power-driven woodworking machines
contained in § 570.55(b) and therefore are prohibited by HO 5.  But because
such equipment is specifically named in HO 14, and is used in a variety of
establishments (saw milling, pallet shops, mulch manufacturing, landscape
services, waste disposal and recycling, etc.), WH will generally charge
violations regarding the operating and assisting in the operation of wood
chippers under HO 14.</p><p>(4)  The scope of this order includes operating, assisting
to operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or and cleaning the named
equipment wherever found in a covered establishment.</p><p>(5)  HO 14 covers only power-driven equipment; any
occupation that involves only manually operated saws, cutting discs, or shears
(not power-driven) is outside the scope of the HO.</p><p>(6)  Definitions</p><p>a. The term abrasive cutting disc shall mean a machine
equipped with a disc embedded with abrasive materials used for cutting
materials.</p><p>b.    
The term band saw shall mean a
machine equipped with an endless steel band having a continuous series of
notches or teeth, running over wheels or pulleys, and used for sawing materials.</p><p>c.    
The term chain saw shall mean a
machine that has teeth linked together to form an endless chain used for
cutting materials</p><p>d.    
The term circular saw shall mean a
machine equipped with a thin steel disc having a continuous series of notches
or teeth on the periphery, mounted on shafting, and used for sawing materials.</p><p>e.    
The term guillotine shear shall
mean a machine equipped with a movable blade operated vertically and used to
shear materials.  The term shall not include other types of shearing machines,
using a different form of shearing action, such as alligator shears or circular
shears.</p><p>f.     
The term reciprocating saw shall
mean a machine equipped with a moving blade that alternately changes direction
on a linear cutting axis used for sawing materials.  Jig saws are reciprocating
saws.</p><p>g.    
The term wood chipper shall mean a
machine equipped with a feed mechanism, knives mounted on a rotating chipper
disc or drum, and a power plant used to reduce to chips or shred such materials
as tree branches, trunk segments, landscape waste, and other materials.</p><p>h.    
The term operator shall mean a
person who operates a machine covered by this section by performing such
functions as starting or stopping the machine, placing materials into or
removing them from the machine, or any other functions directly involved in
operation of the machine.</p><p>i.     
The term helper shall mean a
person who assists in the operation of a machine covered by this section by
helping place materials into or remove them from the machine.</p><p>j.     
The term machine equipped with
full automatic feed and ejection shall mean machines covered by this HO which
are equipped with devices for full automatic feeding and ejection and with a
fixed barrier guard to prevent completely the operator or helper from placing
any part of his or her body in the point-of-operation area.</p><p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  HO 14 prohibits minors from performing the occupations
of operator of, or helper on, power-driven circular saws, band saws and
guillotine shears which are not equipped with full automatic feed and ejection.</p><p>(2)  HO 14 prohibits minors from performing the occupations
of operator or helper on power-driven chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood
chippers, and abrasive cutting discs; it does not matter if the machines are
fixed or portable.</p><p>(3)  HO 14 prohibits minors from performing the occupations
of setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning power-driven circular
saws, band saws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood
chippers, or abrasive cutting discs regardless of the manner items are fed into
or ejected from the machines.</p><p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b></p><p>Minors may operate or help in the operation of circular saws, band saws
and guillotine shears when the equipment is fitted with devices for full
automatic feeding and ejection and with a fixed guard which prevents operators
or helpers from placing any part of their bodies in the point-of-operation
area.  There is no such provision for operating or assisting in the operation
of chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, or abrasive cutting discs.</p><p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p><p>HO 14 does provide an exemption for student-learners and apprentices. 
No other exemptions apply.</p><p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  HO 14 does not apply to the following machines as they
fail to meet the specific definitions of circular saws, band saws or guillotine
shears:</p><div>

Operations.</h3>
              <p>Name:  Occupations involved in wrecking, demolition, and shipbreaking
operations.</p><p>Originally Adopted:  November 15, 1960</p><p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 15</b></p><p>(1)  The study promulgating HO 15 noted that wrecking and
demolition work is fraught with many hazards including those involved with
maintaining and operating power equipment; falls from many levels while working
on scaffolds, on insecure walls and around unguarded material chutes; being
struck by falling objects or swinging loads; collapse of walls; and other
hazards such as the dangers of high voltage, fire, explosions, and muscle
strains from handling heavy materials.</p><p>(2)  HO 15 is industry-wide and deals with occupations
performed on site of total or partial razing, demolishing, or dismantling of
buildings, bridges, steeples, towers, chimneys, other structures, ships or
other vessels, including clean-up and salvage work.</p><p>(3)  Definitions</p><p>The term wrecking,
demolition, and shipbreaking operations shall mean all work, including clean-up

asbestos or other hazardous materials from a building or other structure prior
to demolition is not uncommon – it makes the work safer.  Such work is subject
to HO 15.  But if the hazardous materials are being removed from the building

              <h3>33h16.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 16—Roofing Operations and   Work On
or About a Roof.</h3>
              <p>Name:  Occupations in Roofing Operations and On or About a Roof</p><p>Originally Adopted:  December 27, 1961</p><p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 16</b></p><p>(1)  At the time HO 16 was written, roofing had long been
recognized as one of the most hazardous occupations in the building
construction industry.  The report establishing HO 16 determined the hazards
associated with roofing – such as falling from roofs and leaning out over the
edge of a roof to receive hoisted materials – were difficult to control and the
resulting injuries were frequently very serious.  In light of this, the report
concluded that “all work performed in connection with the application of
weather-proofing materials and substances to the roofs of buildings and
structures is too hazardous for the employment of 16 and 17 year old persons.”</p><p>(2)  HO 16 was originally specific to the roofing industry,
prohibiting all roofing industry operations, including those operations not
performed on a roof.  HO 16 was revised, effective February 14, 2005, to also
prohibit all work on or about a roof (see 69 FR 75397-98).  </p><p>(3)  Definitions (see 29 CFR 570.67(b))</p><p>a.    
The term roofing operations means
all work performed in connection with the installation of roofs, including
related metal work such as flashing, and applying weatherproofing materials and
substances (such as waterproof membranes, tar, slag or pitch, asphalt prepared paper,
tile, composite roofing materials, slate, metal, translucent materials, and
shingles of asbestos, asphalt, wood or other materials) to roofs of buildings
or other structures.  The term also includes all jobs on the ground related to
roofing operations such as roofing laborer, roofing helper, materials handler
and tending a tar heater. </p><p>b.    
The term on or about a roof
includes all work performed upon or in close proximity to a roof, including
carpentry and metal work, alterations, additions, maintenance and repair,
including painting and coating of existing roofs; the construction of the
sheathing or base of roofs (wood or metal), including roof trusses or joists;
gutter and downspout work; the installation and servicing of television and
communication equipment such as cable and satellite dishes; the installation
and servicing of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment or similar
appliances attached to roofs; and any similar work that is required to be
performed on or about roofs.</p><p>1.    
The regulatory phrase on or about
a roof is not limited to circumstances where the minor employee is standing or
working on the roof itself.  The prohibition extends to standing or working on
a ladder or scaffold at or near the roof, working on the installation of roof
trusses or joists which will support the roof, as well as working from or being
transported to or from the roof in mechanical devices such as hoists.  </p><p>2.    
Generally, 16- and 17-year-olds
may legally perform certain occupations that require them to work at heights,
such as painting, window washing, installing siding, and the power-washing of
walls.  But such occupations would be prohibited when the minor is required to
work in close proximity to a roof.  WH has adopted two enforcement positions
that provide guidance as to when the employment of a youth performing such
occupations violates HO 16 because he or she is working in close proximity
to a roof (See FOH 33h16(d)(1)).</p><p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  HO 16 prohibits all occupations in roofing
operations.  This includes work done on the ground such as material handling,
tending tar kettles, and clean-up work.</p><p>(2)  As of February 14, 2005, HO 16 also prohibits the
performance of any work on or about a roof.</p><p>(3)  Minors under 18 years of age are also prohibited from
using a roof as a point of access, egress, or a platform from which to access
or perform other work such as window washing or the rigging of window washing
equipment.</p><p>(c)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p><p>HO 16 does contain an exemption for student-learners and apprentices. 
There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.</p><p>(d)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  Working in close proximity to a roof</p><p>a.    
Single-story building </p><p>1.    
WH will not charge a violation of
HO 16 when a minor is working in proximity to a roof of a one-story building as
long as the minor’s feet are never more than three feet off the ground level. 
The three-foot tolerance is measured from the ground or pavement at the base of
the building to the bottom of the minor’s feet.  </p><p>2.    
The minor is still prohibited from
performing any work described in FOH 33h16(a)(3) above.</p><p>b.    
Multiple-story building</p><p>1.    
WH will not charge a violation of
HO 16 when a minor is working in proximity to a roof of a multi-story building
(a building of more than one story) if the minor always maintains a distance of
at least three feet (36 inches) from the roof edge.  The 36 inches is measured
from the top of the youth’s head to bottom edge of the roof that is directly
over (perpendicular to) the youth’s head.     </p><p>2.    
A distance of 3 feet ensures that
the working minor, no matter how long his or her reach, will not come into
contact with the bottom edge of the roof of a multi-story building.</p><p>3.    
Using a straight, vertical line
from the top of the minor’s head to the bottom of the roof’s edge to measure
the 36 inch allowance permits minors to work at various heights on buildings
that do not have horizontal or single-level roof lines, such as split level
buildings, gabled buildings and sheds.</p><p>c.    
The enforcement positions
discussed in a. and b. above apply only as long as the minor does not use the
roof to egress the work area and is not performing work that is prohibited by
HO 16 or any other HO.</p><p>(2)  Removal of an old roof</p><p>The tearing off of the
old roof in conjunction with the installation of a new roof is considered a
“roofing operation” and is covered under HO 16, notwithstanding that different
mechanics may perform this work in various geographic areas.</p><p>(3)  Metal buildings  </p><p>a.    
Prior to February 14, 2005, the
installation of metal roofs generally did not fall within the prohibitions of
HO 16 because such work was normally performed entirely by ironworkers,
steelworkers, or sheet metal mechanics – not by roofers.  Consequently, in most
instances, this work was not considered a “roofing operation” prohibited by HO
16.  On February 14, 2005, HO 16 was revised to prohibit youth under 18 years of
age from installing metal roofs, including those on metal buildings (see
29 CFR 570.67(b)).</p><p>b.    
Roofing companies do occasionally
remove existing all-metal roofs and replace them, and the purlins, with a new
roof.  The work continues to be considered a “roofing operation” covered by HO
16.</p><p>(4)  Weatherproofing the top of television transmitting

              <h3>33h17 . HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 17—Excavation Operations.</h3>
              <p>Name:  Occupations in Excavation Operations</p><p>Originally Adopted:  May 9, 1963</p><p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 17</b></p><p>(1)  Individuals employed in excavation operations (which
includes trenching, building excavation, tunneling, and shaft sinking) are
exposed to injury producing hazards such as cave-ins, falls climbing in and out
of the excavated site, working in close proximity with heavy earth moving
machines, and the fall of rock from the sides and roof of the site.  Excavation
operations were selected for study, according to the report establishing HO 17,
because several states had requested an investigation by the Department and
because the Department had received many reports concerning minors being injured
while employed in excavation operations.  Fatalities and injuries resulting
from cave-ins are still a problem in the construction industry.  On April 17,
1998, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) issued a
“warning” concerning the danger of cave-ins.  This report stated that six
workers were killed by cave-ins in the first four months of 1998, and that, on
average, 60 people die each year in accidents caused by cave-ins. </p><p>(2)  HO 17 is process specific.  The scope of HO 17
includes all work excavating, working in, and backfilling trenches; excavating
for buildings or other structures and working in such excavations; driving
tunnels; and sinking shafts, except in certain specified situations (see FOH
33h17(c)).  It does not include site clearing or surface grading operations,
dredging and bore-hole drilling operations, and mining and quarrying operations
covered by HO 3 and HO 9. </p><p>(3)  Definitions </p><p>a.    
The term excavation operation
means the removal of earth, rock, or other material to form a cavity below the
surface of the ground.  </p><p>b.    
The term trenches includes ditches
(see Acting Administrator Flynn's letter of January 24, 1990).</p><p>c.    
The term angle of repose is that
angle where the soil comprising the cut side walls no longer moves or it is at
rest.</p><p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  HO 17 prohibits minors from working in occupations in
excavating, working in, or backfilling (refilling) trenches [except they may
manually excavate/backfill and work in trenches which do not exceed four feet
in depth at any point (see FOH 33h17(c)(1)). </p><p>(2)  HO 17 prohibits minors from working in occupations in
excavating for buildings or other structures, or working in such excavations
[except they may manually excavate to a depth not exceeding four feet below any
ground surface adjoining the excavation and they may work in any excavation not
exceeding four feet or where the side walls are shored or sloped to the angle
of repose (see FOH 33h17(c)(2)).</p><p>(3)  HO 17 prohibits minors from working in tunnels prior
to the completion of all driving and shoring operations. </p><p>(4)  HO 17 prohibits minors from working within shafts
prior to the completion of all sinking and shoring operations.</p><p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b></p><p>(1)  Trenches.  Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may manually
excavate, manually backfill, and work in trenches which do not exceed four feet
in depth at any point. </p><p>(2)  Excavating for buildings and other structure</p><p>a.    
Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may
manually excavate to a depth not exceeding four feet below any ground surface
adjoining the excavation.</p><p>b.    
Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may work
in an excavation not exceeding a depth of four feet. </p><p>c.    
Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may
working in an excavation where the side walls are shored or sloped to the angle
of repose.</p><p>(3)  HO 17 does not apply to site clearing or surface
grading operations, nor to dredging and bore-hole drilling operations. </p><p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p><p>HO 17 does contain an exemption for student-learners and apprentices. 
There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.</p><p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>Road graders</p><p>The use of road graders (power-driven earth moving equipment) in
excavation operations is prohibited by HO 17.  The study conducted by the
Department that established HO 17 did not include surface grading operations
(i.e. use of road graders).  However, as HO 17 only permits manual excavation
or backfilling and only at a depth of up to four feet – and road graders
constitute mechanized excavation, often in ditches up to six feet in depth – the
use of road graders is prohibited.</p>
