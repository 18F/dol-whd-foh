<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHAct) was enacted to ensure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women. The OSHAct is a law with broad applicability, and is generally interpreted and enforced either directly by the Department of Labor&#x2019;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), or by an OSHA approved State Plan state agency (see FOH 36a02).</p>
<p><a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/651'>29 USC 651</a>, et seq.; <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/655'>29 U.S.C 655</a> &amp; 657; <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1903.03'>29 CFR 1903.03(a)</a></p></li>
<li><p>Pursuant to section 6 of the OSHAct, OSHA issued regulations (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1928.110'>29 CFR 1928.110</a> and 1910.142) establishing minimum standards for field sanitation (FS) and temporary labor camps (TLC) in covered agricultural settings. A detailed discussion of the FS requirements appears in section 36d of this chapter, and the TLC requirements appear in section 36e.</p>

<li><p>Following a pilot project involving the exchange of certain enforcement responsibilities between the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) and OSHA, and pursuant to Secretary&#x2019;s Order 5-96 (see 62 Fed. Reg. 107), the authority to conduct inspections, issue citations and propose penalties and to develop and issue compliance interpretations regarding FS and TLC requirements to enforce compliance by agricultural employers under sections 8, 9, and 10 of the OSHAact was transferred from OSHA to WHD. However, OSHA retained rulemaking authority for FS and TLC under section 6 of the OSHAct. The effective date of this transfer was February 3, 1997.</p>

<h4 id="a01---purpose.">36a01 - Purpose.</h4>
<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Act was enacted &#x201C;to ensure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions&#x2026;&#x201D; Absent or inadequate sanitation and hygiene has long been recognized by medical science as a principal factor in the transmission of bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases. Inadequate water supply and human waste removal have been shown to produce critical health problems. Provision of potable drinking water, the proper disposal of human wastes, and the use of personal and public hygienic practices are known to prevent heat related illnesses and the transmission of many communicable diseases. Thus, the provision of sanitation facilities is necessary to ensure safe and healthy working conditions.</p>

<p>Generally, agricultural employees of an agricultural employer are covered by the OSHAct, and OSHA has promulgated several standards for the protection of the safety and health of agricultural workers (<a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/null'>29 CFR 1928</a>). These standards include rules for sanitation facilities in the field (<a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1928.110'>29 CFR 1928.110</a>). A separate OSHA standard requires sanitation facilities in temporary labor camps (<a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1910.142'>29 CFR 1910.142</a>).</p>
<p>When conducting an OSHA Field Sanitation inspection/investigation statutory coverage must first be established followed by regulatory coverage under <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1910.142'>29 CFR 1910.142</a> and 1928.110.</p>
<p>52 Fed. Reg. 16050-01, 1987 WL 142266 (F.R.)</p>
<h4 id="b01---agricultural-employer.">36b01 - Agricultural Employer.</h4>
<p>An agricultural employer is defined as &#x201C;any person, corporation, association, or other legal entity that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>Owns or operates an agricultural establishment;</p></li>
<li><p>Contracts with the owner or operator of an agricultural establishment in advance of production for the purchase of a crop and exercises substantial control over production; or</p></li>
<li><p>Recruits and supervises employees or is responsible for the management and condition of an agricultural establishment.&#x201D;</p>
<p>An agricultural establishment is defined as &#x201C;a business operation that uses paid employees in the production of food, fiber, or other materials such as seed, seedlings, plants or parts of plants.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Specified as employers are those who both recruit and supervise employees, (e.g. many crew leaders and harvest companies), as well as those who are responsible for the management and condition of an agricultural establishment. Additionally, an advance purchaser of a crop or a substantial part of a crop who exercises substantial control over production is specified to be an employer. OSHA sought to hold jointly and severally responsible for compliance those who are best able to assure that adequate sanitation facilities and potable water are provided to farm workers in the fields.</p>
<p>52 Fed. Reg. 16050-01, 1987 WL 142266 (F.R.)</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="b02---statutory-coverage.">36b02 - Statutory Coverage.</h4>
<p>Statutory coverage under the OSHAct exists where there is a person who meets the definition of an employer who employs at least one employee. Under Sec. 3 of the OSHAct, person is defined as &#x201C;&#x2026;one or more individuals, partnerships, associations, corporations, business trusts, legal representatives, or any organized group of persons.&#x201D; An employer &#x201C;means a person engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees,&#x201D; and an employee &#x201C;means an employee of an employer who is employed in a business of his employer which affects commerce.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Commerce means trade, traffic, commerce, transportation, or communication among the several States, or between a State and any place outside thereof, or within the District of Columbia, or a possession of the United Sates, or between points in the same State but through a point outside thereof. As used in the OSHAct, the terms affects commerce and affecting commerce are, for all intents and purposes, synonymous. (Note: Affects commerce appears in the statutory definition of employee, and affecting commerce is in the definition of employer.) Although not defined in the statute, both affects commerce and affecting commerce describe the breadth of activities relative to commerce which govern whether the Act applies.</p>
<p>Conceptually, the terms affects and affecting commerce include, but are more expansive than, the FLSA term engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce. OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC - see FOH 36f), and the courts have consistently construed affects and affecting commerce so as to have the broadest possible application.</p>
<p>In summary, in order to determine whether the OSHAct applies to a given agricultural employer, the employer needs to be engaging in commerce or affecting commerce. This is somewhat broader than the FLSA language &#x201C;engaged in commerce.&#x201D; An employer not &#x201C;engaging in commerce&#x201D; could be considered to affect commerce. Secondly, the agricultural establishment must be an employer, and lastly, the employer must have employees who affect commerce. Note that the concept of employee is controlled by what the employer does, not by what the employee does.</p>
<p>Nothing in the OSHAct&#x2019;s coverage is conceptually parallel to individual coverage under the FLSA. Also, no dollar volume test exists under OSHAct. It applies to employers regardless of their annual dollar volume of business. It also apples to employers who would be otherwise exempt from the provisions of MSPA, (i.e. the family farm exemption). No comparable exemptions exist under the OSHAct.</p>
<p>Statutory coverage cannot be presumed, it must be affirmatively established and documented for every case. Once statutory coverage is established, it must be determined whether the employer is subject to either (or both) the FS and TLC regulations.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/651'>29 USC 651</a>, et. seq.</p>
<h4 id="b03---regulatory-coverage.">36b03 - Regulatory Coverage.</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>After establishing statutory coverage, coverage under <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1928.110'>29 CFR 1928.110</a> needs to be established. Agricultural employers that have employed 11 or more workers &#x201C;on any given day in hand-labor operations in the field&#x201D; during the preceding 12 months must provide field sanitation facilities.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1928.110'>29 CFR 1928.110(a)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The time span used to determine the number of employees controlled by the employer shall be the single highest number employed at any one time over the past 12 months. Only those employees who fall within the definition of &#x201C;hand-labor operations&#x201D; are to be counted. Particular attention should be given to the excluded field or field-related activities when counting covered employees, as defined at <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1928.110'>29 CFR 1928.110(a)(iii)</a>. At least 11 or more employees have to be working in the field on any single day within the past 12 months. Family members of the employer are not counted for the purpose of determining whether there are eleven hand laborers in the field. Finally, the 11 or more workers may have worked in separate fields, and the number of employees is day specific (i.e., not a collective or cumulative count). The number of employees employed on the date that the investigation does not determine coverage unless that number equals 11 or more workers.</p>
<p>See 52 Fed. Reg. 16084; 02/06/1989 OSHA Memorandum</p></li>
<li><p>Hand-labor Operations: Only employees engaged in hand-labor agricultural activities or agricultural operations, and only those employees engaged in hand-labor operations are to be counted towards the eleven or more workers. Hand-labor operations refer to agricultural activities or agricultural operations performed by hand or with hand tools. Except for purposes of <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1928.110'>29 CFR 1928.110(c)(2)(iii)</a>, the term also includes other activities or operations performed in conjunction with hand labor in the field. Activities such as hand-cultivation, hand-weeding, hand-planting and hand-harvesting of vegetables, nuts, fruits, seedlings or other crops, and the hand-packing of produce into containers, whether done on the ground, on a moving machine or in a temporary packing shed located in the field, are all examples of hand-labor operations. Hand-labor is defined as activities &#x201C;on the ground, on a moving machine or in a temporary packing shed located in the field.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Machine Operators: Those operating machines in conjunction with hand-laborers, such as tractor drivers pulling the platform from which the hand-labor occurs, are also covered. For example, if an employer has a tractor effectively working as part of a crew in a field, the tractor operator is to be treated as a hand laborer for the purpose of calculating the number of hand laborers working in the field.</p>

<h4 id="b04---joint-employmentjoint-responsibility.">36b04 - Joint Employment/Joint Responsibility.</h4>
<p>The OSHAct defines an employer as a person engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees ... (<a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/652'>29 USC 652(5)</a>). Congress intended the Act to reach as far as its commerce power constitutionally permits and thus intended employer to be defined as broadly as possible to protect every working man and woman. <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/651'>29 USC 651(b)</a>; Usery v. Lacy, 628 F.2d 1226 (9th Cir. 1980); <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1975.3'>29 CFR 1975.3(a)</a>.</p>
<p>The preamble to OSHA&#x2019;s Field Sanitation standard (FS) makes it clear that the Agency intended to include as employers all persons who could be considered employers under ...the OSHAct. In broadly defining agricultural employer, the Agency sought to hold jointly and severally responsible for compliance those who are best able to assure that adequate sanitation facilities and potable water are provided to farmworkers in the fields. (52 Fed. Reg. 16050, 16086; May 1, 1987).</p>

<p>Reforestation &#x2013; the provisions of the field sanitation standards are applicable to reforestation activities. It is similar to other agricultural field operations. Several courts have held that employees engaged in reforestation are covered by legislation for the protection of agricultural workers, and finally, the most common method of performing reforestation activities is by hand-labor operations.</p>

<p>Pine straw is the fresh, undecomposed pine needles that have fallen from pine trees. It is produced commercially and collected for use as a mulch and groundcover. The raking, gathering, baling and loading of pine straw for commercial purposes is usually performed in pine stands or plantations, from pine trees being grown for forestry and lumbering operations.</p>
<p>Pine stand owners qualify as agricultural employers because they own or operate pine stands or pine plantations, which qualify as agricultural establishments. Pine straw workers generally qualify for the protections of the OSHAct field sanitation standards when the agricultural establishment employs 11 or more workers on any one day during the previous 12 months to perform &#x201C;hand labor&#x201D; field work. Workers performing such work in different fields at the same establishment should be included in the employee count for determining coverage.</p>
<p>The Department has determined that the OSHAct field sanitation standards apply to employer operations who employ employees in hand-labor operations necessary to the gathering pine straw for sale as a commodity.</p>

OSHA intends the term accessibly located to mean &#x201C;easily reached without crossing an unbridged stream, a super highway, or any natural or man-made barrier to reach the toilet and handwashing facility.</p>
<p>Some fields for example may be located on steep mountain sides, river deltas or wetlands and the like, into or on which portable facilities cannot be located. Where the one-quarter-mile walk requirement cannot be met due to terrain, the facilities should be placed as near as physically possible to the workers which under such circumstances would be at the point of closest vehicular access. However, the size of a field, in and of itself, is not a factor in determining whether due to terrain, it is not possible to place the facilities within a one quarter mile walking distance.</p>

<p>Employers who charge for field sanitation facilities are subject to citation and penalties under the OSHAct. Where the evidence supports a finding that an employer charged the cost for providing required facilities to the employees, the WHI should inform the employer that such charges are unlawful and seek restitution for the affected workers.</p>
<p>In addition, charging for field sanitation facilities violates the FLSA obligation to pay the minimum wage if it takes the employee&#x2019;s wages below FLSA MW in a non-overtime workweek; such deductions cannot be made in overtime workweeks to an employee who is entitled to FLSA OT compensation (e.g. potentially reforestation workers) (see FOH32j08). The same principle applies to H-2A covered workers: such deductions cannot take H-2A covered workers below the H-2A required wage; in addition to a potential wage violation, it may also be failure to comply with other laws. If the cost is passed on to the workers via deduction from pay, it may be a violation of MSPA&#x2019;s obligation to pay wages owed when due since illegal deductions cannot be taken. A MSPA violation for failing to disclose all terms and conditions of employment may also exist if the workers were not properly notified of the cost to the workers (albeit illegal) for the facilities. Whether such a charge constitutes an impermissible deduction under other laws and regulations enforced by the WHD shall be determined based upon the requirements of the law and regulation.</p>

<h4 id="e00---introduction.">36e00 - Introduction.</h4>
<p>Migrant agricultural worker temporary housing inspections normally will be conducted under MSPA, (see FOH Chapter 36) or the H-2A program requirements pertaining to housing (see FOH Chapter 38). It is recommended that the WHI first determine whether or not temporary labor camp housing standards can be enforced under MSPA or H-2A. Generally, enforcement of the temporary labor camp standards (i.e., <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1910.142'>29 CFR 1910.142</a>) should be carried out under the MSPA statutory authority or H-2A program of the INA if the employer is subject to those requirements. However, if the employer housing is located within a State for which WHD has jurisdiction under the OSHAct and it is uncertain whether or not MSPA coverage applies or if the provider of the housing can claim a MSPA exemption - or if the violations involve risks to health and safety that warrant the application of the remedies available under OSHAct, the investigation shall be conducted under WHD&#x2019;s OSHAct authority. It is not appropriate to cite and sanction violations under different Acts for the same violation(s).</p>
<p>Note that S/O 5-96 specifies that WHD temporary labor camp enforcement under the OSHAct is limited to those agricultural establishments where employees are engaged in &#x201C;agricultural employment&#x201D; as defined by MSPA at <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1802'>29 USC 1802(3)</a> (See also <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/500.20'>29 CFR 500.20(e)</a>), regardless of the number of employees, including employees engaged in hand packing of produce into containers, whether done on the ground, on a moving machine, or in a temporary packing shed, except OSHA retains jurisdiction over agricultural temporary labor camps for employees engaged in egg, poultry, or red meat production, or post-harvest processing of agricultural or horticultural commodities. Again, WHD authority under the OSHAct is not limited to whether the workers are migrant or seasonal agricultural workers as those terms are defined under the MSPA &#x2013; but whether the work being performed by the workers constitutes &#x201C;agricultural employment&#x201D; as that term is defined under MSPA.</p>
