<li><p>Among those sales which are considered to be sales made to a customer who is not engaged in the “mining, manufacturing, transportation, or communications business” are sales to the following (see also WH Publication 1043 - IB 781.14): wholesale and warehouse businesses which do not manufacture but merely serve as wholesale distributors, gasoline stations (regardless of ownership), grain commission offices, and military bases such as Air Force bases, naval stations, and the like.</p></li>

This exemption was not changed by the 1974 Amendments.</p></li>
<li><p>Effective 5/1/74 Sec 13(b)(4) provides an exemption from the OT provisions of FLSA for “any employee employed in the canning, processing, marketing, freezing, curing, storing, packing for shipment, or distributing of any kind of fish, shellfish, or other aquatic forms of animal or vegetable life, or any byproducts thereof and who receives compensation for employment in excess of 48 hours in any workweek at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.”</p></li>
<li><p>The phrase “and who receives compensation for employment in excess of 48 hours in any workweek at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed” was added to the Act by the 1974 Amendments effective 5/1/74. Consequently, prior to 5/1/74 employment within the terms of this exemption was completely exempt from OT.</p></li>
<li><p>Effective 5/1/75 Sec 13(b)(4) is amended by changing “48 hours” to “44 hours”; consequently, effective on this date OT is due after 44 hours per week. Effective 5/1/76 Sec 13(b)(4) is repealed and OT is due after 40 hours per week.</p></li>

It may also be necessary in some situations to consider the application of Secs 13(a)(5) and 13(b)(4), or a combination or exemptions.</p></li>
<li><p>The applying Sec 13(a)(5), the activities named in the exemption and such other activities as are so functionally related to the named operations that they are, as a practical matter, necessarily and directly a part of the named operations are considered to be exempt activities. Thus, the repairing and cleaning of fish ponds, the fertilization and breeding of fish, and the sorting of fish are exempt activities. Also exempt, when performed as an integral part of the above operations (see IB 784.113), would be the maintenance and repair of the tools and equipment used in the above operations . The construction of new ponds or buildings is not an exempt activity under Sec 13(a)(5).</p></li>
<li><p>The principles set out in IB 784.106, 784.127, and 784.153 shall be followed in applying the Secs 13(a)(5) and 13(b)(4) exemptions to clerical employees of “fish farms”. In this connection, the maintenance of records which are an integral part of the Sec 13(a)(5) exempt fish farming activities, such as the maintenance of breeding records, records of feed consumption related to fish production and the like, would be considered as exempt activities under Sec 13(a)(5).</p></li>

<li><p>Effective 5/1/74, Sec 13(b) (28) exempts from the OT provisions of the FLSA “any employee employed in planting or tending trees, cruising, surveying or felling timber, or in preparing or transporting logs or other forestry products to the mill, processing plant, railroad, or other transportation terminal, if the number of employees employed by his employer in such forestry or lumbering operations does not exceed eight”. (Emphasis added by underscoring.)</p></li>
<li><p>For the period 2/1/67 - 4/30/74, the wording of old Sec 13 (a)(13) was identical to current Sec 13(b)(28); however, Sec 13(a)(13) was both a MW and OT exemption.</p></li>
<li><p>Prior to 2/1/67 the wording of Sec 13(a)(15) was identical to Sec 13(a)(13) except that the number of employees read “does not exceed twelve” instead of “does not exceed eight”. (Emphasis added.)</p></li>
<li><p>Under the Act as amended, the exemption continues to be in applicable in any w/w where the number of employees employed by the employer in the named operations exceeds twelve. The MW standard of Sec 6(a)(l) and OT after 40 hours applies to such employment. Beginning 5/1/74, in any w/w where all the tests of Sec 13(b)(28) are met except that the number of employees exceeds eight but does not exceed twelve, the exemption does not apply and the MW standard of Sec 6(b) and OT after 40 hours apply. In any w/w where all the tests of the exemption are met, the MW rate of Sec 6(b) applies and the employment is exempt from OT.</p></li>
<li><p>The principles in IB 788 shall be followed in applying Sec 13(b)(28) effective 5/1/74 and old Secs 13(a)(13) and 13(a)(15) prior to 5/1/74, and for rate purposes; the number twelve shall be substituted for the number eight as appropriate. In the same manner the principles stated in FOH 25e01 through 25e08 are applicable for purposes of Secs 13(a)(13), 13(a)(15), and 13(b)(28).</p></li>

Consequently, if the total number of employees employed in a particular w/w in both the individual and corporate logging operations named in the exemption exceeds 8, (or 12 under old Sec 13(a)(15) prior to 2/1/67) the exemptions are inapplicable to any of the employees for that w/w. This is so regardless of whether the two operations are conducted independently in that there is no interchange of employees or equipment.</p>
<h4 id="e02.-effect-of-number-of-employees-of-employer-on-forestry-and-logging-exemptions."><strong>25e02. Effect of number of employees of employer on forestry and logging exemptions.</strong></h4>
<p>The exemptions apply to the employees engaged in the logging operations named in the exemptions even though their employer has 9 (or 13 under old Sec 13(a.)(15)) or more employees, so long as only 8 (or 12 under old Sec 13(a)(15)) or fewer of the employees are employed in the named logging operations for the particular w/w. Thus, if an employer employs only 8 (or 12 under old Sec l3(a)(l5) employees in the named logging operations, and employs other employees in operations not named in the exemption, such as sawmill operations, the exemptions are not defeated because of the fact that he employs more than 8 (or 12 under old Sec 13(a)(15)) employees altogether. The exemptions will not apply, however, to those employees employed in operations not named in the exemption. (See IB 788.14.)</p>
<h4 id="e03.-employees-to-be-counted-in-applying-the-forestry-and-logging-exemptions."><strong>25e03. Employees to be counted in applying the forestry and logging exemptions.</strong></h4>
<p>The forestry and logging exemptions are limited to those employees employed in the operations named in the exemptions, which operations include “the incidental activities normally performed by persons employed in them” (IB 788.6). Crew supervisors (even though exempt under Reg 541), cooks, kitchen helpers, bull cooks, timekeepers, and repair shop mechanics of a logging camp are engaged in such incidental activities and are the usual members of crews which go into the woods for the purpose of felling timber and preparing and transporting logs. Therefore, these employees must be counted in determining the number of employees the employer has engaged in forestry and logging operations. If the total number of employees so engaged exceeds eight (12 under old Sec 13(a)(15)) when crew supervisors, cooks, kitchen helpers, bullcooks, timekeepers, and repair shop mechanics are counted, the exemptions do not apply.</p>
<p><strong>25e04. Employees in planing and sawmill operations not exempt.</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Employees in a planing mill or in a sawmill, including such portable mills in the woods, are performing operations connected with the processing of logs and, therefore, are not exempt.</p></li>
<li><p>Employees of a mill or a contract carrier who truck logs from the woods to the mill are engaged in a named operation (transporting logs to the mill) and are within the exemptions if the other tests are met. Transporting lumber from the mill is not an exempt operation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>25e05. Construction of access logging roads and trails.</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Employees engaged in building minor access roads, such as “plank” roads, “corduroy” roads, and similar relatively simple roads for the transportation of logs from the felling site to a central collection point, may be exempt. Another example is the cutting of a trail, known as a “skid road”, through the woods for the removal of logs dragged by a tractor or snaked out by a cable attached to a donkey engine. Such a road may require minor clearing operations, including the removal of underbrush, stumps, and trees to give the necessary access.</p></li>
<li><p>Exempt road building is that sort normally done by the members of a logging crew. Employees who are employed in constructing major logging roads, and employees building roads normally built by persons who specialize in building roads, are not engaged in forestry or logging operations within the meaning of the exemptions. Major logging roads are those from the central collecting points to the mill.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="e06.-forest-nurseries."><strong>25e06. Forest nurseries.</strong></h4>
<p>Forest nurseries grow seedlings specifically for forest or woodland planting, and are distinguished from ordinary landscape nurseries by the fact that they usually make large-quantity sales of low-priced young seedlings, rather than small-quantity sales of more expensive and older trees. Generally, employees engaged in seeding new beds and transplanting seedlings in a forest tree nursery for eventual forest planting come within the forestry and logging exemptions, provided the limitation on the number of employees is met by the employer. Such employees are not engaged in “agriculture”.</p>
<h4 id="e07.-logging-incidental-to-land-clearing-or-sawmilling."><strong>25e07. Logging incidental to land clearing or sawmilling.</strong></h4>
<p>The exemptions apply to employees who felled timber or transport logs to the mill, regardless of the fact that the logging or transporting may be incidental to land clearing or sawmilling operations . However, the trees felled must be timber, that is, material for construction or processing. The exemptions do not apply, in a land clearing project, where the felled trees are burned or hauled away for dumping, nor does it apply to tree trimming along power line rights-of-way.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The exemption from OT provided by FLSA Sec 7(j) for employers engaged in the operation of a hospital is explained in Sec 778.601 of IB Part 778. This section supplements IB 778.601.</p></li>
<li><p>The exemption in Sec 7(j) applies to employees of employers engaged in the activities comprising the operation of a hospital.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Employees of the hospital entity.</p>
<p>Employees employed by the hospital entity may be subject to Sec 7(j). This includes not only the typical hospital employees who work in the hospital but may also include, for example, employees of an employer who owns and operates or operates pursuant to a contract more than one hospital, who are engaged in performing the following services for the hospitals: public relations, payroll, accounting, administrative services, engineering, architecture and planning, community relations, and personnel and labor relations and remodeling</p></li>
<li><p>Employees employed in hospital operations.</p>
<p>Employees in the various medical laboratories and therapy services located in the hospital and operated by the employer exclusively as an integral and essential part of the hospital may be subject to Sec 7(j). Such employees must be employed in medically related activities connected with the operation of the hospital. On the other hand where the laboratory or therapy services are only providing a service to the hospital and operate as an independent business which is not part of the hospital enterprise, Sec 7(j) will not apply to their employees because they are not deemed “employed by” an ‘employer engaged in the operation of a hospital”. Similarly, an independent contractor providing nonmedically related services, such as a contractor who provides janitorial or maintenance services to a hospital may not use Sec 7(j) since the contractor is not engaged in the medically related operations of a hospital.</p>
<p>Further, an employer engaged in the operation of a hospital may not utilize the provision to relieve himself of his obligations under Sec 7(a) of the Act with respect to any of his employees who devote a substantial part of their worktime in the w/w to activities other than those in connection with the operation of the hospital, such as custodial work for other tenants who occupy leased space in the building. Such nonexempt work wilt be considered substantial if it occupies more than 20% of the time worked by the employee in the w/w.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Employees of a temporary help company working on assignments in hospitals are considered to be jointly employed by both the temporary help company and the hospital in which they are employed. For enforcement purposes, Wage-Hour will not take exception to a claim by a hospital that Sec 7(j) applies during any 14-day period where the employees work exclusively for a single hospital provided that before performance of the work am agreement is made between the hospital and the employees to use the 14-day period in lieu of the normal w/w. This position is taken without prejudice to the rights of individual employees under Sec 16(b). On the other hand, Sec 7(j) will not apply to any employee who during a 14-day work period is employed in more than one hospital even though all such hospitals may be operating under Sec 7(j) with respect to their regular employees.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="h01.-use-of-sec-7j."><strong>25h01. Use of Sec 7(j).</strong></h4>
<p>A hospital has the option of complying with the OT provisions of Sec 7(a) or of utilizing Sec 7(j) with respect to any or all of its employees.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Sec 13(a)(3) provides an exemption from the MW and OT provisions of the FLSA for “any employee employed by an establishment which is an amusement or recreational establishment, organized camp, or religious or non-profit educational conference center if (A) it does not operate for more than seven months in any calendar year, or (B) during the preceding calendar year, its average receipts for any six months of such year were not more than 33 1/3 per centum of its average receipts for the other six months of such year”.</p></li>
<li><p>An “organized camp’ characteristically provides room and board in a rustic setting over a sustained period of time. An “organized camp” is one with a program of activities and sustained supervision, provided for a set fee. The American Camping Association defines a “camp” as “a sustained experience which provides a creative recreational and educational opportunity in group living in the out of doors. It utilizes trained leadership and the resources of natural surroundings to contribute to each camper’s mental, physical, social, and spiritual growth.”</p></li>
<li><p>A “religious or nonprofit educational conference center “is a meeting center providing for religious, educational and leadership growth experiences for both youth and adults.

<li><p>“(A) Does not operate for more than seven months In any calendar year”.</p>
<p>An amusement or recreational establishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference center will be exempt if “it does not operate for more than seven months in any calendar year”. Whether an establishment “operates” during a particular month is a question of fact, and depends on whether it operates as an amusement or recreational establishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference center. If an establishment engages only in activities such as maintenance operations or ordering supplies during the “dead season”, it is not considered to be operating for purposes of the exemption.</p></li>

Since the language of the statute refers to receipts for any six months (not necessarily consecutive months), the monthly average based on total receipts for the six individual months in which the receipts were smallest should be tested against the monthly average for six individual months when the receipts were largest to determine whether this test is me</p></li>
<li><p>To illustrate the principles in (1) above, consider an amusement or recreational establishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference center that is in a covered Sec 3(s)(1) 1) enterprise as defined by the amended Act.

(the six months in which the receipts were largest) totaled $260,000, a monthly average of $43,333; the total receipts for the other six months totaled $75,000, a monthly average of $12,500. Since the average receipts of the latter six months were not more than 33 1/3% of the average receipts for the other six months of the year, the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption will apply.</p></li>

<li><p>Establishments such as those selling groceries, curios, and dry goods, as well as gas stations, hotels, motels, restaurants and the like, are generally not within the categories of establishments which are commonly recognized as inherently of an amusement or recreational character within the meaning of Sec 13(a)(3) of the Act. However, certain such establishments in national parks, forests, or the Wildlife Refuge System, are limited by policy of the Interior or Agriculture Departments to merchandising only those items and providing only those services appropriate for the public use and enjoyment of the areas administered by them. These establishments operate under an exclusive contract with these Departments and only during the season when these areas are open to the public. Under these circumstances, the activities of these establishments are considered to have a sufficiently intimate relation to the operation of these recreational areas to warrant their characterization as “amusement or recreational” establishments.</p></li>
<li><p>As provided in Sec 13(a)(3), this exemption from MW (Sec 6) and OT (Sec 7) “does not apply with respect to any employee of a private entity engaged in providing services or facilities (other than, in the case of the exemption from Sec 6, a private entity engaged in providing services and facilities directly related to skiing) in a national park or a national forest or on land in the National Wildlife Refuge System, under a contract with the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture;”</p></li>
<li><p>However, such employees, although subject to the MW, may qualify for a partial exemption from OT as provided in Sec 13(b)(29):</p>

<li><p>For purposes of applying Sec 13(a)(3), the general principles set forth in IB 779.308 - 779.311 apply. Thus an employee, to be exempt, must be “employed by” the exempt establishment. In some situations, such as an amusement park, baseball park, or racetrack, food and souvenir vendors are employed by a concessionaire on the premises. If the operations of the concessionaire constitute a separate establishment, the tests of Sec 13(a)(3) are applied to the concessionaire’s establishment separately without regard to the operations of the host establishment. On the other hand, if the concessionaire and host constitute a single establishment, as is usually the case, the tests apply on the basis of all the operations of the establishment, including those of the concessionaire.

<li><p>Employment in central functions of an organization operating more than one such establishment, as in the case of employees of a central office, warehouse, garage, or commissary which serves a chain of exempt “amusement or recreational” establishments would not be within the exemption under Sec 13(a)(3).</p></li>

<h4 id="j08.-new-business---application-of-tests-a-and-b."><strong>25j08. “New business” - application of Tests A and B.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Tests A and B refer to a calendar year throughout which the operations of the establishment can be tested to determine its character as a seasonally operated place of business. In the case of a new business, Tests A and B are to be applied as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Test A.</p>
<p>Generally, Test A is not met by a new business establishment which has operated for no more than 7 months in a calendar year for the reason that its business operations did not start until a considerable portion of the year had elapsed. If, however, the character of the establishment is that of an “amusement or recreational establishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference center” whose operations are shown by acceptable evidence to be subject to seasonal factors which would require the establishment to cease operations for five months or more in the calendar year even if it had been in business for the entire calendar year, the new business establishment may meet the requirements of Test A so that its employees will be exempt. For example, an employer may open a new ski slope establishment in November under circumstances where it is clear that the establishment would have operated less than seven months in the year regardless of the date it began operations. In such a case the establishment could claim the exemption under Test A.</p></li>
<li><p>Test B.</p>
<p>Test B is based on the establishment’s experience “during the preceding calendar year.” Generally this requires an entire year’s experience to apply Test B in order to make the necessary calculation. However, in the case of a new business where there is no “preceding calendar year” on which to apply Test B, WH will apply the following criteria in determining the applicability of Sec 13(a)(3)(B):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>If the enterprise of which the new establishment is a part operates other seasonal amusement or recreational establishments, organized camps, or religious or nonprofit educational conference centers of the same type in the same general area under substantially the same conditions and all such establishments conclusively and clearly meet the condition of Test B; or</p></li>
<li><p>If such employer does not have other such establishments but other employers operating the same type of establishment in the same general area under substantially the same conditions and manner of operation clearly are entitled to exemption under Test B.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Wage-Hour will consider the exemption applicable in the year the new establishment begins operation if either of these tests are met provided, however, that in the event after a year’s operation the establishment does not qualify under Test B, proper MW and OT is paid retroactively.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="j09.-summer-programs-of-schools."><strong>25j09. Summer programs of schools.</strong></h4>
<p>Some elementary or secondary schools or institutions of higher education which are academically accredited during the fall through spring semesters operate establishments that provide summer recreation or summer camp programs. Where such programs meet the requirements of Sec 13(a)(3)(A) or (B) and are not a part, continuation, or extension of the accredited academic program of the school, such an establishment may qualify as “an amusement or recreational establishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference center” pursuant to the exemption, even though some credit courses may be offered on a voluntary basis along with the recreational activities. The applicability of Sec 13(a)(3) to employees of such an establishment is not defeated by the fact that the same distinct physical place of business is for part of the year a “school” and for part of the year “an amusement or recreational establishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference center.”</p>
<h4 id="j10.-application-of-exemption-to-state-and-local-government-facilities."><strong>25j10. Application of exemption to State and local government facilities.</strong></h4>
<p>Golf courses, swimming pools, summer camps, ice skating rinks, and similar establishments are the type which may qualify for exemption under Sec 13(a)(3). Activities conducted during the summer months in a city’s parks such as playground activities, arts and crafts, sports programs, and related activities which are in operation for not more than 7 months of the year may also come within this exemption. Playground counselors, arts and crafts instructors, and games leaders are the type of employees who may be exempt as long as they work solely in a park or parks in such exempt activities. Of course, as provided in FOH 25j04(b), the exemption is not applicable to central office employees of the parks or recreation department or to maintenance crews who operate out of a central facility responsible for the maintenance and cleaning of all the city’s parks.</p>
<h4 id="j11.-beach-and-boardwalk-facilities."><strong>25j11. Beach and boardwalk facilities.</strong></h4>
<p>If the tests are met, the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption for amusement parks and recreational areas is applicable in the case of either private or public amusement and recreational activities directly related to the operation of a beach and boardwalk. Lifeguards on a beach, drivers of a motorized train along a boardwalk, and comfort station attendants at those stations operated solely for the convenience of the persons patronizing the beach come within this exemption. In the case of a public agency, those employees solely employed in the cleaning of the beach may also come within the exemption as long as they are not engaged in any work related to the cleaning of the city’s streets or other parks (see FOH 25j04(b)).</p>
<h4 id="j12.-receipts-of-state-or-local-government-operated-amusement-or-recreational-establishments."><strong>25j12. “Receipts” of State or local government-operated amusement or recreational establishments.</strong></h4>
<p>Sec 13(a)(3)(B) contains certain percentage tests for “receipts” of the establishment. As used here, receipts are fees received from admissions. A state or local government-operated amusement or recreational establishment whose operating costs are met wholly or primarily from tax funds would fail to qualify under Sec 13(a)(3)(B). However, such an establishment may qualify under Sec 13(a)(3)(A).</p>
<h4 id="j13.-employees-of-an-exempt-establishment---construction-activities."><strong>25j13. Employees of an exempt establishment - construction activities.</strong></h4>
<p>Employees of a Sec 13(a)(3) exempt establishment who engage in construction or reconstruction work do not qualify for the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption in any w/w in which they are so engaged. For example, employees of an amusement park who, in addition to their maintenance and repair work, engage in the erection of new structures, buildings, and places of entertainment designed to continue the public’s interest, are not within the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption in any w/w that some (there is no tolerance for such nonexempt work) construction work is performed. (See also FOH 21k07.)</p>
<h4 id="j14.-state-and-county-fairs."><strong>25j14. State and county fairs.</strong></h4>
<p>The activities of the usual State or county fair are analogous to those of an amusement park, carnival, or circus, i.e., it has rides, exhibitions, side shows, etc., and its revenues are derived principally from selling admissions to such events. State and county fairs may thus qualify for the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption if the tests are met.</p>
<h4 id="j15.-campsites-and-campgrounds."><strong>25j15. Campsites and campgrounds.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Campsites and campgrounds provide facilities where the general public may camp in tents, campers, recreational vehicles, travel trailers, or motor homes. They may include paved driveways and furnish water, waste and electrical outlets, picnic benches and tables, restrooms and showers, laundry facilities, ice houses, bottled gas and grocery facilities, and provide for handling mail and various recreational pursuits. The camping season usually runs from the end of May through the Labor Day weekend, but in milder climates some campgrounds have a longer season and others are open year-round.</p></li>
<li><p>An exempt campsite or campground operates and maintains its establishment as a functional amusement or recreational unit, i.e., providing facilities for camping as a recreational activity. It may provide swimming, boating, or fishing facilities as well as facilities for various other amusement or recreational activities such as volleyball, horseshoes, miniature golf, movies, dances, contests, bonfires, and the like. It may be located on either state or local government or private land. Such a campsite or campground may be considered an amusement or recreational establishment for the purpose of Sec 13(a)(3) and tested for exemption under clause (A) or (B) of that section.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, if a campsite or campground merely provides space and parking facilities which the travelling public uses while in transit to a recreational area (as opposed to (b) above), the campsite or campground is not an amusement or recreational establishment for purposes of Sec 13(a)(3). At such a facility the travelling public usually stays for only a short period of time such as one or two nights.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="j16.-drive-in-theaters."><strong>25j16. Drive-in theaters.</strong></h4>
<p>Drive-in theaters may qualify for the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption if either of the tests is met.</p>
<h4 id="j17.-riverboat-cruises."><strong>25j17. Riverboat cruises.</strong></h4>
<p>Businesses engaged in conducting riverboat cruises for sightseeing and entertainment purposes may qualify for the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption where the tests for the exemption are met and the majority of the firm’s revenue is derived from ticket sales and entertainment, rather than food, drink, concessions, and gifts. For purposes of applying the exemption, treat riverboats, docking, and ticketing facilities as one establishment.</p>

<h4 id="k00.-statutory-provisions."><strong>25k00. Statutory provisions.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Effective 5/1/74, sec 13 (a)(15) provides a MW and OT exemption for “any employee employed on a casual basis in domestic service employment to provide babysitting services or any employee employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for individuals who (because of age or infirmity) are unable to care for themselves (as such terms are defined and delimited by regulations of the Secretary).”</p></li>
<li><p>Regulations will be issued to define and delimit these terms</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="k01.-personal-health-care-at-home."><strong>25k01. Personal health care at home.</strong></h4>
<p>Trained personnel such as nurses, whether registered or practical, are not exempt under Sec 13(a)(15). See also FOH 10c16. However, registered nurses may be exempt as professional employees under See 13(a)(1) depending on the facts.</p>
<h4 id="k02.-persons-attending-invalid-infants-and-young-children."><strong>25k02. Persons attending invalid infants and young children.</strong></h4>
<p>Individuals other than trained personnel such as nurses (see FOH 25k01) who attend invalid infants and young children are considered companions, rather than babysitters, and the employment thus may be within the Sec 13(a)(15) exemption. (See Reg 552.106.)</p>

<h4 id="l00.-statutory-provisions."><strong>25L00. Statutory provisions.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Effective 1/1/75, Sec 7(k) of the amended Act provides a partial OT exemption for any employee of a public agency engaged in fire protection activities or any employee engaged in law enforcement activities (including security personnel in correctional institutions) if -</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>in a work period of 28 consecutive days the employee receives for tours of duty which in the aggregate exceed 240 hours; or</p></li>

</ol></li>
<li><p>Effective 1/1/76, OT compensation must be paid for hours in excess of 232 in a work period of 28 days (58 hours in a work period of 7 days) or in the case of any work period between 7 and 28 days, a proportionate number of hours in such work period.</p></li>

<h4 id="l01.-weigh-station-inspectors."><strong>25L01. Weigh station inspectors.</strong></h4>
<p>Weigh station inspectors, even though given certain “general police powers”, are not engaged in an activity within the traditional meaning of the term “law enforcement activities” and therefore do not qualify for the Sec 7(k) exemption.</p>
<h4 id="l02.-trading-time."><strong>25L02. Trading time.</strong></h4>
<p>The criteria for trading time on regularly scheduled tours of duty are contained in Reg 553.18. It is our position that the period within which time traded must be paid back is not confined to a specific calendar or fiscal year. Each increment of traded time must, however, be paid back within 365 days (12 months) from the day the time was actually traded unless the death, severance, or retirement of the employee owed for the time occurs sooner.</p>
<h4 id="l03.-public-agency-security-personnel-handling-convicts."><strong>25L03. Public agency security personnel handling convicts.</strong></h4>
<p>Any employee of any public agency who performs the duties described in Reg 553.4(e), i.e., the responsibility of maintaining and controlling the custody of prisoners and guarding them, may qualify for the Sec 7(k) exemption. It is not necessary, for example, that the employees be employed by a department of public safety or similar public agency in order to be exempt. The employee may be employed by a highway department, recreation department, etc. Further, “ security personnel in correctional institutions” need not meet the tests specified in Reg 553.4(a)(l), 553.4(a)(2) and 553.4(a)(3) to qualify under Sec 7(k). A “correctional institution” is defined to mean any Government facility maintained as part of the penal system for the incarceration or detention of persons suspected or convicted of having breached the peace or committed some other crime. “Security personnel” does not include nurses, janitors, cooks, recreational directors, etc.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: With regard to FOH 25p00, a word of explanation is in order. Sec 13(b)(24)(A) is followed by the word “and” rather than the word “or” which appears in the FLSA as amended. The reason we have done this in the FOH is because extensive and exhaustive research has made clear that the ‘74 Amendments contained an error in wording. That is, in order to remain logically consistent with all that was stated on the Record concerning this exemption, it is obvious that the word “and” rather than “or” should have been printed between points (A) and (B):</p>
<p>see p. 10, Sec 17 of Public Law 93-259 in FOH Vol I. Thus, it has been determined that the word “and’ is correct and should be used in construing the exemption. That is why we put “and” in FOP. 25p00, and also why there are no quotation marks at the beginning and end of the exemption, since it is not an exact quotation.</p>
