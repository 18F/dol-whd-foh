              <p>(a)   Certain
special rules apply to employees of local educational agencies, which include
public school boards and public and private elementary and secondary schools. 
The special rules do not apply to other kinds of educational institutions, such
as colleges and universities, trade schools, and preschools.</p><p>(b)   Local
educational agencies are covered by the FMLA (and these special rules).  They
are covered employers under the FMLA.  The FMLA’s 50-employee coverage test
does not apply.  However, the usual requirements for employees to be “eligible”
do apply, including employment at a worksite where at least 50 employees are
employed within 75 miles.  See FOH 39c.</p><p>(c)   The
special rules affect instructional employees taking intermittent leave, leave
on a reduced leave schedule, or leave near the end of an academic term. 
“Instructional employees” are those whose principal function is to teach and
instruct students in a class, a small group, or an individual setting.  This
includes not only teachers, but also athletic coaches, driving instructors, and
special education assistants such as signers for the hearing impaired.  It does
not include teacher assistants or aides who do not have as their principal job
actual teaching or instructing, nor does it include auxiliary personnel such as
counselors, psychologists, curriculum specialists, cafeteria workers,
maintenance workers, or bus drivers.</p><p>(d)   The special
rules outlined below that apply to restoration to an equivalent position apply

leave.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Leave
taken by an instructional employee for a period that ends with the school year
and begins the next semester is leave taken consecutively rather than
intermittently.  The period during the summer vacation when the employee would
not have been required to report for duty is not counted against the employee’s
FMLA leave entitlement.</p><p>(b)   An
instructional employee who is on FMLA leave at the end of the school year must
be provided with any benefits over the summer vacation that employees would
normally receive if they had been working at the end of the school year.</p><p>(c)   When an
instructional employee needs intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave
schedule to care for a family member with a serious health condition, to care
for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, or for the
employee’s own serious health condition, any one of which is foreseeable based
on planned medical treatment, and the employee would be on leave for more than
20 percent of the total number of working days over the period the leave would
extend, the employer may require the employee to choose either:</p><p>(1)  Take a block of
leave for a particular period or periods not greater than the duration of the
time needed for the planned treatment; or</p><p>(2)  Transfer
temporarily to an available alternative position for which the employee is
qualified, which has equivalent pay and benefits and which better accommodates
the leave.</p><p>(d)   If an
employee chooses to take a block of leave for the duration of time needed
instead of transferring temporarily to an available alternative position, the
entire period of leave taken will count as FMLA leave.  See 29 CFR 825.603(a).</p><p>(e)   If an
instructional employee does not give the required notice of foreseeable FMLA
leave (see FOH 39f01) to be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave
schedule, the employer may require the employee to take leave of a particular
duration or to transfer temporarily to an alternative position.  Alternatively,
the employer may require the employee to delay the taking of leave until the
notice provision is met.</p><p>29 USC 2618(c)</p><p>29 CFR 825.601</p>

near the end of an academic term.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Academic
term means the school semester that typically ends near the end of the calendar
year and the end of spring.  Schools cannot have more than two academic terms
each year for the purposes of the FMLA.</p><p>(b)   If an
instructional employee begins leave more than five weeks before the end of an
academic term, the employer may require the employee to continue taking leave
until the end of the term if the leave will last at least three weeks, and the
employee would return to work during the three week period before the end of
the term.</p><p>(c)   If an
instructional employee begins leave during the five-week period before the end
of the academic term and the leave is for the birth of a child or placement of
a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a spouse, son, daughter or
parent with a serious health condition, or to care for a covered servicemember
with a serious injury or illness, the employer may require the employee to
continue leave until the end of the term if the leave will last more than two
weeks, and the employee would return to work during the two-week period before
the end of the term.</p><p>(d)   If an
instructional employee begins leave during the three-week period before the end
of the academic term and the leave is for the birth of a child or placement of
a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a spouse, son, daughter or
parent with a serious health condition, or to care for a covered servicemember
with a serious injury or illness, the employer may require the employee to
continue taking leave until the end of the term if the leave will last more
than five working days.</p><p>(e)   In the
case of an employee who is required to take leave until the end of an academic
term, only the period of leave until the employee is ready and able to return
to work can be charged against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement.  The
employer has the option not to require the employee to stay on leave until the
end of the school term; therefore any additional leave required by the employer
to the end of the school term is not counted as FMLA leave.</p><p>However, the employer
must maintain the employee's group health insurance and restore the employee to
the same or equivalent job including other benefits at the conclusion of the
leave.</p><p>29 CFR 825.603(b)</p><p>29 USC 2618(d)</p><p>29 CFR 825.602</p>

              <p>(a)   The
determination of how an employee is to be restored to an equivalent position
upon return from FMLA leave will be made on the basis of established school board
policies and practices, private school policies and practices, and collective
bargaining agreements.  Such policies or agreements must be in writing, must be
made known to the employee prior to the taking of FMLA leave, and must clearly
explain the employee's restoration rights upon return from leave.</p><p>(b)   The
taking of FMLA leave shall not result in the loss of any employment benefit
accrued prior to the date the leave begins.  For example, a probationary
teacher who takes a FMLA-qualifying leave cannot be required to begin the
probationary period again upon return to work.  The employer is not required to
allow the accrual of any additional seniority or employment benefit during the
period of unpaid leave, but must restore the employee to those benefits already
earned.</p><p>29 USC 2618(e)</p><p>29 CFR 825.604</p><p>WHD Non-Administrator

              <h3>39a00 - Statutory and regulatory
provisions.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Purpose
of the FMLA</p><p>The Family and
Medical Leave Act (FMLA, or the Act), Public Law 103-3, 107 Stat. 6
(29 USC. 2601 et seq.), was enacted on February 5, 1993, and became
effective for most covered employers on August 5, 1993.  The FMLA is intended
to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote
the stability and economic security of families, and to promote national
interests in preserving family integrity.  The Act is intended to accomplish
these purposes in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of
employers, and that is consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.</p><p>(b)   Statute</p><p>(1)  The FMLA entitles
eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for
specified family and medical reasons with continuation of group health
insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had
not taken leave.</p><p>a.     Eligible
employees are entitled to twelve (12) workweeks of leave in a 12-month period
for:</p><p>1.     The
birth of a child and to care for the newborn child within one year of birth,</p><p>2.     The
placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care and to care
for the newly placed child within one year of placement,</p><p>3.     To
care for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health
condition,</p><p>4.     A
serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the
essential functions of his or her job, and</p><p>5.     Any
qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son,
daughter, or parent is a military member on “covered active duty.”</p><p>b.     Eligible
employees who are the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a
covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness are entitled to twenty-six
(26) workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for the covered
servicemember (military caregiver leave).</p><p>29 USC 2612</p><p>29 CFR 825.112</p><p>(2)  The WHD is
responsible for administering and enforcing the FMLA for most employees.  Most
federal and certain congressional employees are also covered by the law but are
subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management or
Congress.   See FOH 39b04.</p><p>5 USC 6381 et seq.</p><p>5 CFR part 630</p><p>(c)   Amendments</p><p>(1)  The FMLA was
amended January 28, 2008 by Section 585(a) of the National Defense
Authorization Act for FY 2008, Public Law 110-181 (FY 2008 NDAA).  This
amendment expanded the FMLA to include special military family leave provisions,
i.e., “qualifying exigency” and “military caregiver” leave.</p><p>(2)  Further
amendments to the FMLA were enacted on October 28, 2009 by section 565(a) of
the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2010, Public Law 111-84 (FY 2010
NDAA), amending the military family leave provisions.</p><p>(3)  On December 21,
2009, the FMLA was amended by the Airline Flight Crew Technical Corrections
Act, Public Law 111-119 (AFCTCA), providing a special eligibility requirement for
airline flight crew members and flight attendants (“airline flight crew
employees”).</p><p>(d)   Regulations</p><p>Title 29, Part 825 of
the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is the official source for regulatory information
concerning the application of the FMLA.</p>

employers</p><p>An employer covered
by the FMLA is any person engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity
affecting commerce, who employs 50 or more employees for each working day
during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding
calendar year.  Employers who meet the FMLA 50-employee coverage requirement

commerce” within the meaning of the FMLA.</p><p>29 USC 2611(4)(A)</p><p>29 CFR 825.104(b)</p><p>(b)   “Employ”</p><p>The definition of
“employ” is the same as used in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and
includes instances when an individual is “suffered or permitted” to work.  Employees
whose names appear on the payroll are considered to be employed each working
day of the week.</p><p>29 USC 2611(3)</p><p>29 CFR 825.105(a)</p><p>(c)   Counting
employees for private employer coverage</p><p>Any employee whose
name appears on the employer’s payroll will count toward the 50-employee
coverage requirement even if the employee has received no compensation for the
week, or was on paid or unpaid leave.  Part-time employees maintained on the
payroll are considered employed for each working day of the week.  Employees on
paid or unpaid leave, including FMLA leave, leaves of absence, disciplinary
suspension, etc., are counted as long as there is a reasonable expectation that
the employee will return to active employment.  If there is no
employer/employee relationship, such as when the employee is laid-off, the
individual is not counted.</p><p>29 CFR 825.105(b) - (c)</p><p>(d)   Volunteers</p><p>Unpaid volunteers do
not appear on the payroll and do not meet the definition of an “employee” and,
therefore, are not counted when determining employer coverage or employee
eligibility.   See FOH 10b03.</p><p>WHD Non-Administrator
Letter FMLA-7 October 8, 1993</p><p>(e)   Joint and

jointly employed by two employers must be counted by both employers in
determining employer coverage and employee eligibility under the FMLA,
regardless of whether maintained on only one or both of the employers’ payrolls.</p><p>Temporary employees
are ordinarily considered to be jointly employed by both the temporary
employment agency and the worksite employer and are counted for coverage
purposes by both entities.  See FOH 39b01 and 39c03.</p><p>29 CFR 825.106</p><p>WHD Opinion Letter

with multiple departments/divisions</p><p>(1)  Corporations
are single employers under the FMLA and all employees of the corporation, at all
locations, are counted for coverage purposes.</p><p>(2)  Separate
entities or corporations may be parts of a single employer for FMLA purposes if
they meet the “integrated employer” test.  Factors to be considered in
determining if separate entities are an integrated employer include:</p><p>a.     Common
management,</p><p>b.     Interrelation

coverage status</p><p>Once a private
employer meets the 50-employee requirement for FMLA coverage, the employer
remains covered until it has no longer employed 50 employees for 20 workweeks
in the current and preceding calendar year.  For example, an employer who
employed 50 or more employees for 20 workweeks in one year would continue to be
a covered employer under the FMLA the following year even if it now employed
fewer than 50 employees because it still would meet the requirement of 50

              <p>(a)   Where two
or more businesses exercise some control over the work or working conditions of
the employee, the businesses may be joint employers under the FMLA.  The
relationship is viewed in its totality in making a determination of whether or
not a joint employment relationship exists.</p><p>(b)   A
professional employer organization (PEO) that contracts with client employers
to perform administrative functions does not enter into a joint relationship
with the employees of its                    client companies when it merely
performs administrative functions.  The determination of whether a PEO is a
joint employer depends upon the economic realities of the situation and all the
facts and circumstances.  For example, if the PEO exercises control of the
client’s employees or benefits from the work that the employees perform, such
facts may indicate that the PEO would be a joint employer with the client
employer.  Where a PEO is a joint employer, the client employer is commonly the
primary employer.<a name="1"></a></p><p>(c)   In joint
employment situations, only the primary employer is responsible for giving
required notices to its employees, providing FMLA leave, and maintaining health
benefits. Factors considered in determining which is the primary employer
include authority/responsibility to hire and fire, assign/place the employee,
make payroll, and provide employment benefits.  The primary employer is
responsible for job restoration and the secondary employer is responsible for
accepting the employee returning from leave.  For example, if the joint
employment relationship is that of temporary/leased employee and the secondary
employer continued to use the agency to fill the position, the employee is
entitled to return to the position he or she held with the secondary employer. 
If the secondary employer did not fill the position from that agency, then the
primary employer must place the employee in an equivalent position.</p><p>29 CFR 825.106</p><p>WHD Opinion Letter

              <p>(a)   The federal
government is a covered employer under the FMLA without regard to the number of
employees.  However, most federal employees are covered under Title II of the
FMLA and are not under the jurisdiction of the Wage and Hour Division.  The
Department of Labor’s enforcement authority under Title I of the FMLA excludes
any federal officer or employee covered under subchapter V of Chapter 63 of
Title 5 of the United States Code.  Such federal employees are covered by Title
II of the FMLA, which is administered by the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM), pursuant to regulations at 5 CFR part 630.</p><p>(b)   However,
the Wage and Hour Division has enforcement authority under Title I of the FMLA
for the following federal executive branch employees:</p><p>(1)  Employees of
the Postal Service,</p><p>(2)  Employees of
the Postal Regulatory Commission,</p><p>(3)  Employees of
the Federal Aviation Administration</p><p>(4)  A part-time
employee who does not have an established tour of duty, and</p><p>(5)  An employee who
is serving under an intermittent or temporary appointment with a time
limitation of one year or less.</p><p>29 CFR 825.109(b)</p><p>(c)   Additionally,
employees of other federal executive agencies not covered by Title II of the
FMLA will also be under the jurisdiction of the Wage and Hour Division.</p><p>(d)   While
employees of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Library of
Congress are covered by Title I of the FMLA, the Comptroller General of the
United States and the Librarian of Congress, respectively, have responsibility
for the administration of the FMLA with respect to these employees.</p><p>29 USC 2611(4)(A)(iv),
2617(f)</p><p>(e)   The
Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA) protects the employees of the
U.S. Congress and its associated employees. The CAA applies to the following
offices and their employees: House of Representatives (both Washington, D.C.
and state district office staff); Senate (both Washington, D.C. and state
district office staff); Capitol Police; Capitol Guide Service; Congressional
Budget Office; Office of the Architect of the Capitol; Office of the Attending
Physician; and the Office of Compliance.  The Office of Compliance is an
independent non-partisan agency established to administer and enforce the CAA.
The Office of Compliance has responsibility for the administration of the FMLA
with respect to employees covered by the CAA.</p><p>(f)   Employees
of the judicial branch of the United States are covered by Title I and under
the enforcement authority of the Wage and Hour Division if they are employed in
a unit which has employees in the competitive service, such as employees of the
U.S. Tax Court.</p><p>29 CFR 825.109</p>

12 months of employment for the employer need not be consecutive.  However, an
employer is not required to count periods of employment prior to a break in
service of seven years or more, unless the break in service is caused by the
employee’s fulfillment of a Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment
Rights Act (USERRA) covered service obligation, or a written agreement,
including a collective bargaining agreement, exists concerning the employer’s
intention to rehire the employee after the break in service.</p><p>(2)  An employer may
choose to consider employment prior to a break in service of seven years.  If
the employer chooses to recognize such periods of employment, the employer is
required to do so with respect to all employees with similar breaks in service.</p><p>(3)  The FMLA
requires employers to keep records for three years (see FOH 39k).  If the
employer retains records for the seven-year period, it may use those records in
determining the employee’s eligibility.  However, if the employer retains records
only for the required three years, it may base its initial determination on the
retained records.  If based on these records the employee is determined not to
be eligible, the employee will have to submit proof of employment in years four
through seven to demonstrate eligibility.</p><p>Such proof might include:</p><p>a.     W-2
forms,</p><p>b.     Pay
stubs,</p><p>c.     A
statement which identifies the dates of prior employment, name of employee’s

worked</p><p>For most employees,
the 1,250 hours of service is determined according to the principles under the FLSA
for determining compensable hours of work (29 CFR part 785). 
Consequently, hours not actually worked such as paid or unpaid vacation and
sick leave (including FMLA-qualifying leave), holidays and other similar time
are not counted.  Overtime hours worked are counted toward FMLA eligibility.</p><p>29 CFR 825.110(c)(1)</p><p>WHD Non-Administrator

of hours</p><p>If accurate records
are not kept, the employer has the burden of showing that the employee has not met
the hours of service requirement in order to claim the employee is not eligible
for FMLA leave.  An employer must clearly show, for example, that bona fide
exempt employees under FLSA regulations 29 CFR part 541, such as full-time
teachers of an elementary or secondary school system, have not met the hours of
service requirement in order to claim that they are not entitled to FMLA leave. 
This is true even though the employer would not be required by the FLSA
regulations to keep records of the hours worked and even though the work may be
done outside the classroom.</p><p>29 CFR 825.110(c)(3)</p><p>(c)   Time for
military service</p><p>Pursuant to USERRA,
an employee returning from fulfilling a USERRA-covered military service
obligation is credited with the hours of service that would have been performed
but for the period of military service.  In order to determine the hours that
would have been worked (or, in the case of airline flight crew employees, would
have been paid) during the period of military service, the employee’s
pre-service work schedule can generally be used for calculations.</p><p>29 CFR 825.110(c)(2)</p>

worksite is ordinarily the site the employee reports to, or from which the
employee’s work is assigned.  A worksite can refer to a simple location, a
group of buildings, such as a campus or industrial park, or to separate
facilities in geographic proximity to one another.  The 75 miles are measured
from the employee’s worksite by surface miles using surface transportation over
public streets, roads, highways and waterways by the shortest route possible.  If

fixed worksite, such as in the case for many construction workers,
transportation workers, and salespersons, the site to which they report, from
which their work is assigned, or the location to which they are assigned as
their home base, is their worksite.  An employee’s personal residence is not a
worksite.  In the case of employees who work from home under “telework” or
“flexi place arrangements” or others such as salespersons who may leave to work
from home and return to their residence, their worksite is the office to which
they report or from which their assignments are made.  If 50 employees are
employed within 75 miles from the employee’s official worksite, the employee meets

the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; such leave must
be taken within 12 months of the placement.  Adoption means legally and
permanently assuming the responsibility of raising a child as one’s own.  Foster
care is 24-hour care for children in substitution for, and away from, their
parents or guardian. Such placements involve state action, voluntary or
involuntary removal of the child from the parents or guardian, and an agreement
between the state and foster family that the family will care for the child.

consultations with an attorney or doctor representing the child.</p><p>(c)   Leave
taken after the placement of a healthy child for adoption or foster care may be
taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only with the employer’s

with the child during the first 12 months following the placement, regardless
of blood or legal relationship.  For example, if one member of an unmarried

              <h3>39d03 - Leave to care for spouse,
son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition.</h3>
              <p>(a)   An
eligible employee is entitled to take up to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave in a
12-month period to care for a covered family member with a serious health
condition.  The employee must provide notice to the employer of the need for
leave and provide requested certifications pursuant to 29 CFR 825.305.</p><p>(b)   An
employee is entitled to take intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule to
care for a family member only when medically necessary.  This may include not
only a situation where the condition of the family member is intermittent but
also where the employee is only needed intermittently—such as where other care
is normally provided by others.</p><p>29 CFR 825.202(b)</p><p>(c)   The concept
of “needed to care for” a family member encompasses both physical or
psychological care, and may include one or more of the following:</p><p>(1)  Providing
psychological comfort and reassurance to a child, parent, or spouse receiving
inpatient or home care,</p><p>(2)  Providing basic
nutritional, medical, hygienic care of the family member who is unable to care
for these needs him or herself,</p><p>(3)  Providing
safety for the family member with a serious health condition who cannot safely
be left alone,</p><p>(4)  Providing
transportation to doctor appointments, therapy, or other treatments, and</p><p>(5)  Attending care
conferences during which the family member’s health care provider discusses the
family member’s condition, immediate needs, incidents, and general well being.</p><p>29 CFR 825.124</p><p>WHD Non-Administrator Letter FMLA-94 February
27, 1998</p><p>(d)   Definitions</p><p>(1)  Spouse</p><p>a.     Spouse
means a husband or wife as defined or recognized in the state where the individual
was married and includes individuals in a same-sex marriage or common law
marriage.</p><p>b.     Spouse
also includes a husband or wife in a marriage that was validly entered into
outside of the United States if the marriage could have been entered into in at
least one state.</p><p>29   SC
2611(13)</p><p>29 CFR 825.122(b)</p><p>(2)  Son or daughter</p><p>a.     The
FMLA defines a son or daughter as a biological, adopted, or foster child, a
stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis who
is under age 18; or 18 or older and incapable of self-care because of a
physical or mental disability at the time that FMLA leave is to commence.  It
does not matter if the onset of the disability occurs before or after the son
or daughter turns 18 for purposes of FMLA leave, provided that the disability
exists and renders the adult child incapable of self-care at the time the
employee’s leave is to commence.</p><p>29 USC 2611(12)</p><p>29 CFR 825.122(d)</p><p>WHD Administrator’s
Interpretation No. 2013-1</p><p>b.     Physical
or mental disability</p><p>Physical or mental
disability means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one
or more of the major life activities of an individual. Regulations at 29 CFR
1630.2 (h), (i) and (j), issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under
the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq., define these
terms.</p><p>The Americans with
Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) significantly broadened the
scope of the ADA’s definition of disability.  Because the FMLA’s definition of
an adult son or daughter relies on the ADA’s definition of disability, the
changes to the definition of disability set forth in the ADAAA and its implementing
regulations apply to the definition of a son or daughter 18 years of age or
older under the FMLA.  See WHD Administrator’s Interpretation No. 2013-1.</p><p>1.     “Substantially
limits” does not require that the impairment prevents, or severely or significantly
restricts, the individual in performing a major life activity.</p><p>2.     Major
life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing
manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting,
bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking,
communicating, interacting with others, and working.  Major life activities
also include the operation of major bodily functions, such as functions of the
immune system, normal cell growth, and digestive, brain, respiratory,
neurological and reproductive functions.</p><p>3.     The
use of mitigating measures to ameliorate the effects of an impairment may not
be considered when determining the limitations on a major life activity, except
for the use of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses.</p><p>4.     An
impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if the impairment
would substantially limit a major life activity when active.  Examples include,
but are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, asthma, epilepsy, diabetes, lupus,
post traumatic stress disorder and cancer in remission.</p><p>5.     There
is no minimum duration of time required for an impairment to be considered a
disability.</p><p>6.     The
term disability is to be construed in favor of broad coverage when determining
if an individual has a disability.</p><p>7.     The
EEOC’s regulations provide that some impairments will virtually always qualify
as disabilities because, by their very nature, they substantially limit at
least one major life activity.  Impairments that should easily be concluded to
be substantially limiting include deafness, blindness, intellectual disability,
missing limbs or mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair,
autism, cancer, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”) infection, muscular dystrophy, major depressive
disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive
compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia.</p><p>c.     Incapable
of self-care</p><p>Incapable of
self-care means that the individual requires active assistance or supervision
to provide daily self-care in three or more “activities of daily living” (ADLs)
or “instrumental activities of daily living” (IADLs) due to a disability.</p><p>1.     Activities
of daily living include adaptive activities such as caring appropriately for
one’s grooming and hygiene, bathing, dressing and eating.</p><p>2.     Instrumental
activities of daily living include cooking, cleaning, shopping, taking public transportation,
paying bills, maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, using
a post office, etc.</p><p>3.     These
lists of ADLs and IADLs are not exhaustive and additional activities should
also be considered in determining whether an adult son or daughter is incapable
of self-care due to a disability.</p><p>4.     The
determination of whether an adult son or daughter is incapable of self-care is
made based on the individual’s condition at the time the employee requests
leave.  The determination should include, for example, the current effects of
any episodic impairment.</p><p>d.     There
are special definitions of son and daughter applicable to military family leave
that are not limited by age.  See 29 CFR 825.122(h) and (i).</p><p>(3)  Parent</p><p>Parent means a biological, adoptive, step or
foster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco parentis to
the employee when the employee was a son or daughter (as defined by the FMLA). 
This term does not include parents-in-law.</p><p>29 USC 2611(7)</p><p>29 CFR 825.122(c)</p><p>There is a special definition of parent
applicable to military caregiver leave.  29 CFR 825.122(j).</p><p>(4)  In Loco
Parentis</p><p>In loco parentis means in the place of a
parent.  An employee who stands in loco parentis to a child is entitled to
leave for bonding purposes or if leave is needed to care for the child with a
serious health condition.  An eligible employee is also entitled to FMLA leave
to care for someone who stood in loco parentis to the employee when he or she was
a child.  Whether an in loco parentis relationship exists is dependent upon the
specific facts of the case.  Factors to be looked at in determining whether an in
loco parentis relationship exists include:</p><p>a.     The
age of the child,</p><p>b.     The
degree to which the child is dependent on the person claiming in loco parentis
status,</p><p>c.     The
amount of support, if any, provided, and</p><p>d.     The
extent to which duties commonly associated with parenthood are exercised.</p><p>A blood or legal relationship is irrelevant to
determining in loco parentis status.  For example, an employee who will share
equally in the raising of an adopted child with a same-sex partner, but who
does not have a legal relationship with the child, stands in loco parentis to
the child.  In addition, the fact that a child has a biological mother and
father does not prevent a finding that another individual stands in loco
parentis to the child.</p><p>WHD Administrator’s Interpretation No. 2010-3</p><p>(e)   Leave for
other family members</p><p>(1)  Generally, an
employee is not entitled to FMLA leave to care for other family members with
serious health conditions, such as siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, or
parents-in-law.</p><p>(2)  Exceptions may
arise where the employee can document the existence of an in loco parentis
relationship.  For example, an employee may take FMLA leave to care for an aunt
or uncle with a serious health condition if the aunt or uncle stood in loco
parentis to the employee when the employee was a child.  See FOH 39d09(b)(4)
for military caregiver “next of kin” definition.</p><p>WHD Administrator’s

eligible employee may take up to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave if he or she is
unable to perform the functions of his or her job because of a serious health
condition.  An employee is unable to perform the functions of his or her

suffers from a serious health condition that does not prevent him or her from
performing the essential functions of the position is not entitled to FMLA
leave.  Similarly, an employee who cannot perform one or more of the essential
functions of the position, but whose condition does not meet the statutory and

              <p>(a)   General</p><p>(1)  For FMLA
purposes:</p><p>a.     A
serious health condition means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or
mental condition that involves inpatient care or continuing treatment.</p><p>b.     “Incapacity”
means the inability to work, attend school, or perform other regular daily
activities due to a serious health condition or its treatment or recovery.</p><p>c.     “Treatment”
includes examinations to determine if a serious health condition exists,
evaluations of the condition, and actual treatment by or under the supervision
of a health care provider to resolve or alleviate the condition.  An
examination or treatment requires a visit to the health care provider to
qualify under FMLA; a telephone conversation is not sufficient.  Treatment does
not include routine physical, eye, or dental exams.</p><p>(2)  The FMLA is not
intended to cover short-term conditions for which treatment and recovery are
very brief.  Unless complications arise, the following conditions generally
will not meet the definition of an FMLA serious health condition:  the common
cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other than
migraine, routine dental or orthodontia problems, periodontal disease.  The
objective test defining what constitutes a serious health condition under the
FMLA is controlling.  Common ailments such as those listed above ordinarily
will not qualify for FMLA leave because they generally will not satisfy these
regulatory criteria.</p><p>73 FR 67934, 67946</p><p>(3)  Conditions for
which cosmetic treatments are administered, such as for acne or plastic
surgery, do not qualify unless inpatient hospital care is required or
complications develop that result in the condition meeting the definition of a
serious health condition.</p><p>29 USC 2611(11)</p><p>29 CFR 825.113</p><p>(b)   Inpatient

an overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility,
including any period of incapacity or any subsequent treatment in connection
with such inpatient care.</p><p>29 CFR 825.114</p><p>(c)   Continuing
treatment</p><p>A serious health
condition involving continuing treatment by a health care provider includes any
one of the following:</p><p>(1)  Incapacity and
treatment</p><p>a.     A
period of incapacity of more than 3 consecutive, full calendar days, and any
subsequent treatment or period of related incapacity that also involves:</p><p>1.     An
in-person treatment by a health care provider within seven days of the first
day of incapacity followed by at least one more in-person treatment within 30
days, unless extenuating circumstances exist; or</p><p>2.     An
in-person treatment by a health care provider within seven days of the first
day of incapacity which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the
supervision of the health care provider.</p><p>3.     Whether
additional treatment visits or a regimen of continuing treatment are necessary
within the 30-day period is to be determined by the health care provider.</p><p>b.     A
regimen of continuing treatment includes, for example, a course of prescription
medication or therapy requiring special equipment.  It does not include only
the taking of over-the-counter medications, bed-rest, or drinking fluids, exercise,
and other similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a health
care provider, even if these are recommended by the health care provider.</p><p>29 CFR 825.115(a)</p><p>WHD Opinion Letter

prenatal care</p><p>a.     Any
period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care.  Absences
occasioned by prenatal visits to a health care provider, severe morning
sickness, or other complications of pregnancy constitute serious health
conditions under the FMLA.</p><p>b.     Absences
attributable to incapacity for pregnancy or prenatal care qualify for FMLA
leave even though the employee or the covered family member does not receive
treatment from a health care provider during the absence and even if the
absence does not last more than three consecutive, full calendar days.  For
example, an employee who is pregnant may be unable to report to work because of
severe morning sickness.</p><p>29 CFR 825.115(b) and
(f), 825.120(a)</p><p>(3)  Chronic
conditions</p><p>a.     Any
period of incapacity or treatment due to a condition which requires at least
two visits per year for treatment by a health care provider, or a nurse under
direct supervisions of a health care provider, and that continues over an
extended period of time (including recurring episodes of the same underlying
condition).</p><p>b.     Examples
of chronic conditions that may meet the FMLA definition of a serious health
condition include but are not limited to asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, migraine
headaches, etc.</p><p>c.     Chronic
conditions frequently involve intermittent leave or leave on a reduced
schedule.  Absences attributable to incapacity for chronic conditions qualify
for FMLA leave even though the employee or the covered family member does not
receive treatment from a health care provider during the absence and even if
the absence does not last more than three consecutive, full calendar days.  For
example, an employee with asthma may be unable to report for work due to the
onset of an asthma attack or because the employee’s health care provider has
advised the employee to stay home when the pollen count exceeds a certain level.</p><p>29 CFR 825.115(c) and
(f)</p><p>(4)  Permanent or
long-term conditions</p><p>a.     A
period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition for
which treatment may not be effective.</p><p>b.     The
employee or family member must be under the continuing supervision of, but need
not be receiving active treatment by, a health care provider.</p><p>c.     Examples
of permanent or long-term conditions include but are not limited to
Alzheimer’s, a severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease.</p><p>29 CFR 825.115(d)</p><p>(5)  Conditions
requiring multiple treatments</p><p>a.     Any
period of absence to receive multiple treatments (or a period of recovery from
treatments) by a health care provider, or under the orders of a health care
provider, for:</p><p>1.     Restorative
surgery after an accident or other injury, or</p><p>2.     A
condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three
consecutive, full calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or
treatment.</p><p>b.     Examples
of such conditions may include but are not limited to chemotherapy or radiation
for cancer; physical therapy for severe arthritis; or dialysis for kidney
disease.</p><p>29 CFR 825.115(e)</p>

mental or physical disability.</p><p>The military member
must be the spouse, parent, son or daughter of the employee requesting leave.  No
relationship is required between the child of the military member on covered
active duty and the employee requesting leave.</p><p>29 CFR 825.126(b)(3)</p><p>(4)  Financial and
legal arrangements</p><p>a.     Leave
may be taken to make or update financial or legal arrangements necessary to
address the military member’s absence.</p><p>For example, preparing
and executing financial and healthcare powers of attorney, transferring bank
account signature authority, enrolling in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility
Reporting System (DEERS), obtaining military ID cards, or preparing or updating
a will or living trust.</p><p>b.     Leave
may also be taken to act as the military member’s representative before a
federal, state, or local agency for purposes of obtaining, arranging, or
appealing military service benefits while the military member is on covered
active duty and for a period of 90 days following the termination of covered
active duty status.</p><p>29 CFR 825.126(b)(4)</p><p>(5)  Counseling</p><p>Leave may be taken to attend counseling
provided by someone other than a health care provider (such as pastoral
counseling) for oneself, for the military member, or for a child of the
military member provided the need for counseling arises from the covered active
duty of the military member.  In addition, leave for counseling by a health
care provider may be FMLA-protected if the condition qualifies as a serious
health condition.  See FOH 39d03 and 39d04.</p><p>29 CFR 825.126(b)(5)</p><p>(6)  Rest and Recuperation</p><p>a.     Leave
may be taken to spend time with a military member who is on short-term,
temporary, Rest and Recuperation leave during the period of deployment.</p><p>b.     Leave
taken for this purpose may be taken for a period of up to 15 calendar days. 
Leave for this reason is available beginning on the first day of the military
member’s Rest and Recuperation leave and must be taken within the period of  time
specified in the military member’s Rest and Recuperation leave orders.</p><p>c.     The
employee may take this leave in a continuous block of time or intermittently
during the period of the military member’s Rest and Recuperation leave.</p><p>d.     An
employer may request a copy of the military member’s Rest and Recuperation
orders, or other documentation from the military indicating that the military
member has been granted Rest and Recuperation leave and the date of the Rest
and Recuperation leave, to determine the employee’s specific leave period for
this type of qualifying exigency leave.  See 29 CFR 825.309(b)(6).</p><p>29 CFR 825.126(b)(6)</p><p>(7)  Post-deployment
activities</p><p>a.     Events
and briefings</p><p>Leave may be taken to
attend arrival ceremonies, reintegration briefings and events, and any other
official ceremony or program sponsored by the military for a period of 90 days
following the termination of the military member’s covered active duty.</p><p>b.     Death
of the military member</p><p>Leave may be taken to
address issues that arise from the death of the military member while on
covered active duty.  Such leave may include meeting and recovering the body of
the military member, making funeral arrangements, and attending funeral
services.</p><p>29 CFR 825.126(b)(7)</p><p>(8)  Parental care</p><p>a.     Arranging
alternative care</p><p>Leave may be taken to
arrange for alternative care for a parent of the military member when the
parent is incapable of self-care and the covered active duty or call to covered
active duty of the military member necessitates a change in the existing care
arrangement.</p><p>b.     Providing
care</p><p>Leave may be taken to
provide care on an urgent, immediate need basis for a parent of a military
member when the parent is incapable of self-care and the need to provide such
care arises out of the military member’s covered active duty.  FMLA leave is
not available for routine, regular, or everyday care of the military member’s
parent.</p><p>c.     Admitting
or transferring to a care facility</p><p>Leave may be taken to
admit or transfer a parent of the military member to a care facility when the
parent is incapable of self-care and the admittance or transfer is necessitated
by the covered active duty of the military member.</p><p>d.     Attending
meetings</p><p>Leave may be taken to
attend meetings with staff at a care facility for a parent of the military
member, such as meetings with hospice or social service providers, when the
parent is incapable of self-care and such meetings are necessitated by the
covered active duty of the military member.  FMLA leave is not available for
routine or regular meetings.</p><p>e.     Parent
of the military member</p><p>For purposes of
parental care leave, a parent of the military member means a biological,
adoptive, step or foster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in
loco parentis to the military member when the member was under 18 years of age.</p><p>The military member
must be the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of the employee requesting leave. 
No relationship is required between the parent of the military member on
covered active duty and the employee requesting leave.</p><p>f.      Incapable
of self-care</p><p>For purposes of leave
for parental care, the parent of the military member must be incapable of
self-care.</p><p>1.     A
parent who is incapable of self-care means that the parent requires active
assistance or supervision to provide daily self-care in three or more of the
activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living.</p><p>2.     Activities
of daily living include, but are not limited to, adaptive activities such as
caring appropriately for one’s grooming and hygiene, bathing, dressing, and
eating. Instrumental activities of daily living include, but are not limited
to, cooking, cleaning, shopping, taking public transportation, paying bills,
maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, using a post office,
etc.</p><p>29 CFR 825.126(b)(8)</p><p>(9)  Additional
activities</p><p>Leave may be taken to address events other than
those listed above which arise out of the military member’s covered active duty
provided that the employee and employer agree the leave will qualify as an exigency
and agree to the timing and duration of such leave.</p><p>29 CFR 825.126(b)(9)</p>

              <h3>39d09 - Military caregiver leave.</h3>
              <p>(a)   General</p><p>(1)  Eligible
employees who are the spouse, parent, son, daughter, or next of kin of a
covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness are entitled to up to 26
workweeks of FMLA leave in a “single 12-month period” to care for that covered
servicemember.  Covered servicemembers include current members of the Regular
or Reserve components of the Armed Forces and certain veterans.</p><p>29 USC 2611(15), 2612(a)(3)</p><p>Employers were not required to provide military
caregiver leave for the care of a veteran until the Department defined a
qualifying serious injury or illness of a veteran through regulations and those
regulations became effective.  Regulations defining a qualifying serious injury
or illness of a veteran became effective on March 8, 2013.</p><p>78 FR 8848</p><p>78 FR 8834</p><p>A covered servicemember means:</p><p>a.     Current
servicemember</p><p>A current member of
the Armed Forces of the United States, including a member of the National Guard
or Reserves, who has a serious injury or illness for which he or she is
undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is in outpatient
status, or is on the temporary disability retired list for a serious injury or
illness.</p><p>29 USC 2611(15)(A)</p><p>29 CFR 825.127(b)(1)<a name="OLE_LINK5"></a><a name="OLE_LINK4"></a></p><p>b.     Veteran</p><p>A veteran who is
undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a serious injury or
illness and who was a member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the
National Guard or Reserves, and was discharged or released under conditions
other than dishonorable at any time during the period of five years preceding
the date on which the employee first takes leave to care for the veteran (the
five-year period).</p><p>1.     Veteran
discharged on or after March 8, 2013</p><p>For a veteran
discharged on or after March 8, 2013, the five-year period for FMLA military
caregiver leave begins on the date of discharge.</p><p>2.     Veteran
discharged between October 28, 2009 and March 8, 2013</p><p>For a veteran
discharged between October 28, 2009 and March 8, 2013, the five-year period for
FMLA military caregiver leave begins on [effective date of Final Rule].</p><p>3.     Veteran
discharged before October 28, 2009</p><p>For a veteran
discharged before October 28, 2009 , the period between October 28, 2009 and March
8, 2013 does not count toward the determination of the five-year period for
covered veteran status.</p><p>In this case, the
veteran will have the same amount of time available on March 8, 2013 as he or
she would have had on October 28, 2009.</p><p>A.    For
example, if a servicemember retired on October 28, 2007, he or she would have had
three years remaining of the five-year period on October 28, 2009.  Therefore,
the family member requesting FMLA leave will have three years to begin military
caregiver leave starting on March 8, 2013.</p><p>B.    However,
if a servicemember was discharged on December 1, 2003, the discharge would have
occurred more than five years prior to October 28, 2009 and the veteran would
not be a covered veteran for military caregiver leave purposes.</p><p>29 USC 2611(15)(B)</p><p>29 CFR 825.127(b)(2)</p><p>(2)  A serious
injury or illness for a covered servicemember is:</p><p>a.     Current
servicemember’s serious injury or illness</p><p>1.     An
injury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that may render
the servicemember medically unfit to perform the duties of his or her office,
grade, rank, or rating, or</p><p>2.     An
injury or illness that existed before the beginning of the servicemember’s
active duty and was aggravated by service in line of duty on active duty in the
Armed Forces that may render the member medically unfit to perform the duties
of his or her office, grade, rank, or rating.</p><p>29 USC 2611(18)(A)</p><p>29 CFR 825.127(c)(1)</p><p>b.     Veteran’s
serious injury or illness</p><p>1.     An
injury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that that
manifested itself before or after the servicemember became a veteran and that
is:</p><p>A.    A
continuation of a serious injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated
when the veteran was a member of the Armed Forces and rendered the
servicemember unable to perform the duties of the servicemember’s office,
grade, rank, or rating, or</p><p>B.    A
physical or mental condition for which the veteran has received a U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs Service-Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50
percent or greater, and the VASRD rating is based, in whole or in part, on the
condition precipitating the need for military caregiver leave, or</p><p>C.    A
physical or mental condition that substantially impairs the veteran’s ability
to work because of a disability or disabilities related to military service, or
would do so absent treatment, or</p><p>D.    An
injury that is the basis for the veteran’s enrollment in the Department of
Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers.</p><p>2.     An
injury or illness that existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty
and was aggravated by service in line of duty on active duty in the Armed
Forces that otherwise meets any of the definitions in A – D above.</p><p>29 USC 2611(18)(B)</p><p>29 CFR 825.127(c)(2)</p><p>(3)  26 workweeks of
leave in a 12-month period</p><p>a.     The
single 12-month period for military caregiver leave begins on the first day the
employee takes FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember and ends 12
months after that date, regardless of the method used by the employer to
determine the employee’s 12 workweeks of leave entitlement for other
FMLA-qualifying reasons.</p><p>For example, if an
employee first takes military caregiver leave beginning June 1, 2013, the
employee’s single 12-month period for military caregiver leave is June 1, 2013
through May 31, 2014, regardless of the fact that the employer may use the
calendar year for tracking FMLA leave usage.</p><p>If an employee does
not take all of his or her 26 workweeks to care for a covered servicemember
during this single 12-month period, the remaining leave is forfeited.</p><p>b.     The
single 12-month period is applied on a per-covered servicemember, per-injury
basis.  Therefore, an eligible employee may take more than one period of 26
workweeks of leave if the leave is to care for a different covered
servicemember or to care for the same servicemember with a subsequent
(different) serious injury or illness.  However, no more than 26 workweeks of
leave may be taken within any single 12-month period.</p><p>1.     A
subsequent serious injury or illness of the same covered servicemember could
arise either from a different injury or illness incurred by the current sevicemember
during a subsequent deployment or from a different injury or illness that relates
back to the initial incident but that manifests at a later time.</p><p>A.    For
example, an eligible employee may take leave in one 12-month period to care for
a servicemember who incurs a traumatic brain injury and take leave in a
subsequent 12-month period to care for the same servicemember who returns to
duty and is injured by an incendiary explosive device.</p><p>B.    Additionally,
if a current covered servicemember suffers severe burns in the line of duty, an
eligible employee is entitled to 26 workweeks of military caregiver leave.  If
the servicemember later manifests post traumatic stress disorder that was
incurred in the same incident as the burns, the eligible employee would be
entitled to an additional 26 workweeks of leave to care for the same
servicemember.</p><p>2.     A
“current” covered servicemember and a “veteran” covered servicemember will be
considered different covered servicemembers for purposes of the 26 workweeks in
a single 12-month period requirement.  Therefore, an eligible employee could
take military caregiver leave to care for a current servicemember who suffered
a burn injury while in active duty service and later take leave to care for the
same servicemember for the same injury when the servicemember becomes a veteran. 
All normal eligibility requirements would apply when the employee seeks
military caregiver leave to care for the veteran.</p><p>29 CFR 825.127(e),
825.200(b)</p><p>77 FR 8960, 8970</p><p>73 FR 67934, 67969</p><p>78 FR 8834</p><p>78 FR 8854</p><p>c.     During
the single 12-month period the employee can take a combined total of 26
workweeks of leave, no more than 12 weeks of which can be for any combination
of FMLA-qualifying reasons other than military caregiver leave (i.e., leave for
the birth or placement of a child, leave due to the serious health condition of
the employee or the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent, or leave due
to a qualifying exigency arising from a military member’s covered active duty
status).  However, the employee’s entitlement to FMLA leave for reasons other
than military caregiver leave is limited by his or her prior use of FMLA leave
during the applicable 12-month period.</p><p>1.     For
example, where an employee first takes military caregiver leave beginning June
1, 2013 and works for an employer who uses the calendar year for tracking FMLA
leave usage, the employee’s single 12-month period for military caregiver leave
is June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014.  If the employee had used five weeks of
FMLA leave between January 1 and June 1, 2013 for a qualifying reason other
than military caregiver leave, such as for his own serious health condition, he
would only have seven weeks of FMLA leave for a qualifying reason other than
military caregiver leave available through December 31, 2013.  Once the
employee exhausts his 26-workweek entitlement, he may not take any FMLA leave
for any reason until the single 12-month period ends.</p><p>2.     Thus,
if the employee used 20 weeks of military caregiver leave from June-December,
2013, four weeks of leave in January, 2014 for his own serious health
condition, and another two weeks of military caregiver leave in March, 2014,
the employee will have exhausted his 26-workeek entitlement for the single
12-month period (June 1, 2013-May 31, 2014).  The employee would still have
eight weeks of FMLA leave for a qualifying reason other than military caregiver
leave available in calendar year 2014; however, he could not take this leave
until after the single 12-month period ends on May 31, 2014.</p><p>29 CFR 825.127(e)</p><p>73 FR 67934,
67970-67971</p><p>(4)  Qualifying
leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition</p><p>Leave that qualifies as both leave to care for
a covered servicemember and leave to care for a family member with a serious
health condition during the single 12-month period must be designated by the
employer as leave to care for a covered servicemember.  It cannot be designated
and counted as leave for both reasons.</p><p>28 CFR 825.127(e)(3)</p><p>(5)  Spouses working
for the same employer</p><p>Spouses employed by the same employer are
limited to a combined total of 26 workweeks of leave during the single 12-month
period if the leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember with a serious
injury or illness or for a combination of military caregiver leave and leave
for the birth of the employee’s son or daughter, placement of a son or daughter
with the employee for adoption of foster care, or to care for the employee’s
parent with a serious health condition.  See FOH 39e03.</p><p>29 CFR 825.127(f)</p><p>(b)   Definitions</p><p>(1)  Outpatient
status</p><p>The status of a member of the Armed Forces
assigned to either a military medical treatment facility as an outpatient or a
unit established for the purpose of providing command and control of members of
the Armed Forces receiving medical care as outpatients.</p><p>29 USC 2611(16)</p><p>29 CFR 825.127(b)(1)</p><p>(2)  Son or daughter
of a covered servicemember</p><p>The covered servicemember’s biological,
adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child for whom the
covered servicemember stood in loco parentis, and who is of any age.</p><p>29 CFR 825.127(d)(1)</p><p>(3)  Parent of a
covered servicemember</p><p>A covered servicemember’s biological, adoptive,
step, or foster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco
parentis to the covered servicemember.  This does not include parents “in law.”</p><p>29 CFR 825.127(d)(2)</p><p>(4)  Next of kin of
a covered servicemember</p><p>The covered servicemember’s next of kin is the
servicemember’s nearest blood relative.  The next of kin is someone other than
the servicemember’s spouse, parent, son or daughter, and is determined in the
following order of priority:</p><p>a.     Designated
next of kin for purposes of military caregiver leave under the FMLA</p><p>The covered
servicemember may specifically designate in writing his or her nearest blood
relative for purposes of military caregiver leave under the FMLA.  When such
designation has been made, the designated individual is deemed the covered
servicemember’s only next of kin.  The designated next of kin must be a blood
relative of the covered servicemember.</p><p>b.     Order
of priority</p><p>When a servicemember
does not make a designation for purposes of FMLA leave, the next of kin is determined
in the following order of priority:</p><p>1.     Blood
relatives who have been granted legal custody of the servicemember by court
decree or statutory provisions,</p><p>2.     Brothers
and sisters,</p><p>3.     Grandparents,</p><p>4.     Aunts
and uncles,</p><p>5.     First
cousins.</p><p>When there are
multiple family members with the same level of relationship and the covered
servicemember has not designated a next of kin for FMLA purposes, all such
family members are considered the next of kin and all may take leave to provide
care to the covered servicemember, either consecutively or simultaneously.</p><p>For example, if a
covered servicemember has three siblings and has not designated a blood
relative to provide care for FMLA purposes, all three siblings would be
considered the covered servicemember’s next of kin.  Alternatively, where a
covered servicemember has one or more siblings and designates a cousin as his
or her next of kin for FMLA purposes, then only the designated cousin is
eligible as the covered servicemember’s next of kin.</p><p>29 USC 2611(17)</p><p>29 CFR 825.127(d)(3)</p>

              <h3>39e00 - FMLA leave entitlement.</h3>
              <p>(a)   General</p><p>An eligible employee
is entitled to up to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave per 12-month period for FMLA-qualifying
reasons other than military caregiver leave (see FOH 39d09).  Multiple
serious health conditions or qualifying reasons for leave do not increase the FMLA
leave entitlement.  However, an employee is entitled to up to 12 workweeks of leave
for any one or for multiple qualifying reasons in the same leave year and additional
leave for the same qualifying reason, including the same serious health condition,
in subsequent leave years.</p><p>See FOH 39d09(a)(3)
for the single 12-month period applicable to military caregiver leave.</p><p>(b)   12-month
FMLA leave year for qualifying leave reasons other than military caregiver
leave.</p><p>(1)  The employer
may select any one of the following methods for determining the 12-month period
during which the 12 workweeks of leave entitlement occur:</p><p>a.     The
calendar year</p><p>b.     Any
fixed 12-month leave year, such as a fiscal year.</p><p>c.     A
12-month period measured forward from the first date of FMLA leave for the
employee.  The next 12-month period would begin the first time FMLA leave is
taken after completion of the prior 12-month period.</p><p>d.     A
rolling 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses FMLA
leave.  Under this method, each time an employee takes FMLA leave the remaining
leave would be the balance of the 12 weeks which has not been used during the
immediately preceding 12 months.</p><p>1.     Example
1:</p><p>Employee A used eight
weeks of FMLA leave during the past 12 months, employee A has an additional
four weeks of FMLA leave available.</p><p>Example 2:</p><p>Employee B used four
weeks of FMLA beginning February 1, 2011, four weeks beginning June 1, 2011,
and four weeks beginning December 1, 2011.  Employee B may not take any
additional leave FMLA leave until February 1, 2012.  Beginning on February 1,
2012, employee B is entitled to use one additional day of FMLA leave each day
for four weeks. Employee B also begins to regain additional days of FMLA leave
beginning on June 1, 2012, and additional days beginning on December 1, 2012.</p><p>(2)  Employers may
choose any method as long as it is applied uniformly and consistently to all
employees.  An exception to this uniformity applies in the case of a multi-state
employer who must comply with a state requirement for determination of the leave
year. In this case the employer may comply with the state requirement for
employees in that state and uniformly choose another method for all its other
employees.</p><p>(3)  An employer may
change to another leave year determination only after providing 60 days notice
to all employees.  During the 60-day transition, employees retain full benefit
of their 12 workweeks of leave under whichever method provides the greatest
benefit.</p><p>(4)  If an employer
fails to select one of these methods for setting the 12-month period, the
employer must use the 12-month period calculation method that is most
beneficial to the employee.</p><p>29 CFR 825.200</p>

              <h3>39e01 - Intermittent leave.</h3>
              <p>(a)   General</p><p>(1)  FMLA leave may
be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule under the following
conditions:</p><p>a.     When
there is a medical need for leave that can be best accommodated through an
intermittent or reduced leave schedule for an employee’s own serious health
condition, to care for a spouse, parent, son, or daughter with a serious health
condition, or to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or
illness.  Such leave may be necessary for planned and/or unanticipated medical
treatment of a serious health condition or of a serious injury or illness of a covered
servicemember, or during recovery from treatment.  It may also be taken to
provide care or psychological comfort to a spouse, parent, son, or daughter
with a serious health condition or a covered servicemember with a serious
injury or illness.  Examples of medically necessary intermittent leave include:</p><p>1.     Leave
taken for a condition which requires treatment by a health care provider
periodically, rather than for one continuous period of time, and may include
leave of periods from an hour or more to several weeks,</p><p>2.     Leave
taken by a pregnant employee for prenatal examinations or for periods of severe
morning sickness,</p><p>3.     Leave
taken for absences where a family member is incapacitated or the employee is unable
to perform the essential functions of the position intermittently because of a
chronic serious health condition, even if he or she does not receive treatment
from a health care provider.</p><p>b.     When
leave is taken due to a qualifying exigency.</p><p>(2)  Intermittent
leave or a reduced leave schedule after the birth of a healthy child or
placement of a healthy child for adoption or foster care may only be taken if
the employer agrees.</p><p>29 USC 2612(b)(1)</p><p>29 CFR 825.202</p><p>(b)   Scheduling
of leave</p><p>If an employee needs
leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule for planned medical
treatment, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment
so as not to disrupt unduly the employer’s operations.</p><p>29 USC 2612(e)(2)</p><p>29 CFR 825.203</p><p>(c)   Transfer to
an alternate position</p><p>(1)  If an employee
needs intermittent leave that is foreseeable based on planned medical
treatment, the employer may require the employee to transfer temporarily,
during the period that the intermittent or reduced leave schedule is required,
to an alternative position for which the employee is qualified and that better
accommodates recurring periods of leave.</p><p>(2)  An employer
must provide equivalent pay and benefits in the alternative position, but the
position does not have to have equivalent duties.  The employer may increase
the pay and benefits of an existing alternative position to make them
equivalent to those of the employee’s regular job.  Where an employer’s normal
practice bases benefits on the number of hours worked, the employer may
proportionately reduce benefits for an employee’s reduced hours worked.</p><p>(3)  An employer may
not transfer an employee to an alternative position in order to discourage the
employee from taking leave or otherwise work a hardship on the employee.  See
FOH 39o.</p><p>(4)  When an
employee no longer needs to continue on intermittent or reduced schedule leave
and is able to return to full-time work, the employer must place the employee
in the same or equivalent job as the job the employee left when the leave
commenced.  The employee may not be required to take more leave than necessary
to address the circumstance that precipitated the need for leave.</p><p>(5)  The FMLA limits
an employer’s ability to require that an employee transfer to an alternate
position to situations involving foreseeable leave for planned medical
treatment.  This is the only situation where an employer may require a
transfer.</p><p>73 FR 67934, 67974-67975</p><p>29 USC 2612(b)(2)</p><p>29 CFR 825.204</p><p>(d)   Increments
of leave</p><p>(1)  The employer
must account for intermittent leave or reduced schedule leave by no greater
than the shortest period of time used to account for other forms of leave,
provided it is not greater than one hour and does not reduce the employee’s
FMLA entitlement by more than the amount of leave actually taken.  For example,
if an employer accounts for the use of annual leave in increments of one hour
and the use of sick leave in increments of one-half hour, then FMLA leave use
must be accounted for using increments no larger than one-half hour.   If the
employer accounts for other forms of leave use in increments greater than one
hour during the period the FMLA leave is taken, the employer must account for
FMLA leave in increments no greater than one hour.   See FOH 39m02 for special
rules applicable to airline flight crew employees.</p><p>(2)  If an employer
uses varying increments to account for leave usage at different times of the
day or shift, the employer may not account for FMLA leave in a larger increment
than the shortest period used to account for other leave during the period the
FMLA leave is taken.  For example, if an employer usually accounts for all
types of leave in increments of 15 minutes, but accounts for all non-FMLA leave
for the first hour of the day in 30-minute increments, the employer may also
account for FMLA leave in an increment no greater than 30 minutes only during
the first hour of the day.</p><p>(3)  Where it is
physically impossible for an employee using intermittent leave or working a
reduced leave schedule to commence or end work mid-way through a shift, the
entire period that the employee is forced to be absent is designated as FMLA
leave and counts against the employee’s entitlement.  The “physical
impossibility” provision is intended to be narrowly construed and applied only
in instances of true physical impossibility.  Thus, if the exception applies to
a flight attendant, train conductor, ferry operator, bus driver, or truck
driver whose worksite is on board an airplane, train, boat, bus, or truck, or
to a laboratory technician whose workplace is inside a clean room that must
remain sealed for a certain period of time, the exception will only apply until
the vehicle has returned to the departure site or while the clean room remains
sealed.</p><p>29 CFR 825.205(a)</p><p>78 FR 8868</p><p>73 FR 67934, 67976 - 67978</p><p>(e)   Calculation
of leave</p><p>(1)  The employee’s
actual workweek is the basis for the FMLA entitlement.</p><p>a.     If
an employee is normally required to work more than 40 hours per week, the hours
worked beyond 40 must be included in determining the employee’s leave entitlement. 
For example, if an employee normally works overtime in three of every four
weeks, then such overtime hours are part of the usual and normal workweek
schedule of the employee and are included in calculating the FMLA entitlement
available to the employee.</p><p>b.     If
overtime hours are not required, or are voluntary, such hours are not counted
to calculate the employee’s FMLA entitlement and are not counted against the
employee’s FMLA entitlement when not worked.</p><p>73 FR 67934,
67978-67979</p><p>(2)  The FMLA provides
eligible employees with up to 12 workweeks of leave for qualifying reasons and
up to 26 workweeks of leave for military caregiver leave.  When an employee
takes leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule in periods of less
than one full week, only the amount of leave actually taken may be counted
toward the employee’s leave entitlement.  An employer may convert fractions of
a workweek to their hourly equivalent so long as the conversion equitably
reflects the employee’s total hours.  For example, an employee whose actual
workweek is always 40 hours per week, is entitled to an hourly equivalent of
480 hours (12 workweeks × 40 hours per week).  For an employee whose schedule
varies from week to week, the hourly equivalent must equitably reflect the
actual hours that would be worked during each workweek that FMLA leave is
needed.</p><p>(3)  If the
employee’s schedule varies from week to week to such an extent that the
employer is unable to determine how many hours the employee would have worked
had he or she not taken FMLA leave, the employer may use a weekly average of
the hours scheduled over the 12 months prior to the period of leave for
calculating the employee’s leave entitlement.</p><p>29 CFR 825.205(b) and (c)</p>

paid leave.</h3>
              <p>(a)   General</p><p>An eligible employee
may choose, or the employer may require the employee, to substitute accrued
paid leave for FMLA leave.  Substitute means that the paid leave provided by
the employer will run concurrently with the unpaid FMLA leave.</p><p>(b)   Accrued
paid leave</p><p>For the purpose of
substituting accrued paid leave, the employee must have both earned the leave
and be able to use that leave during the FMLA leave period.  The employer may
not require the employee to substitute leave that is not yet available to the
employee to use under the terms of the employer's leave plan.</p><p>This, however, would
neither prevent an employer from voluntarily advancing paid leave to an
employee nor an employee from voluntarily accepting such leave during an FMLA
absence.</p><p>WHD Non-Administrator
Letter FMLA-81 June 18, 1996</p><p>WHD Non-Administrator
Letter FMLA-61 May 12, 1995</p><p>(c)   Adherence
to employer’s leave policy</p><p>When accrued paid
leave is substituted, the employee receives pay pursuant to the employer’s
applicable paid leave policy during the otherwise unpaid FMLA leave.  An
employee’s ability to substitute accrued paid leave is determined by the terms
and conditions of the employer’s normal leave policy.  For example, pursuant to
an employer’s uniform policy for all employees, an employer may request a
doctor’s note in order for the employee to receive paid sick leave.  The
employer must inform the employee that he or she must satisfy any procedural
requirements of the paid leave policy to receive payment for the substituted
leave.  If the employee does not comply with the additional requirements of the
employer’s paid leave policy, the employee is no longer entitled to substitute
accrued paid leave, but remains entitled to take unpaid FMLA leave.</p><p>(d)   Concurrent
use of FMLA and other paid leaves</p><p>(1)  Leave taken
pursuant to a disability leave plan, which also meets the definition of a
serious health condition under the FMLA, may be counted against the employee’s
FMLA leave entitlement.  A serious health condition may result from an injury on
or off the job and leave for an injury meeting the FMLA criteria may be
designated by the employer as FMLA leave.</p><p>(2)  Because leave
under a disability benefit plan or workers’ compensation program is not unpaid,
the provision for substitution of accrued paid leave does not apply, and
neither the employee nor the employer may require the substitution of paid
leave.  However, employers and employees may agree, where state law permits, to
have accrued paid leave supplement the paid plan benefits, such as in a case
where a plan only provides two-thirds of an employee’s salary.</p><p>(3)  Section 7(o) of
the FLSA permits public employers, under certain conditions, to substitute
compensatory time off at one and one-half hours for each overtime hour worked
in lieu of paying cash to employees who work overtime.  If an employee requests
and is permitted to use accrued compensatory time concurrently with FMLA leave,
or the employer requires its use, the time may be counted against the
employee’s FMLA entitlement.</p><p>29 USC 2612(d)</p><p>29 C.F.R. 825.207</p><p>73 FR 67934, 67979-67983</p>

leave is to be continuous or intermittent, notice need only be given one time,
but the employee must advise the employer as soon as practicable if the dates
of scheduled leave change or are extended, or were initially unknown.</p><p>(4)  If the need for
leave was foreseeable based on an expected birth or placement for adoption or
foster care, for planned medical treatment of a serious health condition of the

practicable, regardless of how far in advance such leave is foreseeable.</p><p>29 USC 2612(e)</p><p>29 CFR 825.302(a)</p><p>(b)   Content
of notice</p><p>An employee must
provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the employer aware that the
employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave and the anticipated timing and duration of
the leave.  In all cases the employer is expected to inquire further if it is
necessary to obtain more information about whether the employee is seeking
FMLA-protected leave.  When the employee has taken leave previously for more
than one FMLA-qualifying reason, the employer may need to ask additional
questions to determine for which qualifying reason the employee is seeking FMLA
leave.</p><p>29 CFR 825.302(c)</p><p>(c)   Complying
with employer policies</p><p>The employer may
require the employee to comply with the employer’s usual and customary notice
and procedural requirements for requesting leave absent unusual circumstances. 
If the employee does not comply with the employer’s usual and customary policy
and procedures and no unusual circumstances exist, the FMLA-protected leave may
be delayed or denied.  However, if the employer’s policy requires notice to be
provided sooner than required under the FMLA and the employee does not comply
with the employer’s policy, FMLA-protected leave may not be delayed or denied.</p><p>29 CFR 825.302(d)</p><p>(d)   Scheduling
planned medical treatment</p><p>The employee must
make a reasonable effort to schedule planned medical treatment so as not to
unduly disrupt the employer’s operations.  An employee should consult with his

unpaid FMLA leave, the employer must inform the employee of this designation at
the time of designating the FMLA leave.  If the employer will require a
fitness-for-duty certification for restoration to employment, notice of this
requirement must be provided with the designation notice.</p><p>(2)  The employer

counted against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement in the designation
notice.</p><p>b.     If
it is not possible to provide the exact time that will be counted, such may be
the case with unforeseeable intermittent leave, then upon request by the
employee, the employer must provide notice of the amount of leave counted
against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement, but no more often than once in a
30-day period and only if leave is taken in that period.  This notice may be
oral or in writing, but if given orally, must be confirmed in writing no later
than the next payday, and can be in any form, including a note on the
employee’s pay stub.</p><p>(3)  Only one notice
of designation is required for each FMLA-qualifying reason per applicable
12-month period.  The employer may use the optional form WH-382.  If the leave
is not designated as FMLA because it does not meet the requirements, the notice
to the employee that the leave is not designated as FMLA leave may be a simple
written statement.</p><p>(4)  If the

notice of the change within five business days of receiving the employee’s first
notice of need for leave after the change.</p><p>29 CFR 825.300(d)</p>

              <p>(a)   The
employer is responsible in all circumstances for designating leave as
FMLA-qualifying once the employer has knowledge that the leave is being taken
for an FMLA-qualifying reason.  In any circumstance where the employer does not
have sufficient information about the employee’s reason for leave, the employer
should inquire further of the employee to determine whether leave is
potentially FMLA-qualifying.  The employer’s determination on whether leave is
FMLA-qualifying must be based only on information received from the employee or
the employee’s spokesperson.  Once the employer has acquired knowledge that the
leave is being taken for a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employer must notify the
employee.  See FOH 39g00(d).</p><p>(b)   Retroactive
designation</p><p>If the employer fails
to designate leave timely (i.e., within five business days absent unusual
circumstances), the employer may retroactively designate leave as FMLA leave
with appropriate notice to the employee provided that the employer’s failure to
timely designate leave does not cause harm or injury to the employee.  In all
cases where leave would qualify for FMLA protections, an employer and an
employee can mutually agree that leave be retroactively designated as FMLA
leave.</p><p>(c)   Disputes</p><p>If there is a dispute
between an employer and an employee as to whether leave qualifies as FMLA
leave, it should be resolved through discussions between the employee and the
employer.  Such discussions and the decision must be documented.</p><p>29 CFR 825.301</p>

              <h3>39h00 - General.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Valid
reasons for requesting certification</p><p>(1)  Employers may
require employees seeking leave to care for a covered family member with a
serious health condition or for their own serious health condition to support
the request with a certification issued by the health care provider of the
family member or the employee, respectively, and subsequent recertification, as
appropriate.  In certain circumstances, an employer may also require a
fitness-for-duty certification for restoration to employment when the leave is
for the employee’s own serious health condition.  See FOH 39h01 for medical
certification for a serious health condition and 39h02 for fitness for duty
certification.</p><p>(2)  An employer may
also require that an employee’s leave due to a qualifying exigency or to care
for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness be supported by a
certification.</p><p>See FOH 39h06 and 39h07 for certification
requirements for military family leave.</p><p>(3)  An employer may
not request certification of leave to care for a healthy newborn child, or for
placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care,
although the employer may request documentation of the family relationship.</p><p>See FOH 39h05.</p><p>(b)   Notice to
employee of certification requirement</p><p>(1)  An employer
must give notice to the employee each time a certification is required. When
required for the rights and responsibilities notice, the notification must be
written. Requests for subsequent certification may be oral.  When requesting a
certification, the employer must advise an employee of the consequences of an
employee’s failure to provide adequate certification.</p><p>(2)  In most cases,
the employer should request that an employee furnish certification at the time
the employee gives notice of the need for leave or within five business days. 
The employer may request certification at some later date if the employer later
has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration.</p><p>(c)   Employee
certification responsibilities</p><p>(1)  The employee
must provide the requested certification to the employer within 15 calendar
days after the employer’s request, unless it is not practicable under the
particular circumstances to do so despite the employee’s diligent, good faith
efforts, or the employer provides more than 15 calendar days to return the
requested certification.</p><p>(2)  The employee
must provide the employer with a complete and sufficient certification.  It is
the employee’s responsibility to furnish a complete and sufficient
certification or to furnish the health care provider providing the
certification with any necessary authorization from the employee or family
member in order for the health care provider to release a complete and
sufficient certification to the employer to support the employee’s FMLA
request.</p><p>(d)   Deficient
certification and opportunity to cure</p><p>(1)  The employer
must advise an employee whenever the employer finds any certification,
including medical certification of a serious health condition or serious injury
or illness of covered servicemember or certification of a qualifying exigency,
incomplete or insufficient, and must state in writing what additional
information is necessary to make the certification complete and sufficient. 
The employer must provide the employee with seven calendar days to correct any
deficiency, unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances for
the employee to cure any identified deficiency in the seven-day period despite
the employee’s diligent good faith efforts.  If the deficiencies specified by
the employer are not cured in the resubmitted certification, the employer may
deny the taking of FMLA leave.</p><p>(2)  A certification
is considered incomplete if one or more applicable entries have not been
completed.  A certification is considered insufficient if the information
provided is vague, ambiguous, or non-responsive.</p><p>(e)   Consequences
of employee’s failure to provide certification</p><p>It is the employer’s
responsibility to advise the employee of the consequences of failure to provide
adequate certification.  When an employee is unable to meet the 15-calendar day
deadline to submit a certification despite the employee’s diligent good faith
efforts, the employee is entitled to additional time to provide the
certification.  Employees are expected to communicate to their employers the
efforts they are making to secure the completed certification.</p><p>If the employee fails
to provide the employer with a timely complete and sufficient certification,
absent extenuating circumstances, or fails to provide any certification, the
employer may delay or deny the taking of FMLA leave.  See FOH 39h03.</p><p>29 CFR 825.313</p><p>73 FR 67934, 68036</p><p>29 USC 2613</p><p>29 CFR 825.305</p>

              <h3>39h01 - Medical certification of a
serious health condition.</h3>
              <p>When leave is taken
because of an employee’s own serious health condition or the serious health
condition of a family member, an employer may require the employee to obtain a
medical certification at the employee’s expense.  See FOH 39h06 for
certification of qualifying exigency leave and 39h07 for certification of
military caregiver leave.</p><p>(a)   Sufficient
medical certification</p><p>(1)  The FMLA
provides that a medical certification is sufficient if it states:</p><p>a.     The
date the serious health condition commenced and probable duration of the
condition;</p><p>b.     The
contact information of the health care provider and type of
practice/specialization;</p><p>c.     The
appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider
regarding the condition sufficient to support the need for leave;</p><p>d.     For
leave to care for a family member, a statement that the employee is needed to
care for the family member and an estimate of the amount of time needed; or for
leave for the employee’s own serious health condition, a statement that the
employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the position and the
likely duration of such inability; and</p><p>e.     For
intermittent or reduced schedule leave, the certification must also include:</p><p>1.     For
planned medical treatment of the employee’s or the employee’s family member’s
serious health condition, a statement of the medical necessity for intermittent
or reduced leave schedule and the dates treatment is expected and duration of
such treatment,</p><p>2.     For
unforeseeable leave for the employee’s own serious health condition (including
pregnancy) that causes unforeseen periods of incapacity, a statement of the
medical necessity for intermittent or reduced leave schedule and an estimation
of the frequency and duration of such periods of incapacity, and,</p><p>3.     For
unforeseeable leave for a family member’s serious health condition, a statement
that the leave schedule is medically necessary for the care of the family
member, which can include assisting in the family member’s recovery, and an
estimate of the frequency and duration of the intermittent or reduced schedule
leave.</p><p>29 USC 2613(b)</p><p>29 CFR 825.306(a)</p><p>(2)  Medical facts</p><p>The medical facts appropriate for inclusion on
the certification form will vary depending on the nature of the serious health
condition and are to be determined by the health care provider but must be
sufficient to support the need for leave.  For example, at the health care
provider’s discretion, the medical facts may include information on symptoms,
doctor’s visits, or a diagnosis.  Whether a diagnosis is included in the
certification form is left to the discretion of the health care provider and an
employer may not reject a complete and sufficient certification because it
lacks a diagnosis.</p><p>73 FR 67934, 68014</p><p>(3)  Frequency and
duration of the condition</p><p>Not all absences caused by certain serious
health conditions are predictable.  Health care providers are expected to
provide only their best informed medical judgment when estimating the need for
unforeseeable intermittent leave. The FMLA does not permit an employer to
require an exact schedule of leave for such instances.</p><p>73 FR 67934, 68017</p><p>(b)   Medical
certification forms</p><p>(1)  An employer
may, but is not required to, use the DOL’s two optional forms—Form WH-380-E and
Form WH-380-F—for use in obtaining medical certification.</p><p>(2)  Employers may
develop their own forms but may not request any additional information beyond
that specified by the regulations.  An employer may not reject a medical
certification that otherwise contains the information required by the
regulations due to the form of the certification provided.  In all instances,
the certification must relate only to the condition for which leave is needed.</p><p>29 CFR 825.306(b)</p><p>(c)   Annual
medical certification</p><p>Where leave for a
serious health condition lasts beyond a single leave year, a new medical
certification may be required in each subsequent FMLA leave year.  The employer
may request a medical certification with the first absence in a new 12-month
leave year.  The employer may seek authentication and clarification and second
and third opinions for these new medical certifications.</p><p>29 C.F.R. 825.305(e)</p><p>(d)   Authentication
and clarification of a medical certification</p><p>(1)  The employer
may contact the health care provider for purposes of clarification and
authentication of the medical certification after the employer has given the
employee an opportunity to cure any deficiencies.  Employers may not ask for
additional information beyond that required by the certification form.  To make
such contact, the employer must use a health care provider, a human resources
professional, a leave administrator, or a management official.  Under no
circumstances may the employee’s direct supervisor contact the employee’s
health care provider.</p><p>(2)  Authentication
means providing the health care provider with a copy of the certification and
requesting verification that the information contained on the certification
form was completed and/or authorized by the health care provider who signed the
document.  No additional information may be requested.  Clarification means
contacting the health care provider to understand the handwriting on the
medical certification or to understand the meaning of a response.  No
additional information may be requested.</p><p>(3)  The
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
Privacy Rule govern the privacy of individually-identifiable health information
created or held by HIPAA-covered entities.  Therefore, HIPAA requirements must
be satisfied when an employee’s or an employee’s family member’s
individually-identifiable health information is shared with an employer by a
HIPAA-covered entity.  HIPAA requires, among other things, a written
authorization by the employee (or the employee’s family member) in order to
release information for authentication and clarification purposes.  If an
employee does not provide such authorization to the health care provider
allowing the employer to obtain clarification of an unclear certification, and
does not otherwise clarify the certification, the employer may deny the FMLA
leave.</p><p>73 FR 67934, 68018—68019</p><p>29 CFR 825.307(a)</p><p>(e)   Second
and third medical opinions</p><p>(1)  An employer who
has reason to doubt the validity of a medical certification may request a
second opinion at the employer’s expense.  The employer is permitted to
designate the health care provider for the second opinion as long as the
provider is not employed on a regular basis by the employer, is not under
contract with the employer, or is not regularly utilized by the employer.  An
exception can be made if the employee is located in an area where access to
health care is extremely limited, such as a rural area where there may be only
one or two doctors in a relevant specialty.  The designated health care
provider must be within normal commuting distance, except in very unusual
circumstances, and the employer must reimburse the employee for reasonable
travel expenses.</p><p>(2)  Pending receipt
of the additional medical opinion, the employee is provisionally entitled to
FMLA benefits, including maintenance of group health benefits.  If the
certifications do not ultimately establish the employee’s entitlement to FMLA leave,
the leave cannot be designated as FMLA leave and may be treated as paid or
unpaid leave under the employer’s established leave policy.</p><p>(3)  If the first
and second opinions differ, a third and binding opinion may be required at the
employer’s expense.  The third health care provider must be approved jointly by
the employer and the employee.  The employer and the employee must each act in
good faith to reach agreement on the third opinion provider.  If the employer
does not act in good faith, the employer will be bound by the first medical
certification.  If the employee does not act in good faith, the employee will
be bound by the second medical certification.</p><p>(4)  Upon request by
the employee, the employer must provide copies of second or third opinions
within five business days absent extenuating circumstances.</p><p>(5)  If a second or
third opinion health care provider requests relevant medical information from
an employee’s (or his or her family member’s) health care provider, and the
employee (or his or her family member) does not authorize his or her health
care provider to release relevant medical information, the employer may deny
the FMLA leave.</p><p>29 USC 2613(c) and (d)</p><p>29 CFR 825.307(b) - (e)</p><p>(f)   Medical
certification abroad</p><p>In circumstances in
which the employee or family member is visiting another country, or a family
member resides in another country, and a serious health condition develops, employers
must accept medical certifications, including second and third opinions, from a
health care provider who practices in that country.  If a certification by a
foreign health care provider is not in English, the employee must provide a
written translation at the employer’s request.</p><p>29 CFR 825.307(f)</p><p>(g)   Recertification</p><p>(1)  An employer may
request a recertification for leave taken because of an employee’s own serious
health condition or the serious health condition of a family member. 
Generally, an employer may ask for recertification no more frequently than
every 30 days and only in connection with an absence by the employee.  However,
if the minimum duration indicated on the medical certification exceeds 30 days,
an employer must wait the indicated minimum duration before requesting a
recertification (unless the exception in (g)(5) below applies).  In all cases,
however, an employer may request a recertification of a medical condition every
six months in connection with an absence by the employee.  This could apply
when, for example, the health care provider indicates a condition will last “a
lifetime”.</p><p>(2)  The employer
may ask for the same information as permitted for the initial medical
certification.  In addition, the employer may provide a record of the employee’s
absence pattern to the health care provider and ask if the serious health
condition and need for leave is consistent with such pattern.</p><p>(3)  The employer
must allow at least 15 calendar days for the employee to provide the requested
recertification, unless it is not practicable under the particular
circumstances despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts.</p><p>(4)  The employer
may contact the health care provider to authenticate or clarify the
recertification.  No second or third opinions may be required on a
recertification.  The recertification is at the employee’s expense.</p><p>(5)  Less than 30
days exception</p><p>An employer may request recertification in less
than 30 days if:</p><p>a.     The
employee requests an extension of leave, or</p><p>b.     Circumstances
described by the previous certification have changed significantly (for
example, if the certification stated the employee needed leave for one to two
days for a particular serious health condition and the employee’s absences for that
condition lasted four days each the last two times leave was needed, the
increased duration might constitute a significant change), or</p><p>c.     The
employer receives information that casts doubt upon the employee’s stated
reason for the absence or the continuing validity of the certification.</p><p>(6)  When
recertification is not permitted</p><p>Recertification does not apply to leave taken
for a qualifying exigency or to care for a covered servicemember with a serious
injury or illness (military caregiver leave).</p><p>29 CFR 825.310(d)</p><p>29 CFR 825.307(a), 825.308, 825.313(c)</p><p>WHD Opinion Letter FMLA-2004-2-A</p>

certification.</h3>
              <p>(a)   An
employer may have a uniformly-applied policy or practice that requires all
similarly-situated employees who take leave for their own serious health
condition to obtain and present certification from the employee’s health care
provider that the employee is able to resume work as a condition of restoring
an employee.  The fitness-for-duty certification can only be requested for the
health condition that caused the employee’s need for FMLA leave.  The employee
has the same obligation to participate and cooperate as in the medical
certification process.  The cost of the fitness-for-duty certification is borne
by the employee.</p><p>(b)   During
intermittent or reduced schedule leave</p><p>(1)  When the
employee is on intermittent or reduced schedule leave, the employer is only entitled
to a certification of fitness to return to duty up to once every 30 days and
only if reasonable safety concerns exist regarding the employee’s ability to
perform his or her duties based on the serious health condition for which the
employee took FMLA leave.</p><p>(2)  Reasonable
safety concerns means a reasonable belief of significant risk of harm to the
employee or others.  In determining the reasonableness of safety concerns, an
employer should consider the nature and severity of the potential harm and the
likelihood that potential harm will occur.</p><p>(c)   Notice to
employee</p><p>If the employer will
require the employee to present a fitness-for-duty certification to be restored
to employment, the employer must provide notice of such requirement with the
designation notice.  An employer may require that the certification
specifically address the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions
of the employee’s job.  In such case, the employer must indicate that in the
designation notice and include a list of the essential functions of the
employee’s position.</p><p>(d)   Authentication
and/or clarification, and second and third opinions</p><p>An employer may contact
the employee’s health care provider for authentication and/or clarification of a
fitness-for-duty certification, but may not delay reinstatement of the employee
during the authentication or clarification period.  Second and third opinions
may not be required on fitness-for-duty certifications.</p><p>(e)   State or
local law, collective bargaining agreement</p><p>In all cases, if state

              <h3>39h07 - Certification for military
caregiver leave.</h3>
              <p>(a)   An
employer may require an employee to obtain a certification from an authorized
health care provider when leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember
with a serious injury or illness. The certification may be completed by:</p><p>(1)  A Department of
Defense (DOD) health care provider,</p><p>(2)  A Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) health care provider,</p><p>(3)  A DOD TRICARE
network authorized private health care provider,</p><p>(4)  A DOD
non-network TIRCARE authorized private health care provider, or</p><p>(5)  A health care
provider as defined in 29 CFR 825.125.</p><p>The authorized health
care provider may rely on determinations from an authorized DOD or VA
representative for certain military-related determinations.</p><p>(b)   An
employer may request the following information for military caregiver leave
certification:</p><p>(1)  The name,
address, and appropriate contact information (telephone number, fax     number,
and/or email address) of the health care provider, the type of medical
practice, the medical specialty, and whether the health care provider is one of
the health care providers specified in FOH 39h07(a),</p><p>(2)  Whether the
covered servicemember’s injury or illness was incurred in the line of duty
while on active duty or, if not, whether the covered servicemember’s injury or
illness existed before the beginning of the servicemember’s active duty and was
aggravated by service in the line of duty while on active duty,</p><p>(3)  The approximate
date on which the serious injury or illness commenced, or was aggravated, and
its probable duration,</p><p>(4)  A statement of
appropriate medical facts regarding the covered servicemember’s health
condition, sufficient to support the need for leave,</p><p>a.     Current
member of the Armed Forces</p><p>For a current member
of the Armed Forces, such medical facts must include information on whether the
injury or illness may render the covered servicemember medically unfit to
perform the duties of the servicemember’s office, grade, rank, or rating and
whether the member is receiving medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy.</p><p>b.     Veteran</p><p>For a covered
veteran, such medical facts must include information on whether the veteran is
receiving medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for an injury or illness
that:</p><p>1.     Is
the continuation of a serious injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated
when the covered veteran was a member of the Armed Forces and that rendered the
member medically unfit to perform the duties of the member’s office, grade,
rank, or rating, or</p><p>2.     Is
a physical or mental condition for which the covered veteran has received a VA
Service-Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50 percent or greater.  The VASRD
rating must be based, in whole or in part, on the condition for which the need
for military caregiver leave is requested, or</p><p>3.     Is
a physical or mental condition that substantially impairs the covered veteran’s
ability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of a
disability or disabilities related to military service, or would do so absent
treatment, or</p><p>4.     Is
substantiated by documentation of enrollment in the Department of Veterans
Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers.</p><p>(5)  Information
sufficient to establish that the covered servicemember is in need of care, as
described in 29 CFR 825.124, and whether the covered servicemember will need
care for a single continuous period of time, including any time for treatment
and recovery, and an estimate as to the beginning and ending dates for this
period of time,</p><p>(6)  If an employee
requests leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis for planned medical
treatment appointments for the covered servicemember, whether there is a
medical necessity for the covered servicemember to have such periodic care, and
an estimate of the treatment schedule for such appointments,</p><p>(7)  If an employee
requests leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis to care for a
covered servicemember other than for planned medical treatment, whether there
is a medical necessity for the covered servicemember to have such periodic
care, which can include assisting in the covered servicemember’s recovery, and
an estimate of the frequency and duration of the periodic care,</p><p>(8)  Name and
address of the employee requesting leave, the name of the covered
servicemember, and the relationship of the employee to the covered servicemember,</p><p>(9)  Whether the
covered servicemember is a current member of the Armed Forces and his or her
military branch, rank, and current unit assignment, and if so, whether he or
she is assigned to a military medical facility as an outpatient or to a unit
established for the purpose of providing command and control of members of the
Armed Forces received medical care as outpatients, and the name of the medical
treatment facility or unit, or whether he or she is on the temporary disability
retired list, and</p><p>(10)  Whether the
covered servicemember is a veteran, the date of separation from military
service, and whether the separation was other than dishonorable.</p><p>An employer may use
the DOL’s optional form WH-385 for current servicemembers or form WH-385-V for
covered veterans.  An employer who uses form WH-385 or WH-385-V or another form
containing the same basic information may not require any information beyond
that specified in the regulations.  See 29 CFR 825.310(b) and (c) for
the information permitted on the certification.</p><p>(c)   When an
employer requires an employee to submit certification to support military
caregiver leave, the employer is required to accept a copy of Invitational
Travel Orders (ITO) or an Invitational Travel Authorization (ITA) in place of
the certification.  The ITO/ITA is sufficient certification for the duration of
time specified in the ITO/ITA and regardless of whether the employee is named
in the order or authorization.  If the employee’s need for leave extends beyond
the period covered by the ITO/ITA, an employer may request certification for
the remainder of the leave period.  The employer may require the employee to
provide confirmation of the family relationship between the employee and the
covered servicemember.</p><p>(d)   When an
employer requires the employee to submit certification to support military
caregiver leave, the employer is required to accept a copy of the covered
servicemember’s enrollment in the Department of Veterans Affairs Program of
Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers as certification of the
servicemember’s serious injury or illness.  The enrollment documentation is
sufficient certification of the servicemember’s serious injury or illness
regardless of whether the employee is the named caregiver in the enrollment
documentation.</p><p>The employee is still
responsible for providing the employer with additional relevant information,
such as that the veteran is within five years of discharge, the probable
duration of the serious injury or illness, and the veteran’s need for care and
an estimate of the time period during which care will be needed.  The employer
may require the employee to provide confirmation of the family relationship
between the employee and the covered servicemember.</p><p>78 FR 8858</p><p>(e)   An
employer may seek authentication and clarification of a certification for
military caregiver leave, including authentication and clarification of an
ITO/ITA or the documentation indicating a servicemember’s enrollment in the
Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family
Caregivers.  See 29 CFR 825.307.</p><p>(f)   An
employer may require second and/or third opinions when leave to care for a
covered servicemember is certified by a non-military affiliated health care
provider, as described in FOH 39h07(a).  An employer may not require second
and/or third opinions for leave to care for a covered servicemember when the
leave is certified by a military-affiliated health care provider as described
in FOH 39h07(a).  Additionally, the recertification process does not apply to
leave taken to care for a covered servicemember.</p><p>29 CFR 825.310</p>

plan benefits.</h3>
              <p>(a)   An
employer is required to maintain an employee’s health benefit coverage under
any group health plan for the duration of any FMLA leave period at the level
and under the conditions that coverage would have been provided if the employee
had remained continuously employed during the entire FMLA leave period.</p><p>(b)   A group
health plan is any employer plan, or plan contributed to by an employer, to
provide health care to employees, former employees, or the families of such employees. 
Such plans may include a self-insured plan.</p><p>(c)   A group
health plan does not include insurance programs providing health coverage where
employees purchase individual policies from insurers, provided that:</p><p>(1)  No
contributions are made by the employer,</p><p>(2)  Participation
in the program is completely voluntary for employees,</p><p>(3)  The sole
functions of the employer with respect to the program are, without endorsing
the program, to permit the insurer to publicize the program to employees, to
collect premiums through payroll deductions, and to remit them to the insurer,</p><p>(4)  The employer
receives no consideration in the form of cash or otherwise in connection with
the program, other than reasonable compensation, excluding any profit, for
administrative services actually rendered in connection with payroll deduction,
and</p><p>(5)  The premium
charged with respect to such coverage does not increase in the event the
employment relationship terminates.</p><p>(d)   If an
employer provides a new health plan or benefits, or changes health options while
an employee is on FMLA leave, the employee is entitled to the new or changed benefits
to the same extent as if the employee were not on leave.  Any plan changes that
apply to all employees would apply to an employee on FMLA leave.  Notice of any
opportunity to change plans or benefits must be given to an employee on FMLA
leave and such change in benefits must be made available while an employee is
on FMLA leave.</p><p>(e)   An
employer must maintain benefit coverage during an employee’s FMLA leave for
dental care, eye care, mental health counseling, etc. if such coverage is
provided in the employer’s group health plan, including a supplement to a group
health plan, whether or not provided through a flexible spending account or
other component of a cafeteria plan.</p><p>(f)   If the
employer is providing health insurance to discharge the health and welfare
benefits requirement under an SCA wage determination, that benefit must
continue during the entire period of the FMLA leave.  If an employer pays cash
wages in lieu of the health and welfare benefits, the employer is not required
to continue such payments while the employee is on FMLA leave.</p><p>WHD Opinion Letter

accrued prior to the commencement of the leave, except for the use of accrued
paid leave to substitute for unpaid FMLA leave.</p><p>29 USC 2614(a)(2)</p><p>(b)   An
employee’s entitlement to benefits other than group health benefits during a
period of FMLA leave is determined by the employer’s established policy for
providing such benefits when an employee is on other forms of leave, paid or
unpaid, as appropriate.  If benefits such as vacation or holiday pay accrue to
employees on other types of paid and/or unpaid non-FMLA leave, employees on corresponding
paid or unpaid FMLA leave are entitled to such accrual.</p><p>29 CFR 825.209(h)</p><p>(c)   Maintenance
of other benefits, including health insurance policies that are not part of the
employer’s group health plan, are the sole responsibility of the employee.  The
employee and the insurer should make necessary arrangements for payment of
premiums during periods of unpaid FMLA leave.</p><p>29 CFR 825.210(a),

employee’s right to continue living in employer-provided housing is determined
by the employer’s established policy.  If the policy provides that employees on
leave for both FMLA and non-FMLA reasons must vacate the property, the employer
will not be in violation of the FMLA so long as the employer restores the
employee the lodging upon completion of the FMLA leave.  The employer may not,
however, require an FMLA‑eligible employee to vacate the employer‑provided
lodging during the term of an FMLA leave period as an attempt to interfere with
or restrain an employee's attempt to exercise rights under the FMLA.</p><p>WHD Opinion Letter

employee group health plan coverage.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Group
health plan coverage must be maintained for an employee on FMLA leave until:</p><p>(1)  The employee
fails to return from leave or continues on leave after exhausting his or her
FMLA entitlement,</p><p>(2)  The employer
can show that the employment relationship would have terminated if the employee
had not taken FMLA leave, such as if the employee would have been laid off and not
transferred to a new position, or</p><p>(3)  The employee
provides unequivocal notice of intent not to return to work.</p><p>(b)   Additionally,
under certain conditions, an employer may end group health plan coverage when
an employee on FMLA leave fails to submit a required premium payment (see
FOH 39i06 for details and requirements) or an employee chooses not to
retain group health coverage during the FMLA leave (see FOH39i02).  All other
obligations of an employer under the FMLA would continue, such as the
obligation to reinstate the employee upon return from leave and restoring the
employee’s benefits equivalent to those that the employee would have had if the
employee had not taken leave.</p><p>(c)   To
discontinue health benefit coverage under a multi-employer health plan based on
termination of the employment relationship, the employer must demonstrate the
employee would not have continued to be employed by either the employer or
another employer who is a member of the same plan.  For example, if the
employee’s construction site is closed but its employees are moved to another
site to continue employment for that employer or another member of the plan, it
can be assumed that the employee on leave would have continued employment and
therefore the employer may not discontinue health benefit coverage.</p><p>WHD Non-Administrator

              <h3>39i06 - Employee failure to pay
premiums.</h3>
              <p>(a)   An
employer’s obligation to maintain health insurance coverage ceases under the
FMLA if an employee’s premium payment is more than 30 days late, unless the
employer has an established policy providing a more generous grace period.</p><p>(b)   Dropping
employee coverage</p><p>In order to drop the
coverage for an employee whose premium payment is late, the employer must
provide written notice to the employee that the payment has not been received. 
Such notice must be mailed to the employee at least 15 days before coverage is
to cease, advising that coverage will be dropped on a specified date at least
15 days after the date of the letter unless the payment has been received
before then.  Coverage for the employee may be terminated at the end of the
30-day grace period (where the 15 day notice has been provided) unless the
employer has established policies regarding other forms of unpaid leave that
allow the employer to end coverage retroactively to the date the unpaid premium
payment was due.</p><p>(c)   Restoration
of benefits entitlement remains</p><p>(1)  When coverage
lapses because the employee has not made required premium payments or any other
valid reason, upon the employee’s return to work the employer must restore the
employee to coverage and benefits that are equivalent to those the employee
would have had if leave had not been taken and the premium payment(s) had not
been missed or coverage had not been canceled, including family or dependent
coverage.  The employee cannot be required to meet any qualification
requirements imposed by the plan, including any preexisting condition requirements
or waiting period, to wait for an open season, or to pass a medical examination
to obtain reinstatement of coverage.</p><p>(2)  If an employer
fails to restore the employee’s health insurance upon the employee’s return to
work, the employer may be liable for benefits lost, for other actual monetary
losses sustained as a direct result, and for appropriate equitable relief
tailored to the harm suffered.</p><p>(d)   Employer
payment of employee’s share of premium payments</p><p>An employer may
choose to pay an employee’s share of premium payments continuously while the
employee is on FMLA leave.  For example, an employer may choose to maintain an
employee’s group health plan benefits or other benefits, such as life insurance
or disability insurance, during an employee’s FMLA leave to avoid a lapse of
coverage and ensure that it can meet its responsibilities to provide equivalent
benefits upon the employee’s return to work.  If the employer elects to
maintain such benefits during the leave, at the conclusion of the leave, the
employer is entitled to recover the costs incurred for paying for the
employee’s share of any premiums whether or not the employee returns to work.  See

from the employee.</p><p>(b)   In
addition, the employer may recover its share of health plan premiums during a
period of unpaid FMLA leave from the employee if the employee fails to return
to work after the FMLA leave entitlement has been exhausted or expires. 
However, the employer may not recover its costs if the employee does not return
due to a continued need for leave for a serious health condition of the
employee or eligible family member, or a serious illness or injury of a covered
servicemember, or to other circumstances beyond the employee’s control.</p><p>(1)  When the
employer cannot recover its share of benefit payments due to the employee’s continued
need for FMLA leave, the employer may require medical certification of the
serious health condition of the employee or family member or the serious injury
or illness of a covered servicemember.  If the employer requires such medical
certification, the certification must be provided to the employer within 30
days of the employer’s request.  It is the employee’s responsibility to provide
the certification and pay any cost incurred.</p><p>(2)  If the employee
fails to provide the certification, or the reason for leave does not meet the
test of circumstances beyond the employee’s control, the employer may recover
100 percent of the health benefit premiums it paid during the period of unpaid

returned to work for at least 30 calendar days is considered to have “returned”
to work.  An employee who transfers directly from taking FMLA leave to
retirement or who retires during the first 30 days after returning to work is
deemed to have returned to work.</p><p>(e)   When paid
leave is substituted for FMLA leave, the employer may not recover its share of
benefit premiums for any period of the FMLA leave covered by the paid leave. 
Similarly, when FMLA leave runs concurrently with paid leave provided under
workers’ compensation or a temporary disability plan, recovery of premiums does
not apply.</p><p>(f)   Self-insured
employers may recover only the employer’s share of allowable premiums as
calculated under COBRA, excluding the 2 percent fee for administrative costs.</p><p>(g)   Any share
of premiums that the employer is entitled to collect when an employee fails to
return to work is a debt owed by the employee to the employer.  Such a debt does
not alter the employer’s responsibilities for health benefit coverage or

employee as allowed under State and Federal law, or the employer may initiate

              <p>(a)   Upon
return from FMLA leave, an employee is entitled to be restored to the position
held when the leave commenced or to an equivalent position with equivalent
employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.  An
employee is entitled to such reinstatement even if the employee has been
replaced or his or her position has been restructured to accommodate the
employee’s absence.  See FOH 39L for specials rules applicable to school
employees.</p><p>29 USC 2614(a)</p><p>29 CFR 825.214</p><p>(b)   If the
returning employee is no longer qualified for the position because of his or
her inability to continue to meet job requirements as a result of the leave
(for example, attend a necessary course, renew a license, fly a minimum number
of hours, etc.), the employer must give the employee a reasonable opportunity
to fulfill those conditions after he or she returns to work.</p><p>29 CFR 825.215(b)</p><p>(c)   If an
employee would have been laid off had he or she not been on FMLA leave, the
employee’s right to reinstatement is whatever it would have been had the
employee not been on leave when the layoff occurred.  If a position has been
eliminated, the employer bears the burden of establishing that the job would
have been eliminated and the employee not otherwise employed at the time of restoration
if the employee had continued to work instead of taking leave.</p><p>29 CFR 825.216(a)(1)</p><p>60 FR 2180, 2213</p><p>(d)   If the
provisions of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) govern an employee’s
return to work, those provisions will apply to the extent they do not conflict
with the FMLA.  For example, if the CBA prohibits a fitness-for-duty
certification, the employer may not require one even though such certification
is typically permitted if administered in accordance with 29 USC
2614(a)(4) and 29 CFR 825.312.  Conversely, even if the CBA allows the
employer to return the employee to a different, non-equivalent position because
of seniority, the employer remains bound by the equivalent-position
requirements of the FMLA.</p><p>29 USC 2652</p><p>29 CFR 825.700(a)</p>

means a position that is virtually identical to the employee’s former position
in terms of pay, benefits and working conditions, including privileges,
perquisites and status.  The position must involve the same or substantially
similar duties and responsibilities, which require substantially equivalent
skill, effort, responsibility, and authority.</p><p>29 CFR 825.215(a)</p>

              <h3>39j02 - Equivalent pay.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Pay
increases or changes</p><p>(1)  An employee is
entitled to any unconditional pay increase which may have occurred during the
FMLA leave period, such as cost of living increases.  An employee is also
entitled to be restored to a position with the same or equivalent pay premiums,
such as a shift differential.</p><p>(2)  Pay increases
based on seniority, length of service, or work performed must be applied
according to the employer’s policy for other employees on an equivalent leave
status for a non-FMLA reason.</p><p>(b)   Bonuses</p><p>(1)  Equivalent pay
includes any bonus or payment, whether it is discretionary or
non-discretionary.</p><p>(2)  If a bonus is
based on the achievement of a specified goal (hours worked, products sold, perfect
attendance, etc.) and the employee has not met the goal due to FMLA leave, the
payment may be denied unless the employer pays such a bonus to other employees
on an equivalent leave status for non-FMLA reasons.</p><p>For example, if an employer policy does not
disallow an attendance bonus to an employee who takes vacation leave, the
employer cannot deny the bonus to an employee who takes vacation leave for an
FMLA purpose (i.e., substitutes paid vacation leave for FMLA leave).  However,
if an employer does not count vacation leave against an attendance bonus but
does count unpaid leave against the bonus, the employer may deny the bonus to
an employee who takes 12 weeks of FMLA leave, two weeks of which the employee
substituted paid vacation leave, but ten of which the employee takes as unpaid
FMLA leave.</p><p>Penalizing an employee for taking FMLA leave
under a no-fault attendance policy is distinct from disqualifying an employee
from a bonus or award for attendance because the former faults an employee for
taking leave and the latter denies a reward for achieving the job-related
performance goal of perfect attendance.</p><p>73 FR 67934, 67985</p><p>29 CFR 825.215(c)</p>

              <p>(a)   “Benefits”
includes all benefits provided or made available to employees by an employer,
including group life insurance, health insurance, disability insurance, sick
leave, annual leave, educational benefits, and pensions, regardless of whether
such benefits are provided by a practice or written policy of an employer
through an employee benefit plan.  Benefits accrued at the time leave began
must be available to an employee upon return from leave.</p><p>(b)   For
purposes of pension plans or other retirement plans, any period of unpaid FMLA
leave is not treated as a break in service for vesting and eligibility
purposes.  If such a plan requires an employee to be employed on a specific
date in order to be credited with a year of service for vesting, contributions,
or participation purposes, an employee on unpaid FMLA leave on that date is deemed
to be employed on that date.  However, unpaid FMLA leave periods do not have to
count as credited service for benefit accrual, vesting, or eligibility
purposes.</p><p>(c)   Employees
on unpaid FMLA leave are to be treated as if they continued to work for purposes
of changes to benefit plans.  Such employees are entitled to changes in
benefits plans unless the changes are dependent on seniority or accrual during
the leave period.  For example, if the benefit plan is based on a
pre-established number of hours worked each year and the employee does not have
sufficient hours as a result of taking unpaid FMLA leave, the benefit is lost.</p><p>29 CFR 825.215(d)</p>

responsibilities, privileges, and status as the employee’s original position.</p><p>(b)   The
employee must be reinstated to the same worksite or one that does not involve a
significant increase in commuting time or distance.  If the original worksite
has been closed, the employee is entitled to the same rights as if he or she
had not been on leave at the time of closing.  For example, the employee would
have the same transfer rights as other employees.</p><p>(c)   An
employee is ordinarily entitled to return to the same shift or to the same or
equivalent schedule.  An employer may accommodate an employee’s request to be
restored to a different shift, schedule, or position which better suits the
employee’s personal needs on return from leave.  Similarly, an employer may
offer a promotion to a better position.  However, an employee may not be

and may be terminated.</p><p>WHD Non-Administrator

greater right</p><p>An employee on FMLA
leave maintains the same rights he or she would have if the employee had

and other benefits and conditions of employment.  An employer must be able to
show that an employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time for
reinstatement in order to deny restoration.</p><p>For example, an
employee is not entitled to restoration at the end of 12 workweeks if the
employee is laid off during the leave, the employee’s shift has been
eliminated, or the term or project for which the employee was hired has ended. 
An employer would have the burden of proving the employee would have been laid

returning from FMLA leave is unable to perform an essential function of the
position, the employee has no right to restoration to another position under
the FMLA and the FMLA does not require the employer to create a position that
did not previously exist.  However, the employer may have obligations under the

restoration.</p><p>29 CFR

employment.  An employer which does not have such a policy may not deny

restoration or maintenance of health benefits provisions.</p><p>29 CFR 825.216(d)</p><p>(g)   Key
employee</p><p>(1)  An employer may
deny job restoration to a key employee if the denial is necessary to prevent
substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer.</p><p>a.     Definition
and determination</p><p>A key employee is a
salaried FMLA-eligible employee who is among the highest paid 10 percent of all
employees employed by the employer within 75 miles of the employee’s worksite. 
The determination of whether a salaried employee is among the highest paid 10
percent is made at the time the employee gives notice of the need for leave.</p><p>b.     Substantial
and grievous economic injury</p><p>1.     In
order to deny restoration to a key employee, the employer must determine that
the employee’s restoration, not his or her absence, will cause “substantial and
grievous economic injury.”</p><p>2.     There
is no precise test for determining the level of hardship or injury the employer
must sustain.  If the reinstatement of a key employee threatens the economic
viability of the firm, that would constitute substantial and grievous economic
injury.  A lesser injury which causes substantial, long-term economic injury
would also be sufficient.  Minor inconveniences and costs that the employer
would experience in the normal course of doing business do not constitute
substantial and grievous economic injury.</p><p>(2)  An employer who
believes that reinstatement may be denied to a key employee must give written
notice to the employee at the time the employee gives notice of the need for
FMLA leave (or when FMLA leave commences, if earlier) that he or she qualifies
as a key employee.  The employer must also fully inform the employee of the
potential consequences with respect to reinstatement and maintenance of health
benefits if the employer should determine that substantial and grievous
economic injury to the employer's operations will result if the employee is
reinstated from FMLA leave.  An employer who fails to provide such timely
notice will lose its right to deny restoration even if substantial and grievous
economic injury will result from reinstatement.</p><p>(3)  As soon as an
employer makes a good faith determination that substantial and grievous
economic injury to its operations will result if a key employee is reinstated,
the employer must notify the employee in writing of its determination and that
it cannot deny FMLA leave but that it intends to deny restoration on completion
of the FMLA leave.  The employer must serve this notice either in person or by
certified mail.  This notice must explain the basis for the employer's finding
that substantial and grievous economic injury will result, and, if leave has
commenced, must provide the employee a reasonable time in which to return to
work.</p><p>(4)  After notification
of the employer’s intent to deny restoration has been given to an employee, an
employee is still entitled to request reinstatement at the end of the leave
period.  The employer must then again determine whether there will be
substantial and grievous economic injury from reinstatement, based on the facts
at that time.  If the determination remains the same, the employer must notify
the employee in writing (in person or by certified mail) of the denial of
restoration.</p><p>(5)  If an employee
on leave does not return to work in response to the employer's notification of its
intent to deny restoration, the employee continues to be entitled to
maintenance of health benefits and the employer may not recover its cost of
health benefit premiums.  A key employee's rights under the FMLA continue
unless and until the employee either gives notice that he or she no longer
wishes to return to work, or the employer actually denies reinstatement at the
conclusion of the leave period.</p><p>29 CFR 825.216(b), 825.217--825.219</p>

              <p>Under the FMLA, an
employee may not be required to accept a light duty position or a reasonable
accommodation in lieu of taking FMLA leave.  However, the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) may require the employer to offer the employee the
opportunity to take such a position.</p><p>(a)   While an
employee cannot be required to accept a light duty position, the FMLA does not
prevent an employee from accepting, voluntarily and without coercion, a light
duty position while recovering from a serious health condition.  If an employee
voluntarily accepts a light duty position, that employee retains the right
under the FMLA to be restored to the same or equivalent position that the
employee had when the employee’s FMLA leave began.  This right to restoration
ceases at the end of the applicable 12-month FMLA leave year.  The time
employed in the light duty position will not count against the employee’s FMLA
entitlement.</p><p>(b)   If an
employee is on FMLA leave concurrently with a worker’s compensation absence and
the employee’s health care provider certifies that the employee is able to
return to work in a light duty position and the employer offers the employee
such a position, the employee is not required under the FMLA to accept it. 
However, if the employee refuses the light duty position, he or she may lose his
or her workers’ compensation benefits.  In such a situation, the employee
retains the right to continue on protected leave under the FMLA until the
employee can return to his or her position or the FMLA entitlement is
exhausted.</p><p>(c)   Whenever
an employee performs his or her own job for less than a full schedule, the
employee is using intermittent or reduced schedule leave and is not performing
light duty for purposes of the FMLA.  However, if the employee has already used
his or her full entitlement in a 12-month period and then voluntarily accepts a
light duty position, that employee no longer has a right under the FMLA to
restoration.</p><p>29 CFR 825.207(e),

              <h3>39m01 - Eligibility – hours of
service requirement.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Eligibility
requirement</p><p>An airline flight
crew employee is eligible for FMLA leave if he or she works for an FMLA-covered
employer, has been employed by the employer for at least 12 months, is employed
at a worksite with 50 or more employees at that site or within 75 miles of the
worksite, and meets the specified hours of service during the previous 12
months by:</p><p>(1)  Having worked
or been paid for not less than 60 percent of the employee’s applicable monthly
guarantee (or its equivalent), and</p><p>(2)  Having worked
or been paid for not less than 504 hours.</p><p>(b)   The
applicable monthly guarantee for an airline flight crew employee who is:</p><p>(1)  On reserve
status is the minimum number of hours an employer has agreed to pay the
employee for any given month as established by a CBA or, if none exists, employer
policy.</p><p>(2)  On non-reserve
status (line holder) is the minimum number of hours an employer has agreed to
schedule the employee for any given month.</p><p>(c)   For
purposes of the 504-hours requirement:</p><p>(1)  Whether the
employee has worked the 504 hours is assessed by reviewing the employee’s duty
hours during the previous 12-month period.</p><p>(2)  Whether the employee
has been paid the 504 hours is assessed by reviewing the number of hours for
which the employee received wages during the previous 12-month period.</p><p>(3)  The 504 hours
do not include personal commute time or time spent on vacation, medical, or
sick leave.</p><p>(d)   An
airline flight crew employee returning from USERRA-covered service shall be
credited with the hours of service that would have been performed but for the
period of absence from work due to or necessitated by USERRA-covered service.
The employee’s pre-service work schedule can generally be used to determine the
hours that would have been worked or paid during the period of absence from
work due to or necessitated by USERRA-covered service. See FOH 39n04.</p><p>29 USC 2611(2)(D)</p><p>29 CFR 825.801</p>

              <h3>39m02 - Calculation of leave.</h3>
              <p>(a)   These special
calculation of leave provisions apply to airline flight crew employees only.  For
employees other than airline flight crew employees, see FOH 39e.</p><p>The rules governing
calculation of intermittent or reduced schedule FMLA leave set forth in 29 CFR
825.205 do not apply to airline flight crew employees except that such employees
are subject to the physical impossibility rule.  See FOH 39e01(d).</p><p>(b)   Airline flight
crew employees are entitled to a fixed a number of days for taking leave for
FMLA-qualifying reasons.</p><p>(1)  Leave for any
FMLA-qualifying reason other than military caregiver leave</p><p>An FMLA-eligible airline flight crew employee
is entitled to 72 days of FMLA leave during any 12-month period for one or more
of the FMLA-qualifying reasons other than military caregiver leave (i.e., leave
for the birth of a child and to care for the newborn child; placement with the
employee of a child for adoption or foster care and to care for the
newly-placed child; to care for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent with a
serious health condition; because of the employee’s own serious health
condition; or because of a qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the
employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a military member on covered
active duty).  See 29 CFR 825.112(a)(1)-(5).</p><p>The 72-day entitlement is based on a uniform
6-day workweek for all airline flight crew employees, regardless of time
actually worked or paid, multiplied by the statutory 12-workweek entitlement
for FMLA leave.  This number corresponds to the maximum 6-day workweek an
airline flight crew employee can work under FAA regulations. (6-day workweek x
12 workweeks of FMLA leave = 72 days of FMLA leave entitlements.)  For example,
if an employee took 3 weeks of FMLA leave for an FMLA-qualifying reason other
than military caregiver leave, the employee would use 18 days (6 days x 3
weeks) of FMLA entitlement.</p><p>(2)  Military
caregiver leave</p><p>An FMLA-eligible airline flight crew employee
is entitled to 156 days of military caregiver leave during a single 12-month
period to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness.
(6-day workweek x 26 workweek entitlement for military caregiver leave = 156
days.)</p><p>(3)  Intermittent or
reduced schedule leave.</p><p>When an airline flight crew employee takes
intermittent or reduced schedule FMLA-leave, the employer must account for the
leave using an increment no greater than one calendar day.  For example, if an
airline flight crew employee needs to take FMLA leave for a two-hour physical
therapy appointment, the employer may require the employee to use a full day of
FMLA leave.</p><p>29 CFR 825.802</p>

leave laws.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Nothing
in the FMLA supersedes any provision of state or local law that provides
greater family and medical leave rights than those contained in the FMLA.  The
Wage and Hour Division does not enforce provisions of state family or medical
leave laws, and states may not enforce the FMLA.  Employees are not required to
indicate whether the leave they are taking is FMLA leave or leave under state law,
and an employer must comply with the applicable provisions of both.  If leave
qualifies for FMLA leave and leave under state law, the leave used counts
against the employee’s entitlement under both laws.</p><p>(b)   States

anti-discrimination laws.</h3>
              <p>The purpose of the
FMLA is to make leave available to eligible employees and employers within its
coverage and not to limit already existing rights and protections.  An employer
who violates both the FMLA and a state or federal discrimination law may be
subject to remedies under either or both statutes.  Double relief may not be
awarded for the same loss.  When remedies coincide, a claimant may be allowed
to utilize whichever avenue of relief is desired.</p><p>29 CFR 825.702(a)</p><p>(a)   Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA)</p><p>(1)  The ADA’s
“disability” and the FMLA’s “serious health condition” are different concepts
and must be analyzed separately.  The leave provisions of the FMLA are wholly
distinct from the reasonable accommodation obligations of employers covered
under the ADA, employers who receive federal financial assistance, employers
who contract with the federal government, or the federal government itself.  An
employer must provide leave under whichever statutory provision provides the
greater rights and protection.</p><p>(2)  The ADA is

Discrimination Act (PDA)</p><p>(1)  The PDA amended
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and requires employers to provide the
same benefits for women who are pregnant as to other employees with short-term
disabilities.  An employee employed for less than 12 months by the employer
(and therefore not an FMLA -eligible employee) may not be denied maternity
leave if the employer normally provides short-term disability benefits to
employees with the same tenure who are experiencing other short-term
disabilities because Title VII does not require employees to be employed for a
certain period of time to be protected.</p><p>(2)  The PDA is

              <p>An employee may be on
a workers’ compensation absence due to an on-the-job injury or illness which
also qualifies as a serious health condition under the FMLA.  The workers’
compensation absence and FMLA leave may run concurrently.  Although an employer
may offer a light duty position in the event the employee’s health care
provider who is providing medical care for the workers’ compensation injury
certifies that the employee is able to return to work in a light duty position,
the employee may, but is not required to, accept the position.  If the employee
does not accept the light duty position, the employee is entitled to continue
on FMLA-protected leave either until the employee is able to return to the same
or equivalent job the employee left or until the employee’s FMLA leave
entitlement is exhausted.  See also FOH 39j07.</p><p>If the employee
refuses a light duty assignment he or she may lose workers’ compensation
benefits.  Such an employee, however, may not be subjected to any form of
disciplinary action for having exercised his or her statutory rights to

              <h3>39o00 - Interference with the right
to take FMLA leave.</h3>
              <p>(a)   An
employer is prohibited from interfering with an employee’s right to take leave
under the FMLA.  Such interference includes refusal to allow an employee to take
FMLA leave, discouraging an employee from using FMLA leave, or manipulation by
the employer to avoid responsibilities under the FMLA.</p><p>(b)   An
employer is prohibited from discharging or in any other way discriminating or
retaliating against any person, whether or not an employee, for exercising or
attempting to exercise his or her rights under the FMLA.</p><p>(c)   Employers
cannot use the taking of leave as a negative factor in employment actions, such
as hiring, promotions, or discipline.  Leave taken for any FMLA-qualifying
reason may not be assessed points or counted against an employee in any manner under
employer “no fault” attendance plans.</p><p>(d)   Any
violations of the FMLA or its regulations constitute interfering with the
rights provided by the FMLA.  An employer may be liable for compensation and
benefits lost by because of the violation, for other actual monetary losses
sustained as a direct result of the violation, and for equitable or other
relief based upon the harm suffered.</p><p>(e)   Employees
cannot waive, or be induced by employers to waive, their future rights under
the FMLA.  For example, employees (individually or through a collective
bargaining agreement (CBA)) cannot trade the right to take FMLA leave for some
other benefit offered by the employer.</p><p>(1)  However, this
does not prevent the settlement or release of FMLA claims by employees based on
past employer conduct.  Such a settlement does not require approval of the
Department of Labor or a court.</p><p>(2)  This also does
not prevent an employee’s voluntary and uncoerced acceptance of a light duty
assignment while recovering from a serious health condition.  Such an
acceptance cannot be a condition of employment and does not constitute a waiver
of the employee’s future rights, including the right to be restored to the same
or equivalent position the employee held when the employee’s FMLA leave began. 
However, the employee’s right to restoration ceases at the end of the
applicable 12-month FMLA leave year.  See FOH 39j07.</p><p>(f)   No
provision in the FMLA will diminish any protection or greater benefit provided
by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA).  On the other hand, no provision of
the FMLA can be diminished by any provision of a CBA.</p><p>29 USC 2615(a)</p><p>29 CFR 825.220,825.700</p>
