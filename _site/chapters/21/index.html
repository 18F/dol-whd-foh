              <h3>21a00 - General provisions.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Sec 13(a)(2) provides an exemption from Secs 6 and 7
for any employee employed by any retail or service establishment (except an
establishment or employee engaged in laundering, cleaning, or repairing
clothing or fabrics or an establishment engaged in the operation of a hospital,
institution, or school described in Sec 3(s)(5)), if more than 50% of such
establishment’s ADV of sales of goods or services is made within the State in
which the establishment is located, and such establishment is not in an
enterprise described in Sec 3(s).</p><p>Additionally, Sec
13(g) provides that the MW exemption component of Sec 13(a)(2) shall not apply
with respect to any covered employee employed by an establishment which is part
of a “conglomerate” (see FOH 25o).</p><p>(b)  The exemption does not apply to establishments of
enterprises including public enterprises, and any retail or service
establishment controlled by a conglomerate pursuant to Sec 13(g) even though
the establishment is not an enterprise (as defined in Sec 3(r)): e.g., company
store owned by a coal company.</p><p>(c)   A “retail or service establishment” shall mean an
establishment 75% of whose ADV of sales of goods or services (or of both) is
not for resale and is recognized as retail sales or services in the particular
industry.</p>

              <h3>21a01 - Application of Sec 13(a)(2).</h3>
              <p>(a)   Sec 13(a)(2) applies to all employees employed by any
retail or service establishment which meets the tests for the exemption except:</p><p>(1)  An establishment or employee engaged in laundering,
cleaning or repairing clothing or fabrics (however, see FOH 12e03); or</p><p>(2)  An establishment engaged in the operation of a
hospital, institution, or school described in Sec 3(s)(5); or</p><p>(3)  An establishment to which Sec 13(a)(2) is inapplicable
because of Sec 13(g).</p><p>(b)  The application of Sec 13(a)(2) was changed by the
1977 Amendments through changes to Sec 3(s). See Sec 3(s), FOH 12b00(d)(1), and
FOH 12d00. The following illustrates this relationship:</p><p>(1)  All enterprises covered under Sec 3(s)(1), 3(s)(2),
3(s)(3), 3(s)(4), 3(s)(5), or 3(s)(6), whichever is applicable.  Retail or
service establishments of such enterprises cannot qualify for Sec 13(a)(2).</p><p>(2)  An enterprise comprised exclusively of retail or
service establishments which met the ADV test on 6/30/78 but later did not.</p><p>An establishment of such an enterprise must continue to pay its
employees the MW in effect on the day before the increase in the statutory ADV
level took effect. (See FOH 12d.) If the ADV later falls below $250,000, Sec
13(a)(2) is applicable. Sec 13(a)(2) will remain applicable to such an
establishment until the ADV for the enterprise rises to the current ADV under
Sec 3(s)(2) ($362,500).</p><p>(3)  An enterprise comprised exclusively of retail or
service establishments which was not covered under Sec 3(s)(2) on 6/30/78.</p><p>An establishment of such an enterprise would be exempt under Sec
13(a)(2) unless and until the enterprise meets the expanded AGV tests of Sec
3(s)(2):</p><p>$275,000 effective 7/1/78</p><p>$325,000 effective 7/1/80</p><p>$362,500 effective 1/1/82</p><p>(c)   Hospitals, nursing homes, and certain schools do not
qualify for Sec (13(a)(2) (see FOH 12f).</p><p>(d)  A veterinary hospital is not a “hospital” within the
meaning of this exclusion from Sec 13(a)(2). Therefore, a veterinary hospital
may qualify for Sec 13(a)(2) if the tests are met.</p><p>(e)   Schools described in Sec 3(s)(5) are excluded from
exemption under Sec 13(a)(2). However, in some cases, particularly in colleges
or universities, the school enterprise may operate (or lease for operation) on
the campus a separate and distinct physical place of business (see IB 779.302
-779.305), which invites the patronage of the public (including students and
faculty) and which standing alone meets all the tests for exemption as a retail
or service establishment. In such cases, such a separate establishment shall be
tested for exemption in the same manner as any other retail or service
establishment. For example, if a college operates a bookstore which sells at
the retail level and the store is a separate place of business open to the
general public as well as the students and faculty of the university, having
its own employees, management, accounts, and records, and meets other tests
specified in the exemption, the employees in the bookstore may be exempt from
the Act’s pay requirements.</p>

the same employer.</h3>
              <p>IB 779.309 through
779.311 sets forth the principles to be followed in determining whether an
employee who is employed in the work of more than one establishment of his
employer in the same w/w is “employed by” a retail or service establishment for
purposes of exemption. The principles may be further illustrated in the case of
a tailor, who may make alterations upon clothing in one retail establishment
which was sold in another of his employer’s retail establishments. In such
cases the tailor at any given time during the week is actually performing
alterations which are incidental to the specific retail sales of a particular
retail establishment and is engaged in the work of such exempt establishment
itself and thus is “employed by” the establishment while so engaged. An
employee would not, therefore, be disqualified for exemption in any w/w when he
is “employed by” an exempt retail establishment at all time during the w/w even
though not “employed by” the same exempt establishment for the entire week.
(See also IB 779.369(g) for the application of this principle to morticians.)</p>

              <h3>21a07 - Incidental processing and servicing distinguished from manufacturing.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Processing incidental to retail selling of goods or
services is not a manufacturing activity. For example, a grocery store may
grind coffee; a drug store may prepare prescriptions; a restaurant may process
food; a clothing store may make alterations on suits; or a repair garage may
grind valves. The applicability of a retail or service exemption to the
establishment or to the individual employees is not affected by the performance
of such processing activities which are incidental to retail selling or
servicing.</p><p>(b)  Work performed on the customer’s own goods where the
completed job will not result in the creation of a different product from that
which the customer brought in will be considered as “services” for purposes of
the retail or service exemptions, and, if recognized in the particular industry
as retail services, will be considered as such for purposes of determining the
applicability of the exemption. For example, the recapping of a tire for a
customer, the upholstering of a chair for a customer, the repairing of an
automobile for a customer regardless of the degree of repairs, the rebuilding
of a pair of shoes for a customer, or the rebuilding of a typewriter for a
customer, are regarded as the performance of services for purposes of the
application of the retail or service establishment exemptions. Where, however,
the job would result in the creation of a different product from that which the
customer brought in such as, for example, where a truck or a bus is made out of
the customer’s automobile, or where a suit of clothes is made out of a piece of
cloth the customer brought in, the activity of making the truck, the bus, or
the suit of clothes is a manufacturing activity and employees engaged in such
activities, to be exempt, must qualify under Sec 13(a)(4).</p><p>(c)   If the activity is not performed on the customer’s own
goods as in (b) above but is performed for commercial purposes, as for example,
where old tires are purchased by an establishment and recapped for purposes of
sale, or old typewriters are purchased and rebuilt for purposes of sale, or old
furniture is purchased and reupholstered for purposes of sale, the
manufacturing involved in these operations would not constitute a “service” for
purposes of the retail and service exemptions. To be exempt, employees engaged
in these activities must qualify for exemption under Sec 13(a)(4).</p>

              <p>A retail or service
establishment within the meaning of the Act is one which is open and available
to the general public, with which it has direct dealings, either in person or
by telephone or by mail. (See IB 779.319.) An establishment which merely

              <h3>21a10 - Vending machine “establishments”.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Some independently owned and operated vending machine
companies install, control, service, and supply with merchandise their vending
machines located in plants, buildings, transportation terminals, and the like.
Such vending machine installations operate and function independently of the
plant or building in which they are located, under a lessor-lessee arrangement.
Typically, the machines are installed in groups or banks, in some cases
together with tables and/or benches. There may be several groups of these
machines in one building. Employees called “matrons” or “hostesses” are
assigned to keep the machines filled, offer assistance to customers, make
change, maintain the area and generally see to the operation of the machines;
“inside routemen” may be assigned to stock these machines. In such cases where
the machines are independently owned and operated by the vending machine firm
and are attended by its employees, it is the position of Wage and Hour that
each group or bank of machines may constitute a separate and distinct
establishment; in some cases those vending locations (perhaps one or more
groups) which are located in the same building can be considered a single
establishment if operated as such. Since sales through vending machines are
considered retail, the employees employed at these locations may qualify for
exemption under Sec 13(a)(2) if the tests are met. Sec 13(b)(8) may also apply
since the food stations will qualify as restaurants. Similarly, an employee who
services two or more groups of machines may qualify for exemption per FOH 21a06
as he or she is considered engaged in retail activities and not central office
functions.</p><p>(b)  In many cases the groups or banks of machines as
described in (a) above are controlled by a central office and/or commissary
kitchen or warehouse located off the premises which purchases merchandise,
prepares food and performs accounting, clerical, and related duties. These
central offices, etc., do not qualify as retail establishments and employees
employed by the firm at such locations are not exempt.</p><p>(c)   In some cases, usually in larger plants, the vending
machine company may operate an office located on the premises to supervise all
operations of the firm in the particular plant. Such an office may include a
storage area for merchandise for the machines. The storage area and office
serve only the food banks located at the particular plant. The employees
employed by the firm work exclusively at this location and the office keeps its
own records and orders it own supplies. Hostesses and routemen are employed by
this office to service the machines located at various points in the plant. In
such a case the firm is operating a business possessing unity of ownership,
unity of operations, unity of function, and though consisting of separate
“stations” or “food banks” the business at the location is consolidated and
operated as a functionally integrated unit. Where a business with such
characteristics is located in one plant, factory, or building and serves no
outside establishments, the parts of such a business, including the office,
storage area, and food banks will be considered one single establishment for
purposes of exemption. As such, Secs 13(a)(2) and 13(b)(8) may apply if the
tests are met.</p>

              <p>A concession such as
one in a ball park which supplies its stands and hawkers with hot dogs,
popcorn, and the like from one central commissary is a single establishment for
the purposes of the retail and service establishment exemptions. The business
possesses unity of ownership, unity of operations, unity of functions, and
though broken into units known as stands, is consolidated and operated as an integrated
unit. The stands and the vendors do not have independent characters of their
own as establishments, for they are on a temporary relationship to the
commissary and fulfill the functions of departments for an establishment. Only
together with the commissary can they constitute a definable establishment.
Thus, unlike a commissary serving a chain of retail stands operated in a
transportation terminal or similar area, the concession commissary does not in
essence perform a warehouse function for a group of establishments within the
meaning of the FLSA, but is rather fundamentally a necessary complement to an
integrated retail establishment. This business operates on the same premises of
the ball park stadium, and no other establishments separate the parts of the
business.</p>

              <p>The fact that the
firm’s concessions are “under one roof”, as in the case of a firm which leases
space at an airport terminal building, a railway station, or similar restricted
area, does not of itself create a “single establishment”. (Nor is this
situation comparable to that involving the operation of leased departments
within the meaning of IB 779.225 or 779.306.) A determination as to whether the
operations constitute one or more than one establishment must be made. Among
the factors to be taken into consideration are the relative physical location
of the units, the degree of segregation along functional lines, whether or not
there is a common supervisory staff, the amount of employee interchange, and
the extent to which separate sales or other records are kept. If it is found
the operations constitute more than one establishment, each individual
establishment must meet the tests for exemption. With respect to employees who
perform work for more than one of the establishments see FOH 21a06.</p>

              <h3>21b02 - Casinos in hotels.</h3>
              <p>(a)   In some cases a hotel and a gambling casino are
operated in conjunction with each other, often in the same building. In view of
the normal physical and functional separation of casino operations in a hotel
setting, as influenced by the differences in legal requirements for hotels as
such and for casino operations, the casino will be considered a separate
establishment under the principles expressed in IB 779.305. (See also FOH 21cg00.)</p><p>(b)  In such combined establishments there are various
employees such as bookkeepers, custodial workers, maintenance workers, porters,
and others whose work relates in part to the casino as well as to the hotel.
For enforcement purposes, such an auxiliary employee will be considered to be
within any exemption for which the hotel qualifies (such as Secs 13(a)(2) or
13(b)(8) in any w/w in which 20% or less of his time is allocable to the work
of the nonexempt casino).</p>

              <p>(a)   Where membership in an establishment may be purchased,
without restriction, by the general consuming public, the business may qualify
as a “retail or service establishment” for purposes of Sec 13(a)(2) and also
may qualify for Sec 13(a)(3).</p><p>(b)  Whether such an establishment is open to the public or
is a “private club” is a factual determination. Some of the factors which are
of primary importance in the determination of whether membership is selective
are:</p><p>(1)  Whether the existing members have any control over the
administration of applicants for membership, e.g., whether there is a
membership committee selected by the members to represent them, whether there
is a blackball system by which individual members can reject an applicant even
though he might have been recommended by another member;</p><p>(2)  Whether the existing members have any control over
revocation of membership of other members;</p><p>(3)  Whether the recommendations of members are required on
applications;</p><p>(4)  Whether the number is limited in any way other than by
the capacity of the facilities;</p><p>(5)  Whether there are any genuine qualifications for
membership, e.g., residence in a particular location, position in a particular
social or economic class, good reputation or character; and</p><p>(6)  Whether the members exercise control over the
operations of the establishment. While there are other facts which determine
whether an establishment serves the public or is a “private club”, the above
are the core factors. (See also IB 779.319.)</p>

the making of sales of goods or services recognized as retail. The examples

where the principle involved is of widespread application or where field experience
has indicated a specific need.</p><h4>21ca00 - Advertising distribution.</h4><p>The distribution of
advertising is a service which is the same in nature whether it is performed
for a retail store, a mail-order house, or a manufacturer, or to advertise a
parade or political rally, or to urge a segment of the public to organize
itself. Such services are totally unrelated to the concept of a retail service,
as it is commonly and traditionally understood, and are not recognized as
retail services.</p>

              <h3>21c01 - Airport limousine service.</h3>
              <p>Employees performing
activities in connection with the operation of an airport limousine or other
transportation terminal limousine service are not within the Sec 13(a)(2)
exemption. Such activities are wholly lacking in any retail concept and are
not, therefore, within the scope of their employer’s otherwise exempt retail
business. (See IB 779.308.)</p><h4>21ca02 - Airports - aviation sales and services.</h4><p>There is no concept of
retailing in the operation of an airport as such nor is the sale of aviation
supplies, parts, or services recognized as retail in the industry. (See also IB
779.317.)</p><h4>21ca03 - Auto, truck, and trailer rental.</h4><p>(a)   An establishment engaged exclusively or nearly so in
the business of renting and leasing trucks or trailers to commercial and
industrial firms is not normally considered to be within the retail concept
since its services are performed in the midst of commercial transactions rather
than at the retail distribution level.</p><p>(b)  The rental of trucks or trailers by establishments
other than those described in (a) above may be recognized as retail. In such
cases, if the sale of a type of truck or trailer is recognized as retail, then
the rental of such truck or trailer may also be recognized as retail. (See IB
779.371.)</p><p>(c)   The rental of passenger cars ordinarily is retail. In
making a determination as to the status of rentals the tests set out in IB
779.371 for the sales of such vehicles should be used.</p><p>(d)  Vehicles used by rental firms in leasing and renting
operations are ordinarily sold after the vehicles have outlived their
usefulness for leasing or rental purposes. Such sales are included in the
establishment’s ADV of sales. Where the vehicles are sold to used car dealers
for resale, as is frequently the case, such sales are not recognized as retail.</p><h4>21ca04 - Auto repairs.</h4><p>(a)   Repairs of cars for other garages which in turn charge
their customers for the repairs are sales for resale.</p><p>(b)  Repairs of cars for used car dealers, prior to their
sale by such dealers, are sales for resale.</p><p>(c)   Repairs of cars used by employees at the expense of
their employers, to whom the bills are sent directly, are retail sales.</p><p>(d)  Repairs on privately owned cars even though paid for
directly by insurance companies are retail sales.</p><h4>21ca05 - Ambulance services.</h4><p>See IB 779.369. This
Section provides that an employee of a mortuary will continue to be within an
otherwise applicable Sec 13(a)(2) exemption if he devotes an insubstantial
amount of his time in the w/w (not more than 20%) in performing nonexempt
ambulance transportation activities. These same principles are equally
applicable where nonexempt ambulance transportation activities are performed by
employees of other types of retail establishments, such as a garage or a
general merchandise store.</p><h4>21ca06 - Apartment houses.</h4><p>The leasing or renting
of space to tenants of apartment houses lacks the retail concept necessary to
qualify an establishment as a retail or service establishment under Sec
13(a)(2). (See IB 779.317.) The sale of leasehold interests in real property is
not included in the “sales of goods or services” in which a retail or service
establishment (as defined in Sec 13(a)(2)) must engage. Receipts from such
leasing or rental activities are included in the ADV of the enterprise for purpose
of amended Sec 3(s)(1).</p><h4>21ca07 - Auto license plate sales by retail establishments.</h4><p>Some privately owned
retail establishments operate “auto tag agencies” or “auto license bureaus” and
sell auto license plates. The sales of auto license plates are sales to which
the retail concept does not apply, and the gross price of the plates is
included in the ADV for purpose of Sec 13(a)(2).</p><h4>21cb00 - Baby chicks.</h4><p>The sale of baby
chicks for raising and reselling is a sale for resale, and furthermore is not recognized
as a retail sale in the industry. Such sales are between the producer and the
grower and are far removed from the retail level of distribution.</p><h4>21cb01 - Boatyards.</h4><p>(a)   The two types of establishments found in this industry
are boatyards, where boats are built or large boats are repaired, and the
marina, which includes yacht basins, yacht clubs, and repair establishments
where small boats are serviced or repaired. Both the boatyards and the marina
usually sell boats, boat supplies, and accessories.</p><p>(b)  Boatyards are not recognized as retail establishments
in the industry and are not the type of establishment contemplated by the
exemption. A sales analysis should never be necessary of such an establishment.
A marina, however, is the type of establishment which is recognized as retail
in the industry. It may qualify for the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption and its sales
may be analyzed.</p><p>(c)   To distinguish between a boatyard and a marina note
the permanent physical facilities for repairing boats. Boatyards have facilities,
such as a railway, for taking large boats out of the water for repairs. Marinas
do not have such facilities. Occasionally, a marina may utilize manpower or a
portable crane to take a boat out of the water but this does not transform the
marina into a boatyard, since large boats normally cannot be taken out of the
water in this manner. The servicing of large boats by a marina is a retail
service because it is of the same general type the marina provides for small
boats.</p><p>(d)  Operations of individual establishments in this
industry may change. For example, a marina may, after a time, broaden out and
acquire equipment until it has the characteristics of a boatyard even though it
may still retain the title of marina. Or, a boatyard may find, because of a
change in the nature of its customers, that it now only services small boats
and that its railway is no longer in use. Thus, the facilities of an
establishment are important but not necessarily conclusive as to its status.</p><h4>21cb02 - Beauty preparations and cosmetics.</h4><p>Sales to beauty shops
of beauty preparations, such as creams, lotions, and rinses, which are used
upon the persons of the beauty shops’ customers as a part of the service
rendered, are sales for resale regardless of whether the customer is charged
separately for these items.</p><h4>2lcc00 - Contract mail hauling.</h4><p>Employees performing
activities in connection with the hauling of mail under contract with the Post
Office Department are not within the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption. Such activities
are wholly lacking in any retail concept and are not, therefore, within the
scope of their employer’s otherwise exempt retail business. (See IB 779.308.)</p><h4>21cc01 - Contract post offices.</h4><p>(a)   The remuneration which a contract post office receives
from the government should not be included in the sales analysis. The receipts
from “sales of goods or services” are the monies collected from the public for
the sales of stamps, money orders, and the like. Such sales are not recognized
as retail. With reference to money orders only, the fees are counted and not
the money transmitted.</p><p>(b)  An employee engaged in performing post office work in
an exempt retail or service establishment is “employed by” such an
establishment within the meaning of IB 779.308 unless he is employed by the
Post Office Department. If the establishment, including the contract post
office, meets the tests of the retail exemption, all employees employed by it
will be exempt. However, the employer may claim that the postal substation and
the retail establishment constitute separate establishments, and such a claim
will be allowed if the conditions for segregation contained in IB 779.305 are
met.</p><p>(c)   An auxiliary employee of an exempt retail or service
establishment performing general office, custodial, maintenance, or messenger
work for a nonexempt contract postal station will, for enforcement purposes, be
considered exempt in any w/w if no more than 20% of his time is spent in such
work.</p><h4>21cc02 - Concrete blocks and flues.</h4><p>Sales of concrete
blocks and flues may be recognized as retail sales. Such items are considered
to be building materials and sales shall be classified as retail or nonretail
in accordance with the principles set out in IB 779.335, 779.336, 779.355, and
FOH 21cL00.</p><h4>21cd01 - Driving schools.</h4><p>The retail concept
does not apply to establishments engaged in the activity of selling and giving
driving instructions and preparing members of the public for examination given
by the State for driver’s license.</p><h4>21ce00 - Exterminating service.</h4><p>(a)   Exterminator service establishments may be recognized
as retail. However, where the facilities and equipment of an establishment are
designed for the service of factory or commercial buildings and are of a type
which the general consuming public does not ordinarily have occasion to use,
the services are specialized and are not traditionally recognized as retail
within the meaning of the exemption even though the firm may also,
occasionally, render services to the general consuming public. On the other
hand, if the exterminating facilities and equipment used in servicing
commercial buildings are no different from those used in servicing private
residences, such services may be regarded as retail.</p><p>(b)  Exterminating services performed regularly and
repeatedly for a commercial or industrial firm under contract, covering an
extended period of time, constitute maintenance operations and are not,
therefore, recognized as retail services.</p><h4>21cf00 - Farm implement sales.</h4><p>(a)   Sales of new or used farm implements and farm
machinery, including such items as gardening and lawn care equipment, are
recognized as retail regardless of whether they are purchased by farmers or
non-farmers. Servicing and repair of such items, and sales of parts for them,
are also recognized as retail. (See IB 779.371(e).)</p><p>(b)  Sales of equipment such as the specialized types of
construction and processing machinery set out in IB 779.371(e)(3) which are not
normally used in farming operations are not recognized as retail sales.</p><p>(c)   Certain types of equipment, such as land levelers, may
be used both in construction and in farming operations. Where exemption depends
on the retail or nonretail nature of sales of such multi-purpose equipment, the
facts shall be obtained and submitted through channels to the RS for an
opinion.</p><h4>21cf01 - Florists’ Telegraph Delivery sales.</h4><p>(a)   Sales of flowers to consumers through Florists’
Telegraph Delivery (FTD) are considered retail sales. Under the FTD
Arrangement, in order to serve retail customers who wish flowers delivered at
distant locations, other member florists have agreed that the flowers sold by
the establishment to which the customer comes will be supplied and delivered by
an establishment in whose delivery area the recipient is located. Each member
establishment will both sell flowers for delivery from the stock of other
members and deliver from its own stock flowers sold by them, with settlement
made periodically through clearing house procedures. The ADV allocable to
either of these activities, as computed under (b) below, is counted as receipts
from retail sales and/or services for purposes of the 75% test in Sec 13(a)(2).</p><p>(b)  The ADV for purposes of enterprise coverage and the
application of Sec 13(a)(2) shall be determined as follows: Florist A takes an
order from a customer and receives full payment ($20) for the flowers plus
$2.00 for the telegram and service charge, a total of $22.00. The order is
telegraphed to florist B who delivers the flowers to the recipient. As a result
of this transaction, florist A retains 20% of the sales price, plus the charges
($6.00 in all) and florist B receives 80% of the sales price ($16). In such a
case, florist A must include the total amount received by him ($22) from the
customer in his ADV; florist B must include in his ADV the total amount he or
she receives in the transaction ($16). If florist A is in Colorado and florist
B in Illinois, the interstate sales for purposes of the 50% test as set out in
(c) below would be ($22) for florist A and ($16) for florist B. In the above
example, florist A’s ADV would also include any additional amounts charged the
customer for taxes, except that any excise taxes at the retail level which are
separately stated are not to be computed as part of the ADV for purposes of the
monetary test of Sec 3(s)(2).</p><p>(c)   In any case where a florist’s establishment meets the
statutory definition of a “retail or service establishment” and is not part of
a covered enterprise, it is still necessary to determine for purposes of the
Sec 13(a)(2) exemption whether more than 50% of the establishment’s ADV of
sales is made within the State. For example, florist A in Colorado receives an
order for flowers to be delivered in Illinois; he wires the order (FTD) for
florist B in Illinois to deliver the flowers. The sale is an interstate sale
for purposes of Sec 13(a)(2), both with respect to the florist in Colorado and
the florist in Illinois. Also included as interstate sales for this purpose are
sales by a florist for direct delivery by him into another State. (In
determining the ADV for purpose of this test, see also (b) above.)</p><h4>21cg00 - Gambling receipts.</h4><p>The receipts from
gambling activities are not recognized as receipts from retail sales or
services. Thus, for example, employees engaged in the operation of a gambling
casino are not within the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption.</p><h4>21cg01 - Golf shops in country clubs.</h4><p>In the ordinary case a
golf shop in a country club is not open to the public and cannot qualify for
the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption (see IB 779.317). However, if such a golf shop is
open and available to the general public as well as to club members and is a
“distinct physical place of business” separate from other facilities and
qualifies as an “establishment” the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption may apply if the
tests are met.</p><h4>21cg02 - Gasoline sales to truckers.</h4><p>Sales of gasoline at
the ordinary gasoline service establishment (not a truck stop) by the “tankful”
to truckers for use in the operation of the vehicle are generally recognized as
retail sales notwithstanding that discounts such as 2 cents per gallon are
allowed or that the sales are made on a credit card basis. (See also IB
779.371(c)(6).)</p><h4>21cg03 - Civic and convention centers.</h4><p>(a)   Civic and convention centers whether publicly or
privately owned or operated are normally engaged primarily in the business of
renting space to business and civic organizations attracted to the locality. [n
order to attract conventions such centers “sell” their capability to “house”
business meetings, trade shows, auto and boat shows, open-air exhibitions and
mass meetings, including the directly related ancillary capabilities, i.e.,
parking lot, recreation, eating facilities, etc. Such rental of space to
business and civic organizations constitutes a business activity lacking the
retail concept. (See also FOH 21ca06.)</p><p>(b)  The fact that independent contractors are engaged to
cater food and beverages to the various groups and participants in activities
held at the Centers does not alter the nonretail character of the Centers.
Also, the fact that certain exemptions (e.g., Sec 13(a)(2), 13(b)(8), or 14)
may be applicable to employees of such independent contractors, depending upon
circumstances and character of the contractor’s business, does not affect the
applicability of the Act to employees of the Center.</p><h4>21ch00 - Hotels, motels, and restaurants - competitive bid sales.</h4><p>In determining the
application of the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption to hotels, motels, and restaurants,
sales resulting from competitive bids are not considered characteristic of
retail selling and are not generally recognized as retail. For example, certain
contracts for furnishing meals and/or lodging to government employees or
military personnel may be let on the basis of competitive bid procedures. (See
IB 779.328(d).)</p><h4>21ci00 - Industrial maintenance services.</h4><p>An organization which
cleans air ducts, elevator shafts, air conditioning equipment, ventilating
systems, flues, stacks, and the like, and repairs and refills fire
extinguishers, fireproofs drapes, decorations, show booths, and the like, and
performs maintenance work almost entirely for commercial or industrial
establishments is performing specialized services which the general consuming
public does not ordinarily have occasion to use. The organization is not
engaged in activities which are traditionally recognized as retail even though
it may also sometimes sell goods or render services to the general consuming
public.</p><h4>21cL00 - Lumber and building materials sales to contractors or builders.</h4><p>(a)   The lumber and building materials determination (see
IB 779.355) together with Sec 3(n) form the basis for determining which sales
are not for resale and are recognized as retail in the industry. In applying
the tests of the lumber and building materials determination and Sec 3(n) to
sales of materials to contractors or builders it is necessary to take into
consideration, also, the general principles contained in IB 779.327 - 779.329,
779.335, and 779.336 which relate to retail and wholesale sales in general and
sales for resale.</p><p>(b)  The sale of lumber and building materials to
contractors or builders for residential, farm or commercial construction,
repair or maintenance are sales for resale unless excluded from this category
by Sec 3(n). In order for such sales for to be excluded for the category of
“for resale” all the tests of Sec 3(n) must be met (see IB 779.335 and
779.336). The tests are:</p><p>(1)  The goods sold must be used in residential or farm
building construction, repair, or maintenance, and</p><p>(2)  The sale must be recognized as a bona fide retail sale
in the industry.</p><p>With respect to the
first test contained in Sec 3(n) it is clear that sales of materials to
contractors for use in the construction, repair, or maintenance of apartment
houses, motels, churches, schools or other commercial or industrial structures
are sales for resale. Such structures are not “residential” buildings of the
type contemplated by Sec 3(n).</p><p>(c)   With respect to the second test of Sec 3(n), in
determining whether sales of lumber and building materials are recognized as
bona fide retail sales in the industry, it is necessary first to test such
sales under the lumber and building materials determination. If they are not
recognized as retail under the principles set forth in the determination, they
will not meet the second test of Sec 3(n). It does not follow, however, that
all sales recognized in the determination as retail are recognized as bona fide
retail sales for purposes of Sec 3(n). Thus, although the determination, among
other things, recognizes sales in other than direct carload lots as retail sales
(see IB 779.355(b)(3)), regard must be given to the legislative history and
Wage-Hour’s position that sales of lumber to a contractor to build a whole
residential subdivision are not recognized as bona fide retail sales under Sec
3(n) (see IB 779.335). There may, therefore, be certain circumstances under
which sales in other than direct carload lots are not recognized as bona fide
retail sales within the meaning of Sec 3(n). For example, some contractors
engaged in the building of subdivisions may build only a few houses at a given
time, and possibly purchase materials in lot quantities sufficient to construct
only one house at a given time. Where such lumber sales are made pursuant to a
contract, agreement or understanding that the dealer is to supply the
contractor with all his lumber requirements for a subdivision consisting of a
fixed or indefinite number of houses such sales would not be recognized as
retail regardless of whether the lumber is to be delivered in small quantities
as construction progresses or all at one time (see IB 779.328(c)).
Consequently, such sales would not qualify for exclusion from the category of
sales for resale under Sec 3(n).</p><p>(d)  Situations may be encountered where a contractor is
engaged in building a number of houses on scattered lots and is purchasing the
materials for his own use in total amounts as great as a contractor who is
building a whole subdivision. Where, as in (c) above, the total amount of
materials contemplated for delivery pursuant to a direct or indirect contract,
agreement or understanding between the dealer and the contractor is materially
in excess of the total quantity of goods which might reasonably be purchased by
a member of the general consuming public during the same period, under Sec 3(n)
such sales would not be recognized as bona fide retail sales. Of course, in
those instances where a contractor is purchasing materials to build a single
house only, whether or not in behalf of the home owner, such a sale may be
recognized as being a bona fide retail sale within the meaning of Sec 3(n).</p><p>(e)   Where the retail or nonretail nature of sales to
contractors or builders cannot be determined on the basis of the above
principles and such questions are determinative of the compliance status of the
establishment, the facts shall be obtained and the matter referred through
channels to the RS for an opinion.</p>

              <p>(a)   Sec 13(a)(4) provides an exemption from Secs 6 and 7
of the Act for any employee employed by an establishment which qualifies as an
exempt retail establishment under Sec 13(a)(2) of the Act and is recognized as
a retail establishment in the particular industry notwithstanding that such
establishment makes or processes at the retail establishment the goods that it
sells: Provided, That more than 85 percentum of such establishment’s annual
dollar volume of sales of goods so made or processed is made within the State

              <p>(a)   Where an establishment meets the requirements of the
Sec 13(a)(2) exemption, but fails to meet the additional requirements provided
under Sec 13(a)(4), all employees employed by the establishment, other than
employees engaged in the making or processing activities, will be exempt under
Sec 13(a)(2). In such a case it is, therefore, necessary to determine which
employees are engaged in the making and processing activities and thus are not
eligible for the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption.</p><p>(b)  Where clerical, messenger, or custodial employees work
for both the selling as well as the manufacturing part of the establishment,
the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption will apply to such employees, for enforcement
purposes if in any w/w no more than 20% of their time is allocable to the
manufacturing portion of the establishment. (See IB 779.368.)</p>

              <p>(a)   To furnish proof of an exemption under Sec 13(a)(4), a
retail establishment may find it necessary to keep detailed records showing not
only where its sales were made, but which sales were of goods made or processed
by it. Without this more detailed record, the establishment may be able to
prove that at least 50% of its ADV of sales was made within the State but not
be able to prove that at least 85% of the goods made or processed by it were
sold within the State.</p><p>(b)  While generally a claim by an establishment to
exemption under Sec 13(a)(4) must be supported by records, care shall be
exercised not to impose an unnecessary R/K burden on the establishment.
However, if the establishment makes or processes goods which it does not sell
within the State and a proper determination of exemption under Sec 13(a)(4)
will be difficult in the future without this additional sales information, the
establishment shall be advised of the wisdom of showing such additional data in
its records.</p>

exemption under Sec 13(a)(4) might be applied, the following illustration is
offered. The ABC Bakery Shop, located at Portchester, New York, near the New
York-Connecticut boundary, does all of the baking of breads and pastries and
the selling of these bread and pastries at the same establishment, and in
addition purchases milk and cream for resale to its customers. It sells and
delivers not only to private individuals for home consumption, but also to
certain restaurants and roadside diners located in New York and nearby
Connecticut.</p><p>(b)  An analysis of its ADV of sales discloses:</p><div>

              <h3>21e00 - Purpose and use.</h3>
              <p>FOH 21e contains
examples relating to retail recognition in the industry of establishments
engaged in making or processing the goods sold. These examples are to be used
in conjunction with IB 779 for the purpose of distinguishing establishments
recognized as retail from factories for which there is no retail recognition in
the particular industry.</p><h4>21ea00 - Auto engines or transmissions rebuilt.</h4><p>An establishment which
removes engines or transmissions from cars and replaces them with engines or
transmissions rebuilt on the premises is engaged in manufacturing and is not
recognized as a retail establishment in the industry under Sec 13(a)(4).</p><h4>21ea01 - Auto wrecking.</h4><p>An establishment
engaged in wrecking automobiles would not be exempt under Sec 13(a)(4) since a
wrecking yard is not recognized as a retail establishment. It does not matter
that the wrecking activities consist of dismantling automobiles to salvage
parts sold at retail. The sale of new or used automobile parts to individuals
for their own use is recognized as retail sales, whether the sales are made by
a service garage or a wrecking company. An auto wrecking establishment,
although it is not recognized as a retail establishment for Sec 13(a)(4)
purposes, may be entitled to the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption if it meets the
statutory tests for the latter exemption. If it is exempt under Sec 13(a)(2)
only, those employees not engaged in the wrecking or dismantling activities
will be exempt. Sales of junk are not recognized as retail.</p><h4>21eb00 - Bakeries.</h4><p>A bakery which sells
through special outlets or which makes virtually all of its sales at the homes
of its customers through driver-salesmen is not recognized as a retail
establishment in the particular industry.</p><h4>21ec00 - Canvas covers.</h4><p>The Sec 13(a)(4)
exemption does not apply to a manufacturing establishment which makes and sells
canvas products such as truck covers, hay stack covers, luggage covers, combine
canvases, cream can lid covers, miscellaneous canvas bags, or other canvas
products manufactured to specifications of the purchaser.</p><h4>2lec01 - Concrete blocks. flues, and pipe manufacture.</h4><p>(a)   An establishment engaged in manufacturing concrete
blocks, flues, and pipes is not recognized as a retail establishment in the
industry and, therefore, would not qualify for exemption under Sec 13(a)(4).</p><p>(b)  Situations may be encountered where an establishment
engaged in the sale of lumber and other building materials at retail makes or
processes concrete blocks and flues at the establishment and sells them there.
In such a case, where the making or processing of concrete blocks, flues, and
other materials at the establishment is not so extensive as to characterize the
establishment as a manufacturing establishment, and if it is determined that
the establishment as a whole is recognized as a retail establishment and meets
the other tests of Sec 13(a)(2) and Sec 13 (a)(4), the employees making and
processing the concrete blocks and flues will be considered as within the Sec
13(a)(4) exemption.</p><h4>21ec02 - Concrete ready-mix.</h4><p>(a)   An establishment engaged in producing and selling ready-mix
concrete is not recognized as a retail establishment in the industry and,
therefore, cannot qualify for exemption under Sec 13(a)(4).</p><p>(b)  Since the production and sale of ready-mix concrete is
entirely foreign to the retail concept, employees engaged in making or
processing ready-mix concrete cannot be exempt under Sec 13(a)(4) even though
the establishment may otherwise qualify for the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption.
Further, transit-mixed concrete or any ready-mix concrete with respect to which
some processing in transit is required to keep it in condition for its intended
use at the point of delivery to the customer is not “made or processed at the
retail establishment”.</p><h4>21ec03 - Curtains. slip covers, and draperies.</h4><p>An establishment which
sells readymade curtains at retail, and also makes curtains, slip covers, and
draperies to order for private individuals, may be recognized as a retail
establishment under Sec 13(a)(4).</p><h4>21ed00 - Dairy plants.</h4><p>(a)   Establishments which manufacture milk into butter,
processed cheese, condensed and evaporated milk, ice cream, and the like are
engaged in manufacturing activities and are not recognized as retail.</p><p>(b)  Establishments engaged in the pasteurization and
consumer distribution of fluid milk may also make and distribute orange drink
and such milk products and byproducts as premium milk, homogenized milk,
regular milk, skim milk, cream, bulk milk, cottage cheese, buttermilk, and sour
cream. Such establishments are not regarded as manufacturing establishments in
the industry, but rather as part of the distributive trade and may be
recognized as retail establishments. The fact that goods made or processed on
the premises are sold by the establishment through outside salesmen will not
defeat the exemption provided all of the other requirements of Sec 13(a)(4) are
met. (See IB 779.348(c).)</p><h4>21ef00 - Farm implements manufacture.</h4><p>An establishment
manufacturing farm implements such as tomato planters, land planes, farm
trailers, harvesting equipment, and fertilizer spreading equipment is not
recognized as a retail establishment in the industry.</p><h4>21ef01 - Fertilizer manufacturers.</h4><p>An establishment
engaged in the manufacture of fertilizer or similar products is not recognized
as a retail establishment.</p>

              <h3>21h02 - Representative period for applying Sec 7(i) to new employees.</h3>
              <p>(a)   IB 779.417(d) indicates that the same representative
period for purposes of Sec 7(i)(2) may be used for a group of employees where
it can be demonstrated that the factors affecting the proportionate
relationship between total compensation and compensation representing
commissions will be substantially identical for all of the employees in the
group. If a new employee becomes part of a group, all of whom clearly meet the
test of Sec 7(i)(2) based on the representative period designated for them, the
new employee may also be treated for enforcement purposes as meeting the test
of Sec 7(i)(2) from the start of his employment if it can reasonably be
expected that, considering the experience and other qualifications of the new
employee, there will be no significant difference as to the proportionate
relationship between the types of compensation in his situation from that
prevailing for the other members of the group. Similarly, if a new employee is
hired to fill a specific job previously occupied by an employee for whom
substantial information as to compensation is available, and if it can
reasonably be expected that the proportionate compensation for the new employee
will not be substantially different from that of the previous employee, the
period applicable to the previous employee can be applied to the new employee.</p><p>(b)  In situations when it cannot reasonably be expected
that the proportionate compensation of a new employee will correspond to that
shown in the representative period applicable to a group or to the prior
occupant of the position, as may happen, for example, in the case of a new
employee who is inexperienced, Wage-Hour will, for enforcement purposes, permit
the employer to determine compliance with Sec 7(i)(2) on the basis of the new
employee’s earnings experience (of not less than one month) until the completion
of the full representative period applicable to other employees in the
department or establishment.</p>

              <h3>21h03 - Regular rate determinations under Sec 7(i)(1).</h3>
              <p>(a)   A week-by-week determination of the regular rate for
purposes of Sec 7(i)(1) is not necessary if the earnings are consistently and
obviously higher than required to meet the test. However, situations may be
encountered where the test is not clearly met and specific determinations of the
regular rate for particular weeks are required. This will present no difficulty
in the ordinary case. However, if the employee is paid commissions under a pay
plan involving balancing factors, complex problems as to the regular rate are
raised. For example, a guarantee plan may operate on a formula basis which
reflects the cumulative effect of the employee’s sales work with the
understanding that additional payments will be made when the amount due from
commissions over the period exceeds the total compensation previously paid. Or,
the guarantee plan may include a provision that if commissions allocable to a
particular w/w fail short of the guarantee the amount of the insufficiency will
be carried forward as a “deficit” and deducted from an “overage” in some future
w/w. In such cases the CO shall obtain the facts as to the operation of the pay
plan and submit the matter through channels to the RS for an opinion.</p><p>(b)  In determining whether or not the employee’s R/R of
pay is in excess of 1 1/2 times the minimum hourly wage as required by sec
7(i)(1) of the FLSA, the employer may divide the employee’s total earnings
attributed to the pay period by the employee’s total hours worked during such
pay period. Total earnings include commissions, any part of a draw that exceeds
commissions, and supplemental payments, if any, that may have been paid to the
employee. Supplemental payments means payments that have been made in order to
increase the employee’s earnings to an amount in excess of 1 1/2 times the
minimum hourly wage.</p>

              <h3>21h04 - Commissions computed as a percentage of charges for services.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Some retail or service establishments compute an
employee’s compensation on the basis of percentage of the charge to the
customer, such as the charge for labor or the charge for service and parts used
in repair. Compensation computed in this manner “represents commissions on
goods or services” for purposes of applying Sec 7(i). Employees whose
compensation (either in whole or in part) is frequently computed in this
fashion are barbers, beauty shop operators, household appliance repairmen, and
automobile mechanics.</p><p>(b)  Some auto service garages compensate mechanics or
painters on the basis of commissions which are based on a percentage of the
estimated labor charges to recondition used cars which are subsequently sold.
Such payments “represent commissions on goods or services” for purposes of sec
7(i). The term “commissions or services” includes commissions measured by value
as well as by sale of services and the value of such services is ultimately
reflected in the price of the used cars worked on.</p><p>(c)   Some auto service garages pay employees a flat fee to
recondition used cars which are subsequently sold. Such payments which are paid
without regard to the value of the service performed do not represent
“commissions on goods or services” for purposes of Sec 7(i). Such employees are
considered to be compensated on a piece rate basis and not on the basis of
commissions. Commissions, for purposes of Sec 7(i), usually denotes a
percentage of the amount of monies paid out or received (see (b) above).
(However, see (d) below.)</p><p>(d)  Some auto service garages and car dealerships
compensate mechanics and painters on the following basis: The painter or
mechanic gets so much a “flat rate” hour for the work he or she performs. A
“flat rate” hour is not an actual clock hour. The painter or mechanic may work
only 7, 8 or 9 hours a day and still receive credit for 10, 11 or 12, etc.,
flat rate hours depending upon how much work he or she has done. Each job is assigned
a certain number of hours for which the customer is charged, regardless of the
actual time it takes to perform the job. The employee is given a certain
proportion of that charge expressed in terms of so many dollars and cents per
“flat rate” hour rather than in terms of a percentage of the charge to the
customer. The dealer does not change the employee’s share per flat rate hour if
the charge to the customer is changed. In such situations Wage-Hour will not
deny that such payments represent “commissions on goods or services” for
purposes of Sec 7(i) (see IB 778.117 and 779.413(b)). Such employment will
qualify for exemption under Sec 7(i) provided all the other tests of the
exemption are met.</p>

and 779.417 require the employer to choose a representative period and such
period must be designated and substantiated in the employer’s records. The
absence of such a designation is a violation of the R/K requirements (see FOH
21h01) and may be grounds for denying application of the exemption. However, in
order to avoid unjustifiably penalizing an employer in the case of a first
investigation, retroactive selection of the representative period by the
employer shall be allowed if such period meets the requirements of IB 779.417.</p>

waiters, waitresses or other such service employees (see FOH 30d04(a)), may
qualify as a “commission” pursuant to Sec 7(i). This is so because a service
charge that is completely or partially paid to such employees is keyed to sales
since it bears a direct relationship to the goods and services which the establishment
sells, and it is a specific percentage of the bill presented to the customer.
Accordingly service employees paid such service charges may qualify for Sec
7(i) if the other tests are met.</p><p>(b)  Tips, however, are not “commissions” for purposes of

              <p>(a)   Sec 13(b)(8) of the amended Act, effective 5/1/76,
provided a partial OT exemption for:</p><p>“(A) Any employee
(other than an employee of a hotel or motel who performs maid or custodial
services) who is employed by an establishment which is a hotel, motel, or
restaurant and who receives compensation for employment in excess of forty-six
hours in any workweek at a rate not less than one and one-half times the

is employed”.</p><p>(b)  Effective 5/1/77, maid and custodial workers in hotels
and motels became entitled to OT compensation after 40 hours in a week; all
other nonexempt employees in hotels and motels and all nonexempt employees in
restaurants remained at a 46 hour week through 1977.</p><p>(c)   The 1977 Amendments phased out Sec 13(b)(8) in two

              <h3>21k03 - Restaurants in private clubs.</h3>
              <p>(a)   A question has been raised concerning the
applicability to employees of a country club’s dining room of the Sec 13(b)(8)
exemption for “any employee employed by an establishment which is a . . .
restaurant”. Wage-Hour will consider this exemption applicable to employees of
a private club who are engaged in preparing or serving food or beverages on its
premises to its members and guests. Typical of the employees within the
exemption are cooks and kitchen service employees, bus boys, waiter and
waitresses, bartenders, snack bar attendants, and other similar employees
engaged in the preparation and serving of food or beverages on club premises.
In other words, the employees engaged in a club’s food and beverage service
could qualify as employees “employed by an establishment which is a restaurant”
even though their work may take them into other areas of the club premises.
Thus, the food and beverage employees may provide service, for example, to
members and guest at poolside, in the locker rooms, on terraces, on the lawn,
in cardrooms or in other recreation areas without loss of the exemption.</p><p>(b)  As described in (a) above, our position that these
exemptions will be considered to apply to the club’s food and beverage service
employees has the effect of a general determination, applicable only to such
club’s food and beverage service employees has the effect of a general
determination, applicable only to such clubs, that the employees described will
be considered to qualify under Sec 13(b)(8) as “employed by an establishment
which is a . . .  restaurant”. This means that we will not, in individual
cases, question whether they are “employed by” an identifiable separate establishment
on the premises which is a “restaurant”. The exemption does not apply to other
service employees, such as those who maintain the tennis courts, the swimming
pool, or who attend to the general running of the club even though such
employees may work in the same areas as the food and beverage service
employees.</p><p>(c)   The term “private clubs” as used in (a) and (b) above
refers to private clubs where membership requirements disqualify them for the
Sec 13(a)(2) exemption, but which offer to members and guest a meal service of
the kind provided by restaurants. Examples of clubs which may have such
membership restrictions and may offer such restaurant service to members and
guests are country, town, swimming pool, tennis, golf, ski, and beach clubs,
and lodges of fraternal orders.</p>

              <h3>21k09 - “Restaurant” defined.</h3>
              <p>(a)   General guidance in defining “restaurant” is contained
in IB 779.387. A “restaurant” may be further identified as an establishment
engaged in serving prepared food and beverages selected by the patron from a
full menu. Waiter or waitress service is usually provided (except in some
cafeterias) and the establishment has dining (seating) facilities and
equipment. Thus, establishments known as cafes, cafeterias, coffee shops,
diners, dining rooms, lunchrooms, tea rooms, etc., may qualify as
“restaurants”.</p><p>(b)  There are many types of retail establishments that
sell prepared food or beverages for consumption on the premises or for
immediate consumption that are clearly not “restaurants”, such as drinking
places, social caterers, and ice cream and frozen custard stands. This
distinction is not so readily apparent with respect to establishments, such as
quick-service food establishments, primarily engaged in selling limited lines
of refreshments and prepared food items, such as hamburgers, fried and
barbecued chicken, pizza, etc., for consumption on or near the premises or for
“take-home” consumption. Such establishments range from “carryouts”, which have
no seating facilities and cannot qualify as “restaurants”, to establishments
that have tables and booths, parking for eating in one’s car, and “take-home”
containers. Whether a quick-service food establishment is a “restaurant”
pursuant to Sec 13(b)(8) depends on the facts in a particular situation. Such
quick-service food establishments that do not provide the characteristic
employee services and the physical and functional equipment and furnishings
that patrons require for consumption of meals on the premises are not
“restaurants” for purposes of Sec 13(b)(8). On the other hand, where a
particular quick-service food establishment does provide the customary employee
and dining room services, pursuant to the above and IB 779.387, WH will not
deny the exemption. As in cafeterias, the fact that waiters and waitresses may
not be employed would not alter this position. The present examples in IB
779.387 of “refreshment stands” and “lunch counters” should be interpreted in
the light of and consistent with the discussion above.</p><p>(c)   The case of Foodservice and Lodging Institute. Inc..
et al. v. Dunlop which challenged the above position, has been tried in the
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. On 9/30/75, the court stated
that it appeared the plaintiffs (Institute, et al.) “failed to establish that
the ruling and opinion letter challenged herein are plainly unreasonable or in
conflict with the intent of Congress . . . .“ The Court granted the Secretary’s
motion for Summary Judgment and denied Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief
and dismissed the case with prejudice. The Institute has filed a Notice of
Appeal on the case, however. If the Department prevails in the appeal process,
the Institute will not be able to raise this challenge on its merits again.
They will have to wait for a specific case to try the issues. WH will continue
to apply such exemptions under the guidelines of FOH 21k09 and IB 779.387.</p><p>(d)  The “on the premises” test referred to above does not
necessarily mean a physical structure. For example, a garden restaurant or
sidewalk cafe could qualify as a restaurant if it provides the customary
employee and dining room services and facilities.</p><p>(e)   Where the patrons of a drive-in food service
establishment with no seating facilities are served in their cars, the
establishment is not a restaurant within the meaning of the exemption.</p>
