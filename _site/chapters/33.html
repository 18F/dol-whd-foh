<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>FLSA &#xA7; 3(l) gives the Secretary authority to issue regulations governing the employment of 14- and 15-year-old persons in non-hazardous occupations other than mining or manufacturing. CL Regulation No. 3 (subpart C of 29&#xA0;CFR&#xA0;part 570), sets forth the conditions of employment for 14- and 15-year-old youths. This employment is confined to certain periods and conditions that do not interfere with their schooling or adversely affect their health and well-being.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>FLSA &#xA7; 12 generally prohibits the shipment in commerce of any goods produced in an establishment in or about which within thirty days prior to the removal of such goods any oppressive CL was employed; prohibits the employment of oppressive CL in any enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce; and authorizes the Secretary to administer the provisions of the FLSA relating to oppressive CL. The two types of coverage established by FLSA &#xA7;&#xA7; 12(a) and 12(c) are discussed in detail in FOH 33a01 and 33a02 below.</p></li>
<li><p>FLSA &#xA7; 13(c), among other things, contains the statutory exemptions pertaining to CL. This section addresses the employment of youth: in agriculture (&#xA7;&#xA7; 13(c)(1), (2), and (4)); as actors or performers in motion pictures or theatrical productions, or in radio or television productions (&#xA7; 13(c)(3)); as loaders of compacting and/or baling equipment (&#xA7; 13(c)(5)); as drivers of automobiles and trucks (&#xA7; 13(c)(6)); and as employees of facilities where machinery is used to process wood products (&#xA7; 13(c)(7)).</p></li>
<li><p>FLSA &#xA7; 13(d) contains exemptions from FLSA &#xA7;&#xA7; 6, 7, and 12 for the employment of workers engaged in the delivery of newspapers to the consumer, and to any homeworker engaged in the making of wreaths composed principally of natural holly, pine, cedar, or other evergreens (including the harvesting of the evergreens or other forest products used in making such wreaths).</p></li>
<li><p>The employment of youths under 14 years of age is limited to work that is not subject to the FLSA or is exempt from its provisions.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Section 12(c) provides that &#x201C;[n]o employer shall employ any oppressive child labor in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce or in any enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.&#x201D; <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.112'>29 CFR 570.112</a> and 570.113 discuss the provisions related to coverage under &#xA7; 12(c).</p></li>
<li><p>Coverage for the prohibition of the employment of oppressive CL under &#xA7; 12(c) is the same as under &#xA7;&#xA7; 6 and 7&#x2014;individual coverage or enterprise coverage (see FOH Chapters 10, 11, and 12).</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="a02.-cl-coverage-12a."><strong>33a02. CL Coverage&#x2014;&#xA7; 12(a).</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Section 12(a) of the FLSA states that &#x201C;[n]o producer, manufacturer, or dealer shall ship or deliver for shipment in commerce any goods produced in an establishment in the United States in or about which within thirty days prior to the removal of such goods therefrom any oppressive child labor has been employed.&#x201D; Such &#x201C;goods&#x201D; are referred to as &#x201C;hot goods&#x201D; (see FOH 33a02(c)(1)b for an example of &#x201C;hot goods&#x201D;). 29&#xA0;CFR&#xA0;570.104 through 570.111 contain the provisions related to coverage under &#xA7; 12(a).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The term goods is defined in &#xA7; 3(i) of the FLSA as &#x201C;goods [], wares, products, commodities, merchandise, or articles or subjects of commerce of any character, or any part or ingredient thereof . . .&#x201D; This definition expressly excludes goods after their delivery into the actual physical possession of an ultimate consumer other than a producer, manufacturer, or processor. The term includes such items as foodstuffs, clothing, machinery, printed materials, blueprints, and also includes intangibles (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.107'>29 CFR 570.107</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>The term commerce is defined in FLSA &#xA7; 3(b) as meaning &#x201C;trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States or between any State and any place outside thereof.&#x201D;</p></li>
<li><p>The term oppressive child labor is defined in FLSA &#xA7; 3(l). For purposes of &#xA7; 12(a), oppressive child labor can and does occur in establishments whose minor employees are not covered on an individual or enterprise basis under FLSA &#xA7; 12(c) because the definition of oppressive child labor does not require that the minor employees be covered under the FLSA.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Goods produced in an establishment in or about which oppressive CL has been employed are barred as &#x201C;hot goods&#x201D; and are prohibited from being shipped or delivered for shipment in commerce under &#xA7; 12(a) if:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Such goods were removed from the establishment while any oppressive CL was still being employed in or about it, or</p></li>
<li><p>Such goods were removed from the establishment within 30 days after the employment of oppressive CL had ceased in or about the establishment.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The prohibitions of &#xA7; 12(a) apply only to the shipment of goods in commerce that were actually &#x201C;produced&#x201D; in and removed from an establishment in or about which oppressive CL was employed.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>These hot goods provisions are applicable even though the under-age employee does not himself or herself engage in the production of the goods, as long as somewhere in the establishment in or about which he or she is employed goods are &#x201C;produced&#x201D; which are subsequently shipped or delivered for shipment in commerce. It also does not matter if the youth&#x2019;s employment that constitutes the oppressive child labor is covered under FLSA &#xA7; 12(c).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>For example, &#xA7; 12(a) would apply where 14- or 15- year-old minors are employed to load milk on trucks at a dairy establishment and deliver it to households if the dairy establishment produces some of its goods for shipment in commerce. This employment constitutes oppressive child labor because such work is prohibited by &#xA7; 570.33(k) and (n).</p></li>
<li><p>The hot goods provisions of &#xA7; 12(a) would also apply in the following example. A 15-year-old minor works as a cashier in a small retail bakery that makes cakes and pies, some of which are shipped, or delivered for shipment, in commerce. Assume the minor does not handle checks or credit card transactions. Because the ADV of the enterprise is under $500,000, the minor would not be covered on an &#x201C;enterprise basis&#x201D; under &#xA7; 12(c). Because the minor is not &#x201C;employed in commerce&#x201D; or in the &#x201C;production of goods for commerce,&#x201D; he or she is not covered on an individual basis. But if this minor&#x2019;s employment was in violation of the child labor standards&#x2014;such as working until 10:00 p.m. in violation of the CL Reg 3 hours standards&#x2014;oppressive child labor would have occurred. The products produced by the baker during the period of the oppressive CL, and thirty days thereafter, would be &#x201C;hot goods&#x201D; under &#xA7; 12(a).</p></li>
<li><p>As explained in section (c)(4), below, section 12(a) coverage also applies when a minor is employed by an employer other than the establishment owner or operator if that minor performs some work in or about the producing establishment.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Section 12(a) only applies to &#x201C;hot goods&#x201D; and bars a producer, manufacturer, or dealer from shipping or delivering &#x201C;hot goods&#x201D; in commerce. To establish &#x201C;hot goods&#x201D; for purposes of &#xA7; 12(a), WH does not have to show that a minor was engaged in the production of goods. WH must only demonstrate that a minor was illegally employed in or about the establishment where the goods were produced within 30 days prior to the removal of the goods from the establishment. If 30 days pass after the CL violation, and no further violations have occurred, the &#x201C;hot goods&#x201D; will have &#x201C;cooled,&#x201D; and shipment from the establishment is permitted. If the goods are removed before 30 days have passed, the goods are permanently &#x201C;hot&#x201D;. Finally, &#xA7;&#xA0;12(a) does not bar shipment or sale of goods where the initial shipment does not occur until the goods have &#x201C;cooled&#x201D;.</p></li>
<li><p>A producer, manufacturer, or dealer may &#x201C;ship&#x201D; goods in commerce either by moving them itself in interstate or foreign commerce or by causing them to move, such as by delivery to a carrier.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>A baker &#x201C;ships&#x201D; its bread in commerce whether it carries it in its own truck across state lines or sends it by contract or common carrier to its customers in other states.</p></li>
<li><p>A manufacturer delivers its goods for shipment in commerce when it transports its goods in state to a distributor who, as the manufacturer is well aware, will ship the goods into another state. For example, a paper box manufacturer who ships a carton of boxes to a fresh fruit or vegetable packing shed within the same state, with knowledge or reason to believe that the boxes will there be filled with fruits or vegetables and shipped outside the state, has delivered the boxes for shipment in commerce.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the word &#x201C;ship&#x201D; must be applied in its ordinary meaning. It does not apply to the transmission of telegraphic messages, for example (see 29&#xA0;CFR 570.106(a)).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Consideration must be given to both whether a minor is employed &#x201C;in&#x201D; or employed &#x201C;about&#x201D; the establishment.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>A minor who performs occupational duties on the premises of the producing establishment is employed &#x201C;in&#x201D; that establishment. A minor is also employed &#x201C;in&#x201D; an establishment where the minor performs most duties off the premises but is regularly required to perform certain occupational duties in the establishment, such as loading or unloading a truck. This is true even though the minor is employed by someone other than the owner or operator of the particular establishment.</p></li>
<li><p>However, a minor is not employed &#x201C;in&#x201D; an establishment other than his or her employer&apos;s merely because such establishment is visited by the minor for brief periods of time and for the sole purpose of picking up or delivering a message or other small article.</p></li>
<li><p>If the minor cannot be considered as employed &#x201C;in&#x201D; the establishment, he or she may, nevertheless, be employed &#x201C;about&#x201D; it. However, the minor must perform occupational duties sufficiently close in proximity to the actual place of production to fall within the commonly understood meaning of the term &#x201C;about,&#x201D; and the minor&#x2019;s occupation must be directly related to the activities carried on in the producing, manufacturing or dealing establishment.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For example, a driver&apos;s helper employed to assist in the distribution of the products of a bottling company who regularly boards the delivery truck immediately outside the premises of the bottling plant is considered employed &#x201C;in or about&#x201D; such establishment, without regard to whether he ever enters the plant itself.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, employees working entirely within one establishment are not considered to be employed &#x201C;in or about&#x201D; a wholly different establishment occupying separate premises and operated by another employer. This would be true even though the two establishments are contiguous (see 29&#xA0;CFR 570.110(b)).</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Section 12(a) of the FLSA establishes a &#x201C;good faith&#x201D; defense from the prohibition on shipping hot goods for a purchaser of these goods who has acquired these goods for value, in good faith, without notice that the goods were produced in violation of the FLSA, and in reliance on written assurance from the producer that the goods were produced in compliance with the FLSA.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>For example a wholesaler who purchases goods in &#x201C;good faith&#x201D; from a producer, manufacturer, or dealer of such goods, who in turn sells these goods in his retail establishment, would have a &#x201C;good faith&#x201D; defense from the &#xA7; 12(a) prohibitions.</p></li>
<li><p>However, a person or firm that owns the goods throughout the production process, even though some or all of the production work is done by independent contractors, or subcontractors or other producers of goods, cannot be a &#x201C;purchaser in good faith&#x201D; who is removed from the &#x201C;hot goods&#x201D; provisions of &#xA7; 12(a). For example, a garment manufacturer could not claim that it was a &#x201C;purchaser in good faith&#x201D;, if it owns the product throughout the manufacturing process, even though the cutting, sewing, and embroidery work was all performed by independent contractors, contractors, and subcontractors.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Coverage under &#xA7; 12(c) is dependent upon a minor being employed in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce. Section 12(c) coverage is based upon either the minor&#x2019;s performance of individually covered activities or employment in a covered enterprise. If such a minor is employed under these circumstances a violation of &#xA7; 12(c) would occur regardless of where he or she may be employed or what his employer may do and regardless of whether there is a &#x201C;removal&#x201D; of goods or a shipment or delivery for shipment in commerce.</p></li>
<li><p>Coverage under &#xA7; 12(a) on the other hand, often said to apply on an &#x201C;establishment&#x201D; basis, is dependent upon the performance of duties in or about an establishment producing goods for commerce rather than upon the nature of the work performed by the minor employee or by the nature of the enterprise. Section 12(a) coverage does not require that the minor whose employment constitutes oppressive child labor be covered on an enterprise or individual basis. The provisions of &#xA7; 12(a) would still apply in a situation in which an under-age employee does not engage in the production of goods themselves if somewhere in the establishment in or about which they are employed goods are &#x201C;produced&#x201D; which are subsequently shipped or delivered for shipment in commerce.</p></li>
<li><p>Section 12(a) does not directly exclude the employment of oppressive CL. Instead, it prohibits the shipment or delivery for shipment in interstate or foreign commerce of goods produced in an establishment where oppressive CL has been employed within thirty days before removal of the goods. Section 12(c), on the other hand, is a direct prohibition against the employment of oppressive CL in commerce, or in the production of goods for commerce.</p></li>

Thus, unless such coverage exists, the prohibitions of &#xA7;&#xA0;12 do not apply.

<li><p><a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.33'>29 CFR 570.33(a)</a> prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing, mining, or processing occupations. This section also prohibits the employment of such minors in occupations which require the minors to perform any duties in work rooms or work places where goods are manufactured, mined, or otherwise processed. FLSA &#xA7; 13(c)(7) provides an exemption from these requirements for certain youth who may now be employed inside and outside of establishments where power-driven machinery is used to process wood products (see FOH&#xA0;33e06).</p></li>
<li><p>The definitions of manufacturing and processing contained in (e) and (f) below are intended for use only in connection with the CL provisions of the FLSA.</p></li>
<li><p>It is necessary to distinguish between manufacturing and processing only when the parental exemption is involved (see FOH 33c00). The parental exemption contained in the FLSA does not permit the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing or mining, but does allow the employment of this age group by a parent in processing occupations.</p></li>
<li><p>Although CL Reg 3 generally prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in processing occupations (<a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.33'>29 CFR 570.33(a)</a>), youth may perform certain named processing occupations that are detailed in &#xA7; 570.34.</p></li>

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The term manufacturing means making anything from raw materials by hand, or by machinery, or by art. The process of manufacturing generally involves the transformation of raw materials or semi-finished goods into new or different articles. The manufacturing process is not completed until the article being manufactured has reached the form in which it will be available to the ultimate consumer. Any occupation involved in the manufacture of a product from the assembling of the raw materials for manufacture to the completion of the manufactured article is a part of the manufacturing process, and, therefore, a manufacturing occupation. All manufacturing is processing, but not all processing is manufacturing. The following are examples of manufacturing within the meaning of CL Reg 3:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Trimming and examining of items when performed as a part of a manufacturing process.</p></li>
<li><p>Quality control and inspection of manufactured products.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleaning of a printing press and proofreading in a print shop.</p></li>
<li><p>Canning of fresh fruits or vegetables.</p></li>
<li><p>The assembly of component parts into a finished product away from the place where the component parts are manufactured is a continuation of the manufacturing process, and is manufacturing.</p></li>
<li><p>Assembling of box shook or crates in which goods are to be packed, including making of the lid or cover, is a change in the raw material from which the box or crate is made and constitutes &#x201C;manufacturing&#x201D; whether done by hand or machine. However, assembling light-weight flat-folded cartons either by stapling with a hand stapler machine or by pasting with tape is not manufacturing.</p></li>
<li><p>&#x201C;Lidding&#x201D;&#x2014;the operation of fastening down the cover on the filled container&#x2014;is manufacturing when it is accomplished by use of a power-driven machine.</p></li>
<li><p>Stitching of bags containing produce by means of automatic electric sewing machines in fresh fruit and vegetable packing sheds is manufacturing.</p></li>
<li><p>The folding, pinning, and packaging for shipment of newly manufactured apparel.</p></li>
<li><p>&#x201C;Carding.&#x201D; If the article is sold to the consumer as a packaged or carded article, as is often the case with jewelry or buttons, the packaging or carding of the article into the form in which it is offered to the public is considered an integral part of the manufacturing of the article when the work is performed in the manufacturing establishment.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Processing defined</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The term processing ordinarily is understood to convey the idea of an operation in the course of which goods undergo a change in form or substance. Examples of processing within the meaning of CL Reg 3 are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Cleaning and filleting of fish, freezing fresh shrimp, and the picking and packing of crabs.</p></li>
<li><p>Slaughtering of livestock.</p></li>
<li><p>Dressing of poultry.</p></li>
<li><p>Cracking of nuts.</p></li>
<li><p>Laundering, folding, hanging, and pressing clean laundry; and the altering of clothes (whether performed in commercial laundries or retail dry cleaners). Except the washing and drying of laundry performed in a coin-operated laundromat with home-type washer and dryer machines is not considered processing if performed in a room separated from all other processing.</p></li>
<li><p>Cutting or chipping of ice.</p></li>
<li><p>Air drying or seasoning of lumber.</p></li>
<li><p>Repairing of motor vehicles, changing tires and batteries.</p></li>
<li><p>Placing of business records on microfilm.</p></li>
<li><p>Operations in connection with bulk mailings including folding letters; addressing, stuffing, and sealing envelopes; affixing postage; and bundling mailings.</p></li>
<li><p>Painting of mine timbers; painting and embossing objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Developing of X-rays.</p></li>
<li><p>Development of film into photographs, including the use of automated systems in retail stores.</p></li>
<li><p>The cutting of &#x201C;mats&#x201D; for photographs, engravings, and artwork whether by hand, with a power-driven tool, or a computerized automatic cutter.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The following activities would not be manufacturing or processing activities:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The trimming and shearing of ordinary household-size Christmas trees with hand tools (i.e., not power-driven equipment) does not constitute a &#x201C;processing occupation&#x201D; as the term is used in CL Reg 3. Therefore, minors 14 and 15 years of age may be employed in this occupation in accordance with the other provisions of CL Reg 3. In some instances, occupations in connection with Christmas trees may be within the definition of agriculture contained in FLSA &#xA7; 3(f) (see FOH&#xA0;20b06); in such cases &#xA7;&#xA7; 13(c)(1) and (2) apply.</p></li>
<li><p>The transfer of propane from large pressurized tanks to smaller tanks of a lower pressure without the use of power driven equipment is not considered processing. Therefore, minors 14 and 15 years of age are not be prohibited from performing this activity because it is not considered processing. The basic form of the propane gas is not altered when it is transferred from the large pressurized tank to the smaller pressurized tank.</p></li>
<li><p>The packing of fresh fruits and vegetables is not processing because the goods remain in their raw or natural state. Packing includes cleaning, washing, trimming, application of artificial coloring, sorting, grading, tiering, wrapping, packaging and labeling packages when these operations take place in conjunction with and as a part of the packing of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p></li>
<li><p>The tagging and pricing of clothing for sale in a retail used-clothing shop, when some of the clothing is not salable and is returned to a central location for processing into rags or sold for scrap, is not processing. The mere sorting of clothing does not change or alter the clothing.</p></li>
<li><p>The stuffing of newspapers&#x2014;that is the placing of one section of newspaper inside another&#x2014;when performed outside the work rooms in which printing, manufacturing, or processing takes place, is a distribution function rather than a manufacturing or processing function. Therefore, 14- and 15-year-old minors may be employed in such newspaper stuffing, provided all the terms and conditions of CL Reg 3 are met. This applies also to other occupations in the newspaper industry further removed from the manufacturing of the newspaper, such as bundling, tying up, addressing, and other mailing room occupations, and to employment in a wholesale house engaged in the distribution of newspapers and magazines. Prohibited processing would occur if the minors placed newspapers in plastic bags and then &#x201C;heat sealed&#x201D; the bags for security reasons or to protect the contents from the elements.</p></li>

<li><p>Under CL Reg 3, <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.33'>29 CFR 570.33(a)</a>, minors may not generally be employed in a work room or work place where goods are manufactured, mined or otherwise processed. Goods, in this context, refers to goods as defined in FLSA &#xA7; 3(i).</p></li>
<li><p>The CL Reg 3 prohibition against working in a work room or work place where goods are manufactured applies even if the minor is engaged in work other than &quot;manufacturing, mining, or processing. The prohibition continues to apply even if the minor is working during hours or days when the plant or establishment is closed and not in operation.</p></li>

<li><p>Work rooms where goods are manufactured or processed include work centers and manufacturing operations of Community Rehabilitation Programs (CRPs) that employ workers with disabilities at special minimum wages under certificates issued in accordance with FLSA &#xA7; 14(c).</p></li>
<li><p>There are some exceptions to this general prohibition against working in work rooms.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Children 14- and 15-years of age generally may not be employed in work rooms where manufacturing or the processing of goods takes place, but they may be employed in establishments at which such activities occur if they are working in a work room or area separate from that in which the manufacturing or processing takes place. The work area must be separated from where the actual manufacturing or process occurs by a wall or barrier.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The type of barrier between the manufacturing or processing activities and the minors&#x2019; work place depends in large measure upon the nature of the manufacturing or processing operation. The barrier must be sufficient in height, strength, and density to guard the youth from exposure to the hazards presented by the manufacturing or processing process. A strong barrier of wire might be all that is necessary to constitute a separate work room. Ordinarily, a barrier at least seven feet high is adequate.</p></li>
<li><p>There may be openings in the partition, but they may not be wider than those made for an ordinary door, and such openings should have doors if possible. If dust or fumes are present, however, a solid partition extending all the way from floor to ceiling may be necessary.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Certain 14- and 15-year-olds may be employed inside and outside of establishments that use power-driven machinery to process wood products under specified conditions (FLSA &#xA7; 13(c)(7)). The provisions of this limited exemption are discussed in detail in FOH&#xA0;33e06.</p></li>
<li><p>Section 570.34 permits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in certain processing occupations; for example, limited cooking tasks, office work such as photocopying, and hand polishing of cars and trucks are permitted.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Section 3(l) of the FLSA, which defines &#x201C;oppressive child labor,&#x201D; prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from performing those occupations which the Secretary of Labor finds and declares to be particularly hazardous for the employment of children between such ages or detrimental to their health or well-being. Under this authority, the Secretary has issued 17 nonagricultural HOs.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the HOs are written specifically to regulate the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds, the prohibitions established by the HOs are equally applicable to the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds because of CL Reg 3 (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.33'>29 CFR 570.33(b)</a>). This section incorporates into the list of occupations prohibited to 14- and 15-year-olds any occupation prohibited by an HO.</p></li>
<li><p>CL Reg 3 and the HOs work together to provide a safe work place for 14-and 15-year-olds. Provisions in CL Reg 3 will not only overlap those of the HOs but will often be broader than those contained in the HOs. For example:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>HO 2 prohibits minors from working as outside helpers on motor vehicles; CL Reg 3 prohibits all work as helpers on motor vehicles.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 7 prohibits the operation, and in some cases &#x201C;assisting to operate,&#x201D; power-driven hoisting equipment. CL Reg 3 bans the operation and the tending of all hoisting equipment, whether power-driven or manually driven.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 11 prohibits the operation of certain power-driven bakery machines. CL Reg 3 bans all baking activities by 14- and 15-year-olds.</p></li>

The term &#x201C;hoist&#x201D; refers to any apparatus for raising or lowering a load by the application of a pulling force that does not include a car or platform running in guides. 29 CFR&#xA0;570.34(n) prohibits these same minors from performing work using &quot;lifting apparatus&quot; in connection with automobiles and trucks.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The CL Reg 3 prohibition against the operation of hoists is much broader than that of HO 7. Under CL Reg 3, unlike HO 7, prohibited hoists do not have to be power-driven but can rely on mechanical or human power such as those that are operated by a &#x201C;crank&#x201D; or foot pedal.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Under CL Reg 3, the term hoist includes all types of hoists, such as base-mounted electric, clevis suspension, hook suspension, monorail, overhead electric, simple drum and trolley suspension hoists.</p></li>
<li><p>Under CL Reg 3, 14- and 15-year-olds are prohibited from using most kinds of hoisting and lifting equipment, such as hydraulic &#x201C;grease rack&#x201D; lifts used in gasoline service stations, tire stores and other establishments servicing automobiles, as well as service racks and hand jacks, even if that machinery did not fit within the definition of a hoist or lifting apparatus, because Reg 3 does not explicitly permit the use of such equipment. See <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.32'>29 CFR 570.32</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Forklifts</h4>. A forklift is a type of power-driven industrial highlift truck used for lateral transportation. It is equipped with a power-operated device, usually in the form of a fork or platform, capable of tiering loaded pallets or skids one above the other. Minors 14- and 15-years-old may not operate or tend a forklift under CL Reg 3 because it is both a hoist and a piece of power-driven machinery. These CL Reg 3 prohibitions also preclude 14- and 15-year-olds from riding on a forklift and working from a forklift.</p></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Dumbwaiters</h4>.

<li><p>Minors 14 and 15 years of age would also be prohibited from operating or tending those hoists found in large retail stores that are designed to move individual shopping carts from one floor to the next. These devices, often constructed in conjunction with escalators, are both power-driven machinery and hoisting machines.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Such minors may clean kitchen equipment, remove oil or grease filters, pour oil or grease through filters, and move receptacles containing hot grease or hot oil, but only when the equipment surfaces, containers and liquids do not exceed a temperature of 100 &#xB0;F.</p>

<li><p>OSHA has advised WH that an individual performing such cleaning functions would not normally experience a first degree burn until the equipment, surfaces, containers and liquids being cleaned, filtered and/or transported reached a temperature of at least 140 &#xB0;F.

<li><p>CL Reg 3 does not prohibit a minor from performing the normal grill &#x201C;maintenance&#x201D; that an employee routinely does during the actual cooking process involving the use of water and a spatula to scrape away and remove food particles and grease from the surface of the grill.

<li><p>In addition to the examples listed in <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.52'>29 CFR 570.52(c)(1)</a>, WH has made the following determinations regarding the definition of a motor vehicle under <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/null'>29 CFR part 570</a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The term motor vehicle helper is not defined in CL Reg 3. Reg 3 prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from &#x201C;service as helpers on such vehicles&#x201D;. This provision has been included in CL Reg 3, without change, since the inception of the regulations as a temporary rule in 1938. WH&#x2019;s interpretation of the term motor vehicle helper has evolved over the years and was influenced by the definition of outside helper contained in HO 2 (see 29 CFR&#xA0;570.52(c)).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For purposes of CL Reg 3, WH considers a helper on a motor vehicle to be one whose employment assists in the operation of a motor vehicle used in the transportation or delivery of persons or property. Duties may include assisting in the pick-up and/or delivery of people or property, the loading or unloading of the vehicle, shifting property around the vehicle, assisting the driver of the vehicle or other helpers on motor vehicles.</p></li>
<li><p>A helper on a motor vehicle does not have to ultimately ride as a passenger, either inside or outside of the vehicle, to be considered a helper under CL Reg 3. But the mere fact that a minor rides as a passenger on a vehicle during working hours does not make that minor a &#x201C;helper&#x201D; under CL Reg 3.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Section 570.34(k) permits 14- and 15-year-olds to load onto and unload from motor vehicles the light, personal, non-powered hand tools, personal protective equipment, and other personal items that they will use as part of their employment under certain conditions (see FOH&#xA0;33d05).</p></li>

<li><p>Section 570.33(j) prohibits the employment of minors under 16 years of age in youth peddling or as door-to-door salespersons&#x2014;selling such things as candy, greeting cards, calendars, etc. Youth peddlers often perform motor vehicle helper duties prohibited by CL Reg 3 (see FOH 33c07(c)(2)b.).</p></li>
<li><p>Minors who are illegally employed as youth peddlers often do more than simply ride in the crew leader&#x2019;s van or automobile while being transported to the sales areas&#x2014;they often facilitate the sales operations by performing such activities as sorting merchandise and packing peddler&#x2019;s kits while in transit, or loading and unloading the merchandise being sold. When performing these tasks, the youth peddlers are also engaged as helpers on a motor vehicle under CL Reg 3.</p></li>

<li><p>Toasters. <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.34'>29 CFR 570.34(i)</a> permits 14- and 15-year-old minors to operate certain machines, including toasters.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>WH has long interpreted the term toaster to mean that type of equipment that was generally found in snack bars and lunch counters when CL Reg 3 was issued and used to toast such items as slices of bread and English muffins. This includes such equipment as the two- or four-slice &#x201C;pop-up&#x201D; toasters similar to those manufactured for home use and the small conveyor-type bread toasters now often found at self-service breakfast buffets (see 75 FR 28409).</p></li>
<li><p>Broilers, automatic broiler systems, high speed ovens, and rapid toaster machines used at quick service restaurants to toast such items as buns, bagels, and muffins&#x2014;all of which operate at high temperatures, often in excess of 500 degrees Fahrenheit&#x2014;are not toasters under CL Reg 3 and minors must be at least 16 years of age to operate them (see 75 FR 28409). One rapid toaster that 14- and 15-year-olds are not permitted to operate is the Model VCT-200.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Broilers, including Automatic Broiler Systems</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are prohibited from performing all baking activities, including operating most ovens, and from cooking with all broilers. Some electric and gas grills that have solid cooking surfaces on top, are also equipped with a broiler under the grill that takes advantage of the single source of heat (electric element or gas flame). Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may cook with such grills, but may not use the broilers.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic Broiler Systems (see 29 CFR&#xA0;570.34(c)). Fourteen and fifteen year olds are prohibited from operating automatic broilers and cooking systems, such as those produced by the Neico Automatic Broilers. NEICO broilers &#x2013; also called Flexi-Chef&#xAE; Cooking Systems &#x2013; and other automatic broiler systems use a combination of convection and radiant heat to flame broil a wide variety of items. These items include ribs, chicken, steak, hamburgers, seafood, nachos, vegetables and breadsticks. Automatic broilers, which can be powered by electric, natural gas, or propane, often operate at temperatures in excess of 500 &#xB0;F.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Automatic broilers may operate using a conveyor or system of conveyors. The product is simply placed on the conveyor at the feed-end and it flows through to the discharge-end, flame broiled on both sides at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>On some systems, called return-flow broilers, the product is both fed and returned on the same end of the broiler. Some automatic broilers also feature up to four independently timed conveyor belts, allowing the user to broil up to four separate items at the same time. The broilers may also have a &#x201C;meat holding unit&#x201D; for limited product holding after broiling and a &#x201C;bun-grill&#x201D; for toasting buns.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforcement experience indicates that these automatic broilers are used in a variety of food service establishments.</p></li>

<li><p>Rotisseries (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.34'>29 CFR 570.34(c)</a>). A rotisserie is a device that cooks food while it slowly rotates. Heating sources may be electricity, gas, charcoal, or wood. A rotisserie contains a spit fitted with a pair of prongs that slide along its length. Food (usually meat) is impaled on the spit and the prongs (which are inserted on each side of the food) are screwed tightly into place to hold the food securely. Modern rotisseries have a motor that automatically turns the shaft, while their predecessors relied on human power.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are prohibited from cooking with rotisseries.</p></li>
<li><p>Not included in the CL Reg 3 prohibition regarding the operation of rotisseries would be those pieces of equipment, often used at movie theaters, amusement parks, and snack bars, that heat and maintain the temperature of pre-cooked hot dogs and sausages. Such permitted pieces of equipment include &#x201C;roller grills&#x201D; consisting of a horizontal surface composed of a series or rotating cylinders upon which the hot dogs are heated and &#x201C;rotisserie cabinets&#x201D; where the hot dogs are placed on &#x201C;spikes&#x201D; or &#x201C;cradles&#x201D; and then &#x201C;orbit&#x201D; around or past a heat source.</p></li>

<p>The &#x201C;Blizzard,&#x201D; a trademarked product of Dairy Queen, is made from soft ice cream. Although somewhat similar to a milk shake, the Blizzard is very thick and cannot be poured. The customer selects ingredients, such as chocolate, fruit, or different kinds of candy, to be added to the soft ice cream. All the ingredients are placed in a cup and then blended or mixed by the Blizzard machine. Because these machines act as a milk shake blender, a machine specifically permitted by 29 CFR&#xA0;570.34(i), 14- and 15-year-olds may operate both the Dairy Queen Blizzard Flavor Treat machine or the Whisper Quiet Mix-N-Blend Machine.</p>

<li><p><a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.33'>29 CFR 570.33(i)</a> prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in work in freezers and meat coolers. These same regulations ban most work in the preparation of meat for sale.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, minors would be prohibited from working as dairy stock clerks handling ice cream, meat clerks, deli clerks, or frozen-food stock clerks, where their duties would require them to enter and remain in meat coolers or freezers for prolonged periods of time. CL Reg 3 also prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from taking inventory or performing cleanup work which would require the minors to remain in the freezer or meat cooler for extended periods of time (see 75 FR 28411-12).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A meat cooler for purposes of <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.33'>29 CFR 570.33(i)</a>, is any confined, refrigerated area within a retail or food service establishment where meat products are received, cut, trimmed, or otherwise processed, stored and handled. A meat cooler will often contain equipment such as band saws, meat grinders, slicers, and other dangerous power-driven machinery. It may also have conveyor systems to move products and a &#x201C;wrapping station&#x201D; to package products.</p></li>
<li><p>Not included in the definition of a meat cooler are those coolers that are used merely to store items such as beverages, produce, dairy products, and/or prepackaged meat products such as hot dogs, luncheon meats or bacon.</p></li>

Section 570.34(l) was incorporated into the Regulation by the 2008 Final Rule and replaces an enforcement position previously adopted by WH.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The core and defining duty of a lifeguard is to rescue swimmers in danger of drowning, often by entering the water and physically bringing the swimmer to safety (see 75 FR 28418). CL Reg. 3 now prohibits the employment of anyone under 15 years of age to perform this core duty; and 15-year-olds may do so only when properly certified.</p></li>
<li><p>Any employee under the age of 16 whose duties include this core duty&#x2014;such as a &#x201C;junior lifeguard&#x201D; or a &#x201C;swim teacher aide&#x201D;&#x2014;or whose employment could place him or her in a situation where the employer would reasonably expect him or her to perform such rescue duties, would be performing the duties of a lifeguard while working is such a position. For such employment to comply with CL Reg. 3, the employee must be at least 15 years of age and be properly certified.</p></li>
<li><p>A 15-year-old who has been properly certified as a lifeguard, may also serve as a swimming instructor, but only when he or she has also been properly certified as a swimming instructor by the American Red Cross or some other recognized certifying agency (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.34'>29 CFR 570.34(l)(2)</a>).</p></li>

<li><p>The provisions of &#xA7; 570.34(l) apply irrespective of who owns, operates, or manages the pool. Therefore, such minors could be employed at hotel pools, apartment complex pools, and homeowner association pools, as well as community pools.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Water amusement parks</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Properly certified 15-year-olds may be employed as lifeguards at most facilities of a water amusement park. A water amusement park means an establishment that not only encompasses the features of a traditional swimming pool, but also includes such additional attractions as wave pools, lazy rivers, baby pools, activities areas, and elevated water slides.</p></li>
<li><p>Fifteen- year-olds may serve as lifeguards at the wave pools, the lazy rivers, the activities areas, the baby pools, and at the receiving or splashdown areas of the elevated water slides.</p></li>
<li><p>Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may not be stationed at the top of an elevated water slide to monitor the slide operations, keep order, and serve as &#x201C;dispatcher&#x201D; to ensure patrons properly ride the slide. The general prohibition against operating or tending power-driven equipment contained in CL Reg. 3 prohibits youth under 16 from performing these &#x201C;nontraditional&#x201D; lifeguard duties at the top or on the stairs of an elevated slide. This same prohibition prevents youth under 16 from being employed to operate or tend, or serve as &#x201C;attendants&#x201D; on, amusement park rides</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Natural environments. No one under 16 years of age may be employed as a lifeguard at rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, quarries, reservoirs, wharfs, piers, canals, oceanside beaches, nor other natural environments.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The duties 15-year-old lifeguards may perform include the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Rescuing swimmers in danger of drowning,</p></li>
<li><p>Monitoring activities at poolside to prevent accidents,</p></li>
<li><p>Providing swimming lessons, but only if properly certified to do so (see FOH&#xA0;33d06(e)(3)a below,</p></li>

<li><p>Helping maintain order and cleanliness in the pool and pool areas,</p></li>
<li><p>Conducting and officiating at swim meets,</p></li>
<li><p>Administering first aid,</p></li>
<li><p>Checking in and out items such as towels, and personal items such as rings, watches, and apparel,</p></li>
<li><p>Using a ladder to access and descend from a lifeguard chair,</p></li>
<li><p>Using hand tools to clean the pool and pool area, and</p></li>
<li><p>Testing and recording water quality for temperature and/or Ph levels, using all of the tools of the testing process including adding chemicals to the test water sample.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The duties 15-year-old lifeguards may not perform include the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Such youth may not enter or work in any mechanical room or chemical storage area, including any areas where the filtration and chlorinating systems are housed.</p></li>
<li><p>Such youth may not operate or tend any power-driven equipment, including power-driven elevated water slides often found at water amusement parks and some swimming pools.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>CL Reg. 3 prohibits the employment of youths under 16 years of age as dispatchers or attendants at the top of elevated water slides performing such tasks as maintaining order, directing patrons as to when to depart the top of the slide, and ensuring that patrons have begun their &#x201C;ride&#x201D; safely (see &#xA7;&#xA0;570.34(l)(2)).</p></li>
<li><p>Properly certified 15-year-old lifeguards may be stationed at the &#x201C;splashdown pools&#x201D; at the bottom of the elevated water slides to perform those permitted duties listed in FOH 33d06(b) above.</p></li>
<li><p>The prohibition concerning tending power-driven water slides would not apply to those small water slides designed for use by very small children and often located in &#x201C;baby pools.&#x201D; These slides normally rise no more than five or ten feet are accessed by ramps that patrons walk up rather than stairways or ladders. Properly certified 15-year-old lifeguards may tend these little slides designed for very small children.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Certification</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.34'>29 CFR 570.34(l)</a> requires that 15-year-olds be trained and certified in water safety and aquatics by the American Red Cross or a similar certifying agency, before they may be employed as lifeguards or to perform the core duties of a lifeguard as discussed in FOH 33d06(a)(1) above.</p></li>
<li><p>Normally, the youth will have in his or her custody a certificate documenting that he or she has successfully completed all classroom and practical skill sets necessary for certification as a lifeguard. Such certification will normally be sufficient for purposes of establishing compliance with this portion of CL Reg. 3.</p></li>
<li><p>As per &#xA7; 570.34(l)(2), 15-year-olds who, as part of their employment, serve as swimming instructors&#x2014;teaching others how to swim&#x2014;must not only hold proper certification as a lifeguard, but must also be certified as a swimming instructor by the American Red Cross or some other recognized certifying organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Once a lifeguard turns 16 years of age, this dual requirement for certification, just as all the other provisions of CL Reg. 3, end.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>If the minor is under 16 years of age, he or she may not be employed in an actual manufacturing or mining occupation, or in an occupation covered by a non-agricultural HO.

<li><p>If the minor is under 16 years of age, the CL Reg. 3 hours standards would not apply to the youth when he or she was employed by a business owned by his or her parent or a person standing in place of his or her parent.</p></li>

<li><p>The exemption applies only when the parent is the sole employer of the minor. If the parent is a partner in a partnership or an officer of a corporation the parental exemption does not apply unless the parents are the only members of the partnership or the sole owners of the corporation.</p></li>
<li><p>The parental exemption in the FLSA was included to permit children to be employed in some occupations by their parents on the basis that a parent&#x2019;s natural concern for his or her child&#x2019;s well-being would serve to protect the child.</p></li>
<li><p>Application of this exemption is limited to the employment of children exclusively by their parents. Any other applications would render the safeguard mentioned above ineffective. The sole owner of a business is in a position to regulate the duties of his or her child and provide guidance. Where the ownership of the corporation or partnership is vested in persons other than the parent, the child is responsible to persons other than his or her parent &#x2013; his or her duties are regulated by the corporation or partnership.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Section 13(c) provides that Sec 12 will apply to minors under 16 years of age employed in hazardous occupations in agriculture unless employed by a parent or person standing in the place of a parent. (See FOH 33f03.) Thus, the exemption for minors below the age of 16 employed in agriculture outside of school hours is limited to occupations which have not been declared hazardous.</p></li>
<li><p>The definition of &#x201C;agriculture&#x201D; in Sec 3(f) determines whether an employee is &#x201C;employed in agriculture&#x201D; for purposes of Sec 13(c)(1) or (2), regardless of whether or not the employment is subject to the (6)(a)(5) MW.</p></li>
<li><p>The term &#x201C;outside of school hours&#x201D; refers to the hours before and after school, holidays, Saturday, Sunday, vacation time, and any day when the school in the district where the minor is living is not in session.</p></li>

<p>[Rev. 599, 12/28/93]</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The minimum age is 16 for employment in agriculture during school hours unless:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The minor is employed exclusively by his or her parent or by a person standing in the place of his or her parent.</p></li>
<li><p>The minor has completed his or her high school course.</p></li>
<li><p>The minor is below the eligible entrance age in the state. In states where there is no written eligible age, the compulsory age becomes the eligible age.</p></li>
<li><p>The school, which the minor normally attends or would normally attend in the district where he or she is living, is closed for crop vacation or any other reason. In some communities, one school may close for crop vacation while others in the same community remain in session. The Inv will need to find out which public or parochial school the minor attends and in the case of the migrant minor, which public school he or she would normally attend.</p></li>
<li><p>The school, due to crowded conditions, is operating on a split shift basis. Under this plan the school day is divided into half-day sessions. Some children attend classes in the morning and others in the afternoon. The children under these circumstances could be legally employed in agriculture the half-day they are not required to attend school.</p></li>
<li><p>The administrative unit, such as the high school or junior high school which the minor attends, is closed. The exemption makes no provision for the release of individual children or any class or grade to work in agriculture.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Minors below 16 years of age may not be employed in AG H.O.s except where employed by a parent or person standing in the place of a parent on a farm owned or operated by the parent or person standing in place thereof (see FOH 33f03). Thus, the employment during school hours of minors under 16 years of age under the conditions set forth in FOH 33f02(a)(2) through (6) above is permitted only where the minor does not engage in such hazardous work.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Section 13(c)(2) reads as follows: &#x201C;The provisions of section 12 of this title relating to child labor shall apply to an employee below the age of sixteen employed in agriculture in an occupation that the Secretary of Labor finds and declares to be particularly hazardous for the employment of children below the age of 16, except where such employee is employed by his parent or by a person standing in the place of his parent on a farm owned or operated by such parent or person.&#x201D;</p></li>
<li><p>The 16-year minimum age for agricultural employment in occupations declared to be hazardous applies to covered agricultural employment which meets the definition given in Sec 3(f) and without regard to whether or not such employment is subject to the MW provided by Sec 6(a)(5). The 16-year minimum age does not depend upon whether or not the employment is &#x201C;outside school hours.&#x201D; Thus, the 16-year minimum age for such hazardous occupations applies during vacation periods as well as hours before and after school or on nonschool days.</p></li>
<li><p>The parental exemption from the Ag H.O.s in Sec 13(c)(2) from the HO/A applies to the minor&#x2019;s natural parent or to a &#x201C;person standing in the place of his parent&#x201D;, as long as the employment is on a farm owned or operated by such parent or person.</p></li>
<li><p>Owned by the parent or person standing in the place of the parent includes part ownership as a partner in a partnership or as an officer of a corporation which owns the farm if the ownership interest in the partnership or corporation is substantial.</p></li>
<li><p>Operated by the parent or person standing in the place of the parent means that the person exerts active and direct control over the operation of the farm or ranch by making day-to-day decisions affecting basic income, assigning work, hiring and firing employees and exercising direct supervision of the farm or ranch work. Ranch managers, therefore, who meet these criteria could employ his or her own children under 16 on the ranch they operate without regard to the provisions of the HO/A.</p></li>
<li><p>The 18-year minimum age set by the 17 nonagricultural HOs (see FOH 33h), does not apply to an employee employed in &#x201C;agriculture&#x201D; as defined in &#xA7; 3(f). For example, if a minor under 18 is employed in agriculture and works as a driver on a motor vehicle, HO 2 does not apply even though the minor may go &#x201C;in or about&#x201D; a producing establishment to deliver the farmer&#x2019;s products. On the other hand, if the minor&#x2019;s employment does not meet the tests in Sec 3(f), HO 2 would apply in the normal manner. If a minor under 16 is employed in agriculture as defined in Sec 3(f), he or she is subject only to the hazardous occupation orders in agriculture set forth in (g) below.</p></li>
<li><p>The following occupations in agriculture have been declared hazardous by the Secretary of Labor for the employment of minors under 16 years of age:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Operating a tractor of over 20 PTO (power takeoff) horsepower, or connecting or disconnecting an implement or any of its parts to or from such a tractor:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Farm tractors overturn easily and the operator or passenger may be seriously injured. Serious injuries are complicated if the accident occurs in an isolated area and is not discovered quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>The rotating drive mechanisms of implements or power takeoff drives inflict serious injuries if parts of the body or clothing come in contact with the exposed driveshaft or moving parts.</p></li>
<li><p>Persons under 16 may operate garden-type tractors.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Operating or assisting to operate (including starting, stopping, adjusting, feeding, or any other activity involving physical contact associated with the operation) any of the following machines:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Corn picker, cotton picker, grain combine, hay mower, forage harvester, hay baler, potato digger, or mobile pea viner.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>These machines use rotary gears, revolving shafts, driving chains, belts, augers, conveyor belts and chains, knives, blowers, levers, and hydraulic pistons to grasp, cut, pound, grind, convey, compress, push, or pull material.</p></li>
<li><p>The farm worker sometimes comes in contact with the moving parts and is seriously injured when he or she tries to unclog, repair, or adjust the machine when the motor is running.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Feed grinder, crop dryer, forage blower, auger conveyor, or the unloading mechanism of a nongravity-type self loading wagon or trailer.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>These machines, except for some that are fed manually, are similar in construction and operation to those described above, and involve the same hazards. There is an additional danger that if a part of the body is caught by a turning auger, amputation is almost unavoidable.</p></li>
<li><p>Persons under 16 may move the crop to the person feeding the machine and remove the finished product from the area; they may load and unload material from other types of conveyors, such as belt, bucket, or chain.</p></li>
<li><p>The unloading of a bulk body truck, including machines with self-unloading bulk boxes, meets the description of this Ag H.O. and is prohibited for minors under age 16. However, the operation of a potato bin piler is permitted for minors under 16 years of age working on farms.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Power post-hole digger, power post-driver, or nonwalking type rotary tiller.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The hazard of the post-hole digger is the danger of becoming entangled with the rotating drive. The hazard with the power post-hole driver, is a possibility of being struck by the descending ram.</p></li>
<li><p>Persons under 16 may set posts in holes, tamp the earth, attach and stretch wire, install gates, and repair fences.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Operating or assisting to operate (including starting, stopping, adjusting, feeding, or any other activity involving physical contact associated with the operation) any of the following machines:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Trencher or earthmoving equipment. The hazards of earthmoving or trenching equipment are entanglement with moving parts and falling under a moving piece of equipment.</p></li>
<li><p>Forklift. Forklifts have a double hazard of falling loads and overturning. They also accidentally may be driven over the edge of platforms.</p></li>
<li><p>Potato combine</p></li>
<li><p>Power-driven circular, band, or chain saw. The chief hazards in connection with saws are the danger of amputation and severe cuts from contact with the cutting edge.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Working on a farm in a yard, pen, or stall occupied by a bull, boar, or stud horse maintained for breeding purposes or a sow with suckling pigs, or cow with newborn calf (with umbilical cord present):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li><p>Working from a ladder or scaffold (painting, repairing, or building structures, pruning trees, picking fruit, etc., at a height of over twenty feet:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Many severe injuries occur when work is done from a ladder or scaffold at a considerable height.</p></li>
<li><p>This section does not prohibit using ladders to reach a work site above twenty feet, as long as the work is not done from a ladder or scaffold.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Driving a bus, truck, or automobile when transporting passengers, or riding on a tractor as a passenger or helper:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Exposure to traffic while moving at considerable speed makes driving a motor vehicle on a public road or highway hazardous. The additional responsibility of carrying passengers makes such driving unsuitable for minors under 16 years of age.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, most states will not issue a driver&#x2019;s license for a youth under 16 years of age.</p></li>
<li><p>Minors under 16 may drive a truck or automobile on the farm itself. However, they may not ride on any tractor or serve as a helper on any tractor.</p></li>

<li><p>Working inside:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>A fruit, forage, or grain storage designed to retain an oxygen deficient or toxic atmosphere,</p></li>
<li><p>An upright silo within two weeks after silage has been added or when a top unloading device is in operating position,</p></li>
<li><p>A manure pit, or</p></li>
<li><p>A horizontal silo while operating a tractor for packing purposes.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When oxygen is replaced by another gas or consumed by fermentation, anyone entering these storage areas is in danger of asphyxiation.</p></li>
<li><p>If the top unloading device is in operating position in the silo, a person may become entangled in its cutting and tearing mechanism and be seriously injured.</p></li>
<li><p>Employees under 16 may work inside the non-gas-tight type silo while the unloading device is in a raised position, and they may also operate this device from outside the silo.</p></li>
<li><p>The hazard involved in operating a tractor for packing purposes in a horizontal silo is the danger of overturning.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Handling or applying (including cleaning or decontaminating equipment, disposal or return of empty containers, or serving a s flagman for aircraft applying) agricultural chemicals classified under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7&#xA0;U.S.C. 135 et seq.) as Category&#xA0;I of toxicity, identified by the word &#x201C;poison&#x201D; and the &#x201C;skull and crossbones&#x201D; on the label or Category II of toxicity, identified by the word &#x201C;warning&#x201D; on the label:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Many agricultural chemicals present serious health hazards. Some have a corrosive effect on body tissue. Some affect the central nervous system, causing respiratory failures and many cause death by the accumulation of even minute quantities over a prolonged period.</p></li>
<li><p>The hazards involved in the job of flagman are that the employee must stand in the line of the flight to direct the pilot and also because of the possibility of contamination from the chemicals being applied.</p></li>
<li><p>Minors under 16 may handle and apply fertilizers or chemicals that are not labeled as indicated by this AG H.O.</p></li>

Under this authority, the Secretary has issued 17 Hazardous Occupations Orders (HOs).</p></li>
<li><p>The HOs specifically cover 16- and 17-year-old minors. But minors under 16 years of age are also banned from performing any of the occupations prohibited by the HOs because of CL Reg 3 (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.33'>29 CFR 570.33(b)</a>).</p></li>

The process culminated with the issuance of a report that detailed the hazards involved and actually presented the HO. The reports established the range and scope of each HO, coverage, and any exclusions and exemptions. These reports still remain the basis for opinions issued under each of the original HOs, although subsequent amendments to the HOs have expanded their scope.</p></li>
<li><p>Recent changes to individual HOs have resulted from such things as legislation, stakeholder input, academic studies, and WHD enforcement experiences. Detailed information concerning these changes are provided in the preambles of the Federal Register publications issued during rulemaking.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The procedure used to establish the HOs (found in Child Labor Regulation No. 5, previously incorporated in subpart D of <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.41'>29 CFR 570.41</a> through 570.49) preceded the enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). On April 17, 1995, the Department published a notice in the Federal Register (60 FR 19336), which deleted subpart D; consequently, any amendments to existing HOs or creation of new HOs must now follow the procedures established by the APA.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>The HOs, with the exception of HO 16 and HO 17, were issued before enactment of the 1961 and 1966 FLSA Amendments which brought many previously uncovered establishments under the provisions of the Act (retail, construction, state and local governments). Most of the original reports establishing the HOs did not address retail operations because of the limited FLSA coverage, however, many of the HOs have since been amended to address their application to retail operations.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Other HOs address only families of machines or specific acts. In some instances, many machines common to an industry are prohibited. These include:</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>HO 2 &#x2014;Motor Vehicle Occupations,</p>
<p>HO 5 &#x2014;Power-Driven Woodworking Machines,</p>
<p>HO 6 &#x2014;Exposure to Radioactive Substances and Ionizing Radiation, and</p>
<p>HO 12&#x2014;Balers, Compactors, and Power-Driven Paper Products Machines.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>A few of the HO prohibitions are so broad in scope that they include not only the machines used in the industry at the time the report was issued but any similar machines developed after the issuance of the HO. For example, the ban on woodworking machines (HO 5) includes all computerized woodworking machines, and the ban on high-lift trucks (HO 7) includes all types and uses of such trucks, whether specifically identified or not.</p></li>
<li><p>There are separate Hazardous Occupations Orders covering agricultural work (AG H.O.) which prohibit minors under age 16 from performing certain tasks on farms. These are discussed and defined in subpart E-1 of <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.'>29 CFR part 570.</a> Agricultural work activities must be separated from nonagricultural activities so that the appropriate child labor standard is applied.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to reduce confusion, the scope of each HO is discussed separately in the sections covering the individual HOs (see FOH 33g05 and 33h).</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="g04.-special-purposes-of-ho-14."><strong>33g04. Special purposes of HO 14.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The report establishing HO 14 considered the general safety of work associated with circular saws, band saws and guillotine shears. The report found that the operation of this equipment is hazardous wherever used, and that setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and cleaning of these machines are also hazardous. This led WH to review the scope of other HOs and it was determined that only HO&#xA0;5 specifically prohibited these ancillary activities. Accordingly, HOs 8, 10, 11 and 12 were revised to prohibit minors from setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and cleaning the machines prohibited by those HOs.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 14 serves as a &#x201C;catch-all&#x201D; HO. It prohibits minors from operating circular saws, band saws guillotine shears, chain saws, wood chippers, abrasive cutting discs, and reciprocating saws in any employment situation where this machinery is not prohibited by any of the other HOs. This is discussed further in the Scope of HO 14 (see FOH&#xA0;33h14(a)).</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="g05.-hos-are-mutually-exclusive."><strong>33g05. HOs are mutually exclusive.</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The HOs are designed to be mutually exclusive. Certain machines, however, may fall under different HOs at different times because their functions can vary, as when different attachments are used. For example, a dough mixer prohibited under HO 11 would be prohibited under HO 10 if a meat grinding attachment were added to make hamburger. Likewise, there may be situations when the illegal employment of a youth will fall under several HOs (e.g., the employment of a 16-year-old youth in a coal mine, while using a circular saw, would constitute a violation of HO 3 and HO 14).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="g06.-apprentices-and-student-learners."><strong>33g06. Apprentices and student-learners.</strong></h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>HOs 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17 contain limited exemptions for apprentices and student-learners provided they are employed under certain conditions (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.50'>29 CFR 570.50</a>). None of these limited exemptions, however, permit apprentices or student-learners to drive motor-vehicles as part of their training programs.</p></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Apprentices</h4>. The provisions of the HOs listed in (a) above do not apply to the employment of apprentices provided:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>the apprentice is employed in a craft recognized as an apprenticeable trade (the Office of Apprenticeship (OA), part of the Employment Training Administration can provide guidance),</p></li>
<li><p>the work of the apprentice in the hazardous occupation is incidental to the apprentice training, is intermittent and for short periods of time, and under the direct and close supervision of a journey worker, and</p></li>
<li><p>the apprentice is registered by OA (or a state agency approved by OA) or is employed under a written apprenticeship agreement which conforms to federal or state standards as determined by the Secretary of Labor.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Student-Learners </h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The provisions of the HOs listed in (a) above do not apply to the employment of a student-learner enrolled in a course of study and training in a cooperative vocational training program under a recognized state or local educational authority or in a course of study in a substantially similar program conducted by a private school, provided that the student-learner is employed under a written agreement which provides:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>That the work of the student-learner in the occupation declared particularly hazardous shall be incidental to the training,</p></li>
<li><p>That such work shall be intermittent and for short periods of time, and under the direct and close supervision of a qualified and experienced person,</p></li>
<li><p>That safety instruction shall be given by the school and correlated by the employer with on-the-job training, and</p></li>
<li><p>That a schedule of organized and progressive work processes to be performed on the job shall have been prepared.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The student-learner discussed in this section can be (and usually is) different from those student-learners for whom an employer may obtain a certificate to pay a subminimum wage under 29&#xA0;CFR part 520. An employer does not have to obtain the special certificate that allows him or her to employ student-learners at wages less than the minimum wage in order to take advantage of this limited exemption from certain HOs.</p></li>
<li><p>WH considers a Jobs Corps training program to be equivalent to &#x201C;a course of study in a substantially similar program conducted by a private school&#x201D; under 29&#xA0;CFR&#xA0;570.50(c)(1) and employers of Job Corps enrollees could take advantage of the limited exemption for student-learners if all the other conditions listed in&#xA0;29&#xA0;CFR&#xA0;570.50(c) are met.</p></li>
<li><p>A high school graduate may be employed in an occupation in which he or she has successfully completed training as a student-learner without the restrictions imposed by 29 CFR&#xA0;570.50(c)(1) and (2), even though he or she is not yet 18 years of age. Such minors must be employed in compliance with the all the remaining child labor provisions (the remaining HOs that do not have student learner exemptions). Merely graduating from high school is not sufficient to trigger this limited exemption from the student-learner provisions; the minor must also have successfully completed the appropriate vocational training.</p></li>
<li><p>The student-learner exemption is not limited to the school term but applies during the summer vacation provided all the terms of the exemption are met (see 29&#xA0;CFR&#xA0;570.50(c)). The required &#x201C;direct and close supervision&#x201D; and safety instructions will ordinarily be provided by the coordinator or an appropriate school official during the summer months. It is also necessary to establish that the student plans to be enrolled in a bona fide vocational education program the term following the vacation period.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The following definitions, applicable to the limited exemption from certain HOs, were discussed in detail in the preamble of the April 17, 2007 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (see 72 FR 19328, 19332).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The terms intermittent and short periods of time are not defined in the regulations and determinations concerning the employment of each apprentice and student-learner are made on a case-by-case basis after reviewing all the facts of the particular situation. The following items will be considered when making such determinations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>An apprentice or student-learner may not be the principal operator of prohibited machinery. He or she must work under the close supervision of a fully qualified and experienced adult, such as a journey-level worker in the case of an apprentice.</p></li>
<li><p>The duties assigned the minor may not be such that he or she is constantly operating the prohibited machinery during the work shift, but may only do so when required by the training experience. This precludes an apprentice or student-learner from being a production worker responsible for spending a significant proportion of the workday performing prohibited work.</p></li>
<li><p>While no universal time line may be imposed, the continuous performance of otherwise prohibited work (operating prohibited machinery) for more than one hour in a workday is more than intermittent and more than for a &#x201C;short period of time.&#x201D; The performance of otherwise prohibited work throughout a work shift which totals more than 20% of the apprentice&#x2019;s or student-learner&#x2019;s work shift is also more than for a &#x201C;short period of time.&#x201D;</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The term direct and close supervision is not defined in the regulations. Apprenticeship agreements registered with OA or OA-approved state agencies, however, do establish ratios concerning the number of journey workers and apprentices that may be on the job site at any one time. These ratios help ensure worker safety and that the apprentices receive both proper training and supervision. According to OA, the most widely used ratio is one apprentice for the first journey level worker on-site and one apprentice for every three additional journey workers thereafter. For the purpose of the limited exemption contained in 29&#xA0;CFR&#xA0;570.50, the requirement of direct and close supervision is met when there is one journey worker or experienced adult working with the first apprentice or student-learner on-site, and at least three journey workers or experienced adults working along side each additional apprentice or student-learner. The requirement for direct and close supervision only applies during the periods when the apprentice or student-learner is actually performing the otherwise prohibited work.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Scope of HO 1</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Workers in plants or establishments manufacturing or storing explosives, including articles containing explosive components, are especially subject to accident from explosions despite the progress made by manufacturers and OSHA in developing safeguards. The finding of the original investigation accompanying the report was that the accident severity rate for explosive manufacturing was about twice as great as the average for all manufacturing industries in 1936. The injuries resulting from such explosions are often serious, resulting in fatalities or permanent injuries.</p></li>
<li><p>This order deals with occupations in plants or establishments engaged in manufacturing, handling, storing, and transporting of explosives, articles containing explosive components, small arms ammunition, blasting caps and primers. This includes fireworks (see FOH&#xA0;33h01(a)(4)a for the definitions of the terms explosives and articles containing explosive components).</p></li>
<li><p>The order does not apply to the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Retail stores, including the storage of ammunition in gun shops, sporting goods stores, building supplies and hardware stores; retail fireworks stands; and other retail establishments.</p></li>
<li><p>Gun clubs, trap and skeet ranges, turkey shoots, certain armories, police stations and other such areas where only small arms ammunition is being stored.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of explosives in mining operations is covered by HOs 3 and 9. The use of explosives in demolition and ship-breaking work is covered by HO 15. The use of explosives in excavation work is covered by HO 17. Storage of explosives at such sites, however, is covered under HO 1.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Definitions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The terms explosives and articles containing explosive components mean and include ammunition, black powder, blasting caps, fireworks, high explosives, primers, smokeless powder, and explosives and explosive materials as defined in <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/841'>18 U.S.C. 841(c)</a>-(f) and the implementing regulations at <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/27/555.'>27 CFR part 555.</a> The terms include any chemical compound, mixture, or device, the primary or common purpose of which is to function by explosion, as well as all goods identified in the most recent list of explosive materials published by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, Department of Justice. This list is not intended to be all-inclusive and is updated and published annually in the Federal Register pursuant to <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/841'>18 U.S.C. 841(d)</a>. A copy of the most recent version of the list may be found through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosive&#x2019;s Website located at <a href="http://www.atf.gov">www.atf.gov</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The term plant or establishment manufacturing or storing explosives or articles containing explosive components means the land with all the buildings and other structures thereon used in connection with the manufacturing or processing or storing of explosives or articles containing explosive components. Types of establishments which may store these materials include ammunition depots, dynamite magazines, bunkers, armories, and fireworks warehouses.</p></li>
<li><p>The term nonexplosives areas as used in the exception in HO 1 are those which meet all four criteria found in <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.51'>29 CFR 570.51(b)(3)</a> and listed below (the criteria are such that ordinarily only areas in large plants or establishments could qualify &#x2013; a small fireworks plant or establishment would not ordinarily cover such a large area that it could sustain a &#x201C;nonexplosives area&#x201D;):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>None of the work performed in the area involves the handling or use of explosives.</p></li>
<li><p>The area is separated from the explosives area by a distance not less than that prescribed in the American Table of Distances for the protection of inhabited buildings. The American Table of Distances, published by the Institute of Makers of Explosives, was last revised in 1991. The table lists &#x201C;minimum safe distances&#x201D; for the location of explosive storage and manufacturing buildings from inhabited buildings, railways, highways, etc. These distances vary with the type and amount of explosive materials.</p></li>
<li><p>The area is separated from the explosives area by a fence or is otherwise located so that it constitutes a definite designated area. The phrase &#x201C;or is otherwise located so that is constitutes a definite designated area&#x201D; was included to bring in any area which is located at a great distance from the explosives area, or is on the other side of a natural barricade at least comparable to a fence.</p></li>
<li><p>Satisfactory controls have been established to prevent employees under 18 years of age within the area from entering any area in or about the plant that does not meet the above three criteria. The painting of a warning on the doors of all buildings containing explosives advising minors under 18 years of age to stay out does not satisfy this requirement. Such warnings would have no actual restraining effect on employees under 18 years of age and, by themselves, would not constitute a satisfactory control within the intent of <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.51'>29 CFR 570.51(b)(3)</a>.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>HO 1 applies to homeworkers engaged in the manufacture of fireworks in their own homes. Since explosives are stored in the home prior to and after assembly, a homeworker&#x2019;s home would meet the definition of a &#x201C;plant or establishment manufacturing or storing explosives.&#x201D;</p></li>
<li><p>HO 1 applies to &#x201C;shooters&#x201D; who are hired by various civic organizations and governments to transport fireworks from the manufacturer or wholesaler to the display site, set up the fireworks at the site, load mortars (tubes from which the shells are fired), and fire shells. Fireworks must be temporarily stored at the site prior to the display.

</ol></li>
<li><p>Work which involves the storage of ammunition and/or explosives.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>HO 1 applies to any establishment, other than a retail establishment, which stores ammunition (other than small-arms ammunition not exceeding .60 caliber) or explosives, regardless of whether or not manufacturing takes place at the facility.</p></li>
<li><p>Minors 16 and 17 years of age, however, could work in a &#x201C;nonexplosives area&#x201D; of such an establishment or at an establishment where only small-arms ammunition was stored.

<blockquote>
<p>Name: Occupations of Motor-vehicle Driver and Outside Helper</p>

<h1 id="originally-adopted-january-1-1940">Originally Adopted: January 1, 1940</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Scope of HO 2 </h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Driving a motor vehicle involves a high degree of accident risk for persons of all ages, and is particularly hazardous for minors between the ages of 16 and 18 due to their lack of experience. Despite the prohibitions of HO 2, transportation-related deaths, largely highway incidents, remained the most frequently recorded cause of occupational deaths of 16- and 17-year-olds between 1980 and 2007. HO 2 applies to all employers subject to the nonagricultural CL provisions of the FLSA and, with a limited statutory exception, specifically prohibits the employment of persons under the age of 18 as motor-vehicle operators and as &#x201C;outside helpers&#x201D; on any public road, highway and in or about any mine (including open pit mine or quarry), place where logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any excavation covered by HO 17. However, driving on private property (other than described above) is permitted. These provisions apply whether the employee is driving a personal or business owned-vehicle.</p></li>
<li><p>The Drive for Teen Employment Act, effective October 31, 1998, amended the FLSA by creating &#xA7; 13(c)(6) and established the conditions under which 17-year-olds (but not those under 17 years of age) may drive certain automobiles and trucks on the job.</p></li>
<li><p>Definitions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The term motor vehicle shall mean any automobile, truck, truck-tractor, trailer, semi-trailer, motorcycle, or similar vehicle propelled or drawn by mechanical power and designed for use as a means of transportation but shall not include any vehicle operated exclusively on rails.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The above definition is not dependent upon the source of energy &#x2013; vehicles may be propelled by gasoline, propane, electricity, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>This definition does not require that the motor vehicle be licensed or outfitted with special equipment, nor is the size of the vehicle a factor. Golf carts, all terrain vehicles (ATVs), and riding mowers designed or used as a means of transportation, meet the definition of &#x201C;motor vehicles&#x201D; and fall within the scope of HO 2 when operated on any public road or highway (see 75 FR 28409).</p></li>
<li><p>The term &#x201C;similar vehicle&#x201D; includes buses, vans, mopeds, pickup trucks, panel trucks, recreational vehicles, ice-cream and chuck-wagon-type trucks, motorized trail bikes, jeeps, and other all terrain vehicles.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The term driver shall mean any individual who, in the course of employment, drives a motor vehicle at any time.</p></li>
<li><p>The term outside helper shall mean any individual, other than a driver, whose work includes riding on a motor vehicle outside the cab for the purpose of assisting in transporting or delivering goods.</p></li>
<li><p>The term gross vehicle weight includes the truck chassis with lubricants, water and a full tank or tanks of fuel, plus the weight of the cab or driver&#x2019;s compartment, body and special chassis and body equipment, and payload.</p></li>
<li><p>The term occasional and incidental driving is now defined in the FLSA as driving that involves no more than one-third of the worktime in any work day and no more than 20 percent of the worktime in any workweek.</p></li>
<li><p>The term urgent, time-sensitive deliveries means trips which, because of such factors as customer satisfaction, the rapid deterioration of the quality or change in temperature of the product, and/or economic incentives, are subject to time-lines, schedules, and/or turn around times which might impel the driver to hurry in the completion of the delivery. Prohibited trips would include, but are not limited to, the delivery of pizzas and prepared foods to the customers; the delivery of materials under a deadline (such as deposits to a bank at closing, or parts to a job site for the completion of an emergency repair job); and the shuttling of passengers to and from transportation depots to meet transport schedules. Urgent, time sensitive deliveries do not depend on the delivery&#x2019;s points of origin and termination, and include the delivery of people and things to the employer&#x2019;s place of business as well as from that business to some other location.</p></li>
<li><p>To define the term public road, WHD uses the generally accepted definition of a public road as &#x201C;a road or way established and adopted (or accepted as a dedication) by the proper authorities for the use of the general public, and over which every person has a right to pass and to use it for all purposes of travel or transportation to which it is adapted and devoted. The proper test in determining whether [a] road is a &#x2018;public&#x2019; or &#x2018;private road&#x2019; is [the] use to which such roadway is put, and [the] fact that [the] road has been constructed at public expense is not conclusive&#x201D; (Bush &amp; Burchett, Inc. v. Reich, 117 F.3d 932, 938 n. 11 (6<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1997), citing Black&apos;s Law Dictionary 1329 (6<sup>th</sup> ed. 1990)). Under this standard, a pathway or road in or at the perimeter of a City park would not be considered a public road, if it is used only by pedestrians, bicyclists, golf carts, and similar traffic to access parts of the park grounds for recreational purposes. But if the pathway or road is used by automobiles or trucks to traverse the park or to access park facilities for purposes such as delivery of goods, then it would be considered a public road.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Occupations PROHIBITED</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Driving any type of motor vehicle on public roads or highways and in or about any mine (including open pit mine or quarry), place where logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any excavation covered by HO 17, except as authorized by &#xA7;&#xA0;13(c)(6).</p></li>
<li><p>Riding outside the cab of a vehicle as an outside helper.</p></li>
<li><p>Towing of any vehicles.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY BANNED</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may operate motor vehicles on private property other than any mine (including open pit mine or quarry), place where logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any excavation covered by HO 17.</p></li>
<li><p>Other motorized vehicles to which HO 2 does not apply</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>HO 2 does not apply to self-propelled vehicles that are designed to perform work as distinguished from being used &#x201C;as a means of transportation.&#x201D; This includes certain types of riding mowers, farm tractors, bulldozers, road scrapers, and other vehicles not suitable for travel on public streets, geared only for off-the-road use, and only designed for use on construction sites, grassy areas and along walk paths. When it is necessary to move such vehicles any distance, they are generally loaded on a lowboy-type flatbed trailer and transported from job site to job site. Some of these vehicles, however, may be prohibited under HO 17 when used in excavation. Note: See &#x201C;Enforcement positions&#x201D; (FOH&#xA0;33h02(e)(3)) regarding riding mowers and golf carts that must cross public roads to complete a work assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Trucks that have equipment permanently mounted on them (such as mobile drilling rigs) or equipment that has its own built-in means of transport are considered motor vehicles under HO&#xA0;2 and fall under the prohibitions of the HO when operated on public roads. Some of these trucks and pieces of equipment can travel at speeds in excess of 30 miles per hour.</p></li>
<li><p>Certain electric carts are used as a means of transportation in large industrial plants, and at railroad stations and airport terminals. Generally, such vehicles are outside the scope of HO 2 unless employees use these vehicles as a means of transportation on a public street. Thus, 16- and 17-year-old minors may operate motorized vehicles such as riding mowers or golf carts as long as they are not driven on public roads.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Exemptions</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>HO 2 does not contain an exemption for apprentices or student-learners. Furthermore, none of the limited exemptions applicable to HOs 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17 permit apprentices or student-learners to drive motor-vehicles as part of their training programs.</p></li>
<li><p>Occasional and incidental driving by 17-year-olds. The Drive for Teen Employment Act, enacted on October 31, 1998, amended the FLSA to permit 17-year-olds (but not those under 17 years of age) to drive automobiles and trucks as part of their employment if all of the following criteria are met:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The automobile or truck does not exceed 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight,</p></li>
<li><p>The driving is restricted to daylight hours,</p></li>
<li><p>The minor holds a state license valid for the type of driving involved in the job performed,</p></li>
<li><p>The minor has successfully completed a state approved driver education course,</p></li>
<li><p>The minor has no records of any moving violation at the time of hire,</p></li>
<li><p>The vehicle is equipped with a seat belt for the driver and any passengers and the employer has instructed the youth that the seat belts must be used when driving the vehicle,</p></li>
<li><p>The driving does not involve:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Towing vehicles,</p></li>
<li><p>Route deliveries or route sales,</p></li>
<li><p>Transportation for hire of property, goods, or passengers,</p></li>
<li><p>Urgent, time sensitive-deliveries,</p></li>
<li><p>Transporting more than 3 passengers, including employees of the employer,</p></li>
<li><p>Driving beyond a 30 mile radius from the minor&#x2019;s place of employment,</p></li>
<li><p>More than two trips away from the primary place of employment in any single day to deliver the employer&#x2019;s goods to a customer (other than urgent, time-sensitive deliveries which are prohibited), or</p></li>
<li><p>More than two trips away from the primary place of employment in any single day to transport passengers, other than employees of the employer, and</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Such driving is only occasional and incidental to the minor&#x2019;s employment. This means that the youth may spend no more than one-third of the worktime in any workday and no more than 20 percent of the worktime in any workweek driving.</p></li>

<li><p>Ambulance attendants</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Minors 16 and 17 years of age who have completed the necessary training as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and are employed as qualified ambulance attendants are not &#x201C;outside helpers&#x201D; within the meaning of HO 2 and may ride in the rear of the ambulance while attending the patient being transported.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Cart caddy</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The operation of battery operated &#x201C;cart caddy&#x201D; machines used by grocery stores to move large strings of shopping carts back to the front area of the store would be a permissible occupation for minors 16 and 17 years of age. This machine is not considered a &#x201C;motor vehicle&#x201D; and does not fall within the scope of HO 2. However, as it is a power-driven machine, its use by 14- and 15-year-olds is prohibited under CL Reg 3.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Golf carts and riding mowers</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Golf carts, riding mowers, and similar motorized vehicles fall within the scope of HO 2 if used as a means of transportation on public roads. Because these motorized vehicles are not &#x201C;automobiles or trucks, operation of such vehicles would not fall under the limited exemption contained in FLSA &#xA7;&#xA0;13(c)(6).</p></li>
<li><p>There are certain situations where a public road traverses a golf course or other establishments where motorized vehicles are used off the roadway. It may be necessary for golf carts, riding mowers, or other motorized vehicles to cross the public road in order to reach a particular work site or return to the club house. Although a strict interpretation of HO 2 would prohibit those under 18 years of age from driving the carts and mowers across public roads, WH will not assert a violation of HO 2 if the contact with the public road involves only the crossing of that road, and such crossings occur only at marked cross walks and pathways.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Messengers</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may, under certain conditions, be employed as messengers and errand boys/girls by firms other than public messenger services to pick up and deliver messages or packages in passenger type vehicles operated by someone other than the minor (see FOH 33c(19)(b), see also &#xA7; 570.34(o)).</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Scope of HO 3</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The report that established HO 3 found accident rates (including death and dismemberment) for adults employed in and about coal mines far exceed accident rates in other industries. This report did not address long term occupational illnesses such as &#x201C;black lung.&#x201D; As of the last census before the report was issued (1930), three per cent of workers employed in coal mines were under the age of eighteen (approximately 16,000 minors). Typically, if employed underground, the young people worked as &#x201C;miner&#x2019;s helpers&#x201D; loading coal, or as &#x201C;trappers&#x201D; or &#x201C;door boys&#x201D; opening and closing doors (regulating air flow) to allow the passage of coal cars. If employed above ground, they worked as slate pickers, as helpers in repair shops, or in general clean up work. The report concluded that the risk of injury to youths employed in coal mines was great due to the rate of accidents involving adults, and due to their lack of experience and good judgment.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 3 is industry specific. Its scope includes all types of work performed in or about an underground mine, an open-pit (strip) mine, or at the surface part of the mining plant that contributes to the extraction, grading, cleaning, or other handling of coal.

<p>Name: Forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention occupations, timber tract occupations, forestry service occupations, logging occupations, and occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock mill.</p>
<p>Originally Adopted: August 1, 1941</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Scope of HO 4</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The many accidents and injuries in logging made it the most hazardous manufacturing industry at the time of the original order. Sawmilling ranked second. This was based on both the frequency with which accidents occurred as well as the severity of the resulting injuries. A December 1994 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Alert &#x2013; Request for Assistance in Preventing Injuries and Deaths of Loggers &#x2013; confirmed the earlier finding of the risks involved in logging. During the period from 1980-1989, the National Traumatic Occupational Fatalities Surveillance System reported 1,492 deaths of workers in the logging industry, resulting in an annual fatality rate more than 20 times that for all workers (164 deaths per 100,000 workers compared with 7 per 100,000 for all workers). Most of these deaths occurred in four occupational groups: logging occupations (for example, fellers, limbers, buckers, and choker setters), truck drivers, general laborers, and material machine operators.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 4 prohibits, with a few exceptions, the performance of all occupations in the logging industry, in sawmills, lath mills, and cooperage-stock mills. HO 4 was amended several times and new sections were added during World War II (on September 11, 1942, and June 24, 1943), to permit the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds in saw filing and certain occupations in logging for the duration of the war and six months afterwards.</p></li>
<li><p>On February 2, 1948, and again on April 15, 1967, HO 4 was revised to permit 16- and 17-year-olds to perform specific tasks in logging, logging camps, and outside shake and shingle mills.</p></li>
<li><p>The Department of Labor Appropriations Act, 2004 (PL 108-199) amended the FLSA by creating a limited exemption from the child labor provisions for minors 14 to 18 years of age who are excused from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The exemption, contained in &#xA7; 13(c)(7) of the FLSA, allows eligible youth to be employed by businesses that use machinery to process wood products, but does not allow such youth to operate or assist in operating power-driven woodworking machines.</p></li>
<li><p>The provisions of FLSA &#xA7; 13(c)(7) impact CL Reg 3 (see FOH&#xA0;33c01) and HO 4 (see FOH&#xA0;33h04(d)). A Final Rule was published on May 20, 2010 (see 75 FR 28404) that incorporated the provisions of the amended &#xA7; 13(c)(7) by revising subparts C and E of <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.'>29 CFR part 570.</a></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The 2010 Final Rule (see 75 FR 28429) also expanded HO 4 to prohibit most work in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention, timber tract occupations, and forestry service operations (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.54'>29 CFR 570.54</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Definitions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>the term all occupations in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention shall include the controlling and extinguishing of fires, the wetting down of areas or extinguishing of spot fires, and the patrolling of burned areas to assure the fire has been extinguished. The term shall also include the following tasks when performed in conjunction with, or in support of, efforts to extinguish a forest fire: the piling and burning of slash; the clearing of fire trails or roads; the construction, maintenance, and patrolling of fire lines; acting as a fire lookout or fire patrolman; and the maintaining of fire fighting equipment. The prohibition against the employment of youth in forest fire fighting and fire prevention applies to all forest and timber tract locations, logging operations, and sawmill operations, including all buildings located within such areas.</p></li>
<li><p>The term all occupations in forestry services shall mean all work involved in the support of timber production, wood technology, forestry economics and marketing, and forest protection. The term includes such services as timber cruising, surveying, or logging-engineering parties; estimating timber; timber valuation; forest pest control; forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention as defined in this section; and reforestation. The term shall not include work in forest nurseries, establishments primarily engaged in growing trees for purposes of reforestation. The term shall not include the gathering of forest products such as balsam needles, ginseng, huckleberry greens, maple sap, moss, Spanish moss, sphagnum moss, teaberries, and tree seeds; the distillation of gum, turpentine, and rosin if carried on at the gum farm; and the extraction of pine gum.</p></li>
<li><p>The term all occupations in logging shall mean all work performed in conjunction with the felling of timber; the bucking or converting of timber into logs, poles, piles, ties, bolts, pulpwood, chemical wood, excelsior wood, cordwood, fence posts, or similar products; the collecting, skidding, yarding, loading, transporting and unloading of such products in connection with logging; the constructing, repairing and maintaining of roads, railroads, flumes, or camps used in connection with logging; and other work performed in connection with logging.</p></li>
<li><p>The term all occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage-stock mill shall mean all work performed in or about any such mill in connection with storing of logs and bolts; converting logs or bolts into sawn lumber, laths, shingles, or cooperage stock, or other products of such mills; and other work performed in connection with the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage-stock mill. The term shall not include work performed in the planing-mill department or other remanufacturing departments of any sawmill, or in any planing-mill or remanufacturing plant not a part of a sawmill (This work could be prohibited under HO 5 if the minor operated power-driven wood working machines).</p></li>
<li><p>The term all occupations in timber tracts means all work performed in or about establishments that cultivate, manage or sell standing timber. The term includes work performed in timber culture, timber tracts, timber-stand improvement, and forest fire fighting and fire prevention. It includes work on tree farms, except those tree farm establishments that meet the definition of agriculture contained in <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/203'>29 U.S.C. 203(f)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The terms remanufacturing plant and remanufacturing departments as used in (d) above refer to those manufacturing departments of a sawmill where lumber products such as boxes, lawn furniture, and the like are re-manufactured from previously cut lumber. The kind of work performed in a remanufacturing plant or department is similar to that done in the planing-mill department in that rough lumber is surfaced or made into other finished products. The term is not intended to denote those operations in a sawmill where rough lumber is cut to dimensions. The mere cutting of rough wood into smaller size pieces would not constitute remanufacturing under HO 4.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>There is no provision in HO 4 for apprentices or student-learners. The logging section of the order was reviewed in 1974 in response to a request for a student-learner exemption in logging operations. It was determined that the industry had not substantially changed, the hazards remained the same, and the request was denied.</p></li>
<li><p>FLSA &#xA7; 13(c)(7) &#x2013; Employment of Certain Minors in Places of Business That Use Machinery to Process Wood Products.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The Department of Labor Appropriations Act of 2004 amended the FLSA by creating a limited exemption from the child labor provisions for certain minors 14 to 18 years old which allows them to be employed inside and outside places of businesses that use machinery to process wood products (such as sawmills, furniture manufacturers, cabinet makers, garden shed and gazebo manufacturers, and pallet shops).</p></li>
<li><p>With regard to such establishments, this amendment overrides the general CL Reg 3 prohibitions regarding the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing occupations, processing occupations, and in work places where goods are manufactured or processed. It also overrides the HO 4 prohibition regarding the employment of youth in occupations that entail entering the sawmill building. This exemption, however, does not excuse compliance with the remaining CL Reg 3 occupations standards and all of the CL Reg 3 hours standards in regards to the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds; nor does it excuse compliance with the provisions of all of the other HOs in regards to the employment of youths aged 14 through 17 (see &#xA7;&#xA0;570.34(m)(2)).</p></li>
<li><p>Under this exemption, contained at FLSA &#xA7; 13(c)(7), an eligible youth is one who is under the age of 18 and at least the age of 14 who by statute or judicial order is exempt from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade. In addition, the youth must be supervised on the job by an adult relative or by an adult of the same religious sect or division as the youth.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>An adult is someone who has reached his or her eighteenth birthday.</p></li>
<li><p>A relative, for purposes of this exemption, includes at a minimum a parent or person standing in place of a parent, a grandparent, an aunt or uncle, or a sibling.</p></li>
<li><p>Such supervision must be close, direct, constant, and uninterrupted (see 29 CFR&#xA0;570.54(b)).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Such minors are still prohibited from operating or assisting in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines by virtue of &#xA7; 13(c)(7) and HO 5. Power-driven woodworking machines include all fixed or portable machines or tools driven by power and used or designed for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing, stapling, wire stitching, fastening or otherwise assembling, pressing or printing wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber (see FOH&#xA0;33h05(a)(5)a.).</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, the employer must ensure that the minors are protected from wood particles or other flying debris within the work place by a barrier appropriate to the potential hazard of such wood particles or flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient distance from machinery in operation. The minors must also use personal protective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive levels of noise and saw dust. Compliance with these provisions will be accomplished when the employer is in compliance with the requirements of the applicable governing standards issued by the U.S. Department of Labor&#x2019;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or, in those states where OSHA has authorized the state to operate its own Occupational Safety and Health Plan, the applicable standards issued by the Office charged with administering the State Occupations Safety and Health Plan.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Enforcement positions</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Veneer mills</p>
<p>Veneer mills expose minors to similar, if not identical, hazards that are present in sawmills &#x2013; saws, sharp blades, heavy logs, hoisting apparatus, cranes, forklifts, as well as dust and noise pollution. Veneer mills are treated the same as sawmills under HO 4.</p></li>
<li><p>Firewood</p>
<p>Cutting and splitting logs and the collecting, stacking, and loading of firewood are considered &#x201C;converting of timber into pulpwood, cordwood, or similar products&#x201D; and therefore this work is prohibited by HO 4 (see WHD Director A.W. Motley&apos;s letter of May 20, 1959). The prohibition against the employment of youth under 18 years of age to cut, split, collect, stack, and load firewood applies to all covered employment&#x2014;not just work in forestry, sawmilling, or logging.</p></li>
<li><p>Power-driven wood chipping machines</p>
<p>Occupations in connection with the operation of wood chipping machines when used in the woods in logging operations would be subject to the 18-year minimum age under both HO 4 and HO 14. Child labor violations involving wood chipping machines, in any nonagricultural occupation or industry, will be recorded as being a violation of HO 14.</p></li>
<li><p>Stump removal</p>
<p>Stump pulling using tractors in nonagricultural situations is not subject to HO 4.</p></li>
<li><p>Christmas trees</p>
<p>An ordinary household-sized Christmas tree is not considered to be timber, nor is it cut into log lengths or converted into lumber products&#x2014;therefore, HO 4 does not apply (see Director of Children&apos;s Bureau Industrial Division McConnell&apos;s letter of October 29, 1942).</p></li>
<li><p>Clearing right-of-way for power lines, highways</p>
<p>Activities in connection with the clearing of a right-of-way would not be within the scope of HO 4 since these are not logging operations. HO 4 does not cover the clearing of land in preparation for highway construction (see Regional Solicitor Barnes&apos; memorandum of June 25, 1959).</p></li>

<h4 id="h05.-hazardous-occupations-order-5power-driven-woodworking-machine-operations."><strong>33h05. HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 5&#x2014;Power-Driven Woodworking Machine Operations.</strong></h4>
<p>Name: Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven wood-working machines.</p>
<p>Originally Adopted: August 1, 1941</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Scope of HO 5</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Power-driven woodworking machines are among the most hazardous of all machine tools. Although great strides have been made by manufacturers and OSHA to improve the safety of such machines through design changes and guarding, the risk of injury to operators or workers assisting to operate such machines has not been eliminated. Several hazardous factors are inherent to woodworking machines&#x2014;extremely high speeds of operation, sharpness of cutting tools, and the lightness of material being cut making &#x201C;kick-backs&#x201D; possible. The fact that many woodworking machines are hand fed increases the hazards.</p></li>
<li><p>This order is very broad in scope and is applied on a machine basis. Basically, if a minor, while performing covered employment, is operating, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and/or cleaning a power-driven wood working machine, HO 5 most likely applies.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 5 does not apply when the machinery or tools are designed to be used, and are used exclusively, on materials other than wood&#x2014;such as metal, plastic or stone. Another HO (such as HO 8, 14, 16 or 17) may prohibit such work.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 5 applies in any industries where power-driven woodworking tools are used&#x2014;including furniture plants; sawmills, cabinet makers and other woodworking plants and shops; construction sites; packing sheds; retail and service establishments such as hardware and lumber stores; state and local government entities; and other industries which use power-driven woodworking machines, but which may not directly manufacture wood products. Even though FLSA &#xA7;&#xA0;13(c)(7) exempts certain minors 14 to 17 years of age from the HO 4 prohibition concerning the performance of work that entails entering a sawmill building, the HO 5 prohibitions regarding operating and assisting to operate power-driven woodworking machines are applicable to the employment of those youth who may now legally work in a sawmill.</p></li>
<li><p>Definitions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The term power-driven woodworking machine shall mean all fixed or portable machines or tools driven by power and used or designed for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing, stapling, wire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing, or printing wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber. This definition is broad and includes machines used at the time the order was issued as well as all power-driven woodworking machines developed in subsequent years.

<p>Name: Hazardous Occupations Order 6&#x2014;Exposure to Radioactive Substances and to Ionizing</p>
<p>Radiations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally Adopted: May 1, 1942</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Scope of HO 6</p></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Many deaths from radiation poisoning were reported in 1929. A number of these cases involved young women who were engaged in manufacturing luminous compounds. Their exposure to radiation began before they were 18 years of age. The hazards of radiation exposure have been found to be greater for young persons since they are less likely to exercise care to avoid contamination. Moreover, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Division of the National Institute of Science and Technology, several studies have shown that radiation exposure caused more injury to rapidly growing and dividing cells than to mature cells. The significant health risk connected with exposing young people to radiation is highlighted by the fact that OSHA has recognized this risk by making it its only age specific standard.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 6 was issued to protect people under the age of 18 from exposure to radiation in the workplace and it applies to manufacturing plants, storage facilities, hospitals, clinics, laboratories, dental offices, colleges and universities, and all other covered locations where there are X-ray machines or other sources of radiation contamination.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 6 was issued before the development of atomic energy as a weapon during World War II and later as an energy source. Consequently, HO 6 does not address problems related to exposure to atomic energy. Workers are protected from such hazards by regulations issued and enforced by the Department of Energy.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 6 adopted as its tolerance to the exposure to radioactive substance in the air the occupational standards established by the National Committee on Radiation Protection. This tolerance was set forth in the National Bureau of Standards Handbook No. 69 entitled: Maximum Permissible Body Burdens and Maximum Permissible Concentrations of Radionuclides in Air and in Water for Occupational Exposure. The rules on annual intake of radiation were changed in 1993, and the maximum permissible concentrations in the air for exposure have been replaced by what is known as the &#x201C;derived air concentration.&#x201D; These requirements, which do not apply to naturally formed radiation or to medical radiation, are found in <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/null'>10 CFR part 20</a>, Standards for Protection Against Radiation.</p></li>

With regard to thorium salts used to make incandescent gas mantles such as those used on Coleman Lanterns, this also is no longer an exposure problem.

<li><p>Scope of HO 7</p></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The investigation of occupations involved in the operation of hoisting apparatus was initiated because of the generally accepted belief that such equipment presented a high degree of accident risk and was inappropriate for young workers. Accidents have involved improper rigging where loads have fallen on people and crushed them; persons falling from stacked materials or down elevator shafts; and people coming into contact with over-head electrical conductors. These injuries not only occurred during the operation of the equipment, but also while assisting in the operation of hoisting apparatus.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 7 originally prohibited 16- and 17-year-olds from operating (or, in some cases assisting to operate) all power-driven hoisting apparatus which consist of elevators, cranes, derricks, hoists and high-lift trucks and portable elevators, and tiering or piling machines. HO 7 is broadly written and prohibits the operation of this equipment no matter where located.</p></li>
<li><p>Revisions to HO 7 in 2010 (see FOH 33h07(b); 75 FR 28433) more broadly prohibited 16- and 17-year-olds from operating, tending, riding upon, working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling such equipment.</p></li>

Iowa 2004), the District Court affirmed DOL&#x2019;s position that minors who operated a skid loader as a &#x201C;scraper&#x201D; to muck-out a cattle transport vehicle were still employed in violation of HO 7 even though they never raised or lowered the shovel (the hoisting apparatus) of the equipment. The court cited the administrative law judge&#x2019;s reasoning that &#x201C;although the minors testified that they did not lift the shovel of the skid loader to high levels in performing their duties, the fact that they had the opportunity to do so, either intentionally or unintentionally, by moving the levers, placed the minors and other minors in the area in a potentially hazardous position.&#x201D; (316 F.Supp.2nd at 800).</p></li>
<li><p>This same reasoning would prohibit minors from simply moving such power-driven hoisting equipment from one location to another, such as around a job site or from the back of an equipment dealer showroom to the front of the showroom.</p></li>

<li><p>Operation of amusement park rides</p></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The operation of amusement park rides is not prohibited by HO 7.</p></li>
<li><p>Although a number of rides in amusement and theme parks have characteristics similar to certain machines that minors under 18 years of age are prohibited from operating under HO 7, a careful review of these rides, which have a variety of names, has concluded that none of the machines are &#x201C;derricks<span id="OLE_LINK5" class="anchor"></span>&#x201D;, &#x201C;cranes&#x201D;, &#x201C;hoists&#x201D;, &#x201C;elevators&#x201D; or &#x201C;manlifts&#x201D; within the meaning of the HO.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Swing-type rides appear very similar to a stiff-leg derrick or various types of cranes including a jib crane. However, these rides only swing or rotate and lack any hoisting apparatus.</p></li>
<li><p>A number of roller coasters and similar rides are connected cars operated on a rail and driven by a chain pull. They are not operated by hoists, nor are they considered elevators or manlifts.</p></li>
<li><p>Water rides often follow the flow of the water down a trough and are repositioned at a higher level by a conveyor belt. Since the boats carrying the riders remain within the trough, these rides are not considered elevators or manlifts.</p></li>

Motorized hand trucks, such as the Yale Low Lift Pallet-Walkie Motorized Hand Truck, models MPW 040 and 060, are not considered to be &#x201C;high-lift trucks.&#x201D; Designed for transportation but not the tiering of materials, they are low-lift trucks and not subject to HO 7.</p></li>
<li><p>Hanglines in poultry processing plants and dry cleaners are considered to be &#x201C;chain conveyors&#x201D; and are not covered by HO 7. These apparatus do not have hoists to raise and lower the loads.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Hanglines in poultry processing plants are usually made up of a metal I-beam, a continuous chain, and shackles attached to the chain. The chain may be powered by an electric motor or other means and generally runs from the loading dock or platform, through the plant were the poultry is processed and back to the loading dock in a continuous loop. Crews on the platform (or sometimes in a darkened room nearby) attach the live poultry to the shackles by their feet where they hang upside down. The hangline then moves to the killing area within the plant and may in the course of its route rise or descend within the plant to different levels. The speed of the chain is coordinated with the loading crew&#x2019;s ability to hang a fowl on each shackle and not leave any without a bird on it. HO 11, as of July 19, 2010, prohibits the employment of youth under 18 in most occupations in or about poultry slaughtering and processing establishments.</p></li>
<li><p>Hanglines in dry cleaners that hold finished garments to be picked up operate in a similar manner as the hanglines in poultry processing plants.</p></li>

<li><p>The &#x201C;Cart Caddy&#x201D; and &#x201C;QuicKART&#x201D; are two types of machines often used by grocers and other retail stores to move large strings of shopping carts. These machines are hooked to the last shopping cart in a string and then the operator guides the string of carts back to the store while commanding the machine to move by means of a hand-held remote control. The operator walks behind the machine and operates the manual throttle when returning to the parking lot to collect more carts.</p></li>
<li><p>These machines do not fall within the definitions of any of the hoists prohibited by HO 7; nor are these machines considered to be &#x201C;motor vehicles&#x201D; as defined in HO 2. Sixteen- and 17-year-old minors are permitted to operate these machines.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the &#x201C;Cart Caddy&#x201D; and &#x201C;QuicKART&#x201D; are both power-driven machines, 29&#xA0;CFR 570.33(b) would prohibit 14- and 15-year-olds from operating or tending such machines (see FOH&#xA0;33c06(e)(5)).</p>

<li><p>A canister loader truck is a wheeled vehicle with a lifting device which moves baggage between the terminal and the aircraft. Baggage is placed in canisters which hold 50 to 70 bags and suitcases. The canisters are then pushed onto the bed of the loader which is equipped with rollers. The canisters are rolled onto the loader and are rolled off onto the plane. Most of the time this function is automated, however, sometimes hand loading and/or unloading of the canisters is required. The load is raised and lowered by hydraulics to and from the ground level to the cargo hold of the airplane. The reverse process takes place during the unloading of the plane. Canister loader trucks are high-lift trucks as defined in 29&#xA0;CFR&#xA0;570.58(b) and therefore HO 7 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from operating, loading and unloading such equipment.</p>

<li><p>WHD issued a Final Rule on May 20, 2010, which removed from HO 7 the exemption that allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to operate air or electric powered hoists that did not exceed a lift capacity of one ton (see 75 Fed. Reg. 28404, 28434 (May 20, 2010)). With the elimination of that exemption, minors under the age of 18 were prohibited from operating or assisting in operating all power-driven hoists in any workplace, including power-driven hoists/lifts used to elevate and transport patients/residents in hospitals, nursing homes, and residences.&#xA0; Prohibited equipment includes floor-based vertical powered patient/resident lift devices; ceiling-mounted vertical powered patient/resident lift devices; and powered sit-to-stand patient/resident lift devices.</p></li>
<li><p>On July 13, 2011, WHD issued Field Assistance Bulletin (FAB) 2011-3 (Assisting in the operation of power-driven patient/resident hoists/lifts Under the Child Labor Provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act) which states that WH will not charge a child labor violation when properly trained 16- and 17-year-olds, under specific conditions, assist a trained adult in the operation of power-driven patient/resident lifts/hoists.

<p>Name: Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven metal forming, punching, and shearing machines.</p>
<p>Originally Adopted: October 30, 1950</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Scope of HO 8</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The report establishing HO 8 concluded that metal-forming, punching and shearing machines are dangerous because they utilize a heavy crushing or powerful cutting action to perform their work, and because the operator is required in many cases to place his or her hands close to the point of operation in feeding them. Even with guards and better feeding methods, the report continued, these machines are extremely dangerous. In light of the preceding and the fact that state child labor laws varied greatly and did not reflect &#x201C;an awareness of the hazards of operating&#x201D; these machines, the report recommended the establishment of HO 8.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 8 is machine specific and it prohibits the operation, helping to operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning power-driven metal forming, punching, and shearing machines. The scope of this HO is narrow and does not include a very large group of metal working machines known as machine tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Definitions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The term operator shall mean a person who operates a machine covered by this HO by performing such functions as starting or stopping the machine, placing materials into or removing them from the machine, or any other functions directly involved in operation of the machine.</p></li>
<li><p>The term helper shall mean a person who assists in the operation of a machine covered by this HO by helping place materials into or removing them from the machine.</p></li>
<li><p>The term forming, punching, and shearing machines shall mean power-driven metal-working machines, other than machine tools, which change the shape of or cut metal by means of tools, such as dies, rolls, or knives which are mounted on rams, plungers, or other moving parts.</p></li>
<li><p>A rolling machine is a machine used to change the size or shape of metal by running it between rolls under pressure.</p></li>
<li><p>The term pressing or punching machines shall mean any machine falling within one of the three following types of machines:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A punch press is a machine fitted with a ram or plunger and a die for the purpose of blanking, trimming, drawing, punching, or stamping metal.</p></li>
<li><p>A power press is a large, slow acting press which performs an operation similar to a punch press, but is intended to handle very large or very heavy work.</p></li>
<li><p>A plate punch is a machine for punching holes (such as for rivets) in heavy metal plate.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><p>A bending machine is a machine for bending metal plate between a stationary bed and a moving ram (metal bending machines are known as brakes).</p></li>
<li><p>A hammering machine is a machine which employs a ram or plunger to pound the material being worked on into the desired shape.</p></li>
<li><p>A shearing machine is a machine for cutting metal by the shearing action of a movable blade or blades.</p></li>
<li><p>A guillotine shear is a machine used for cutting heavy metal plates which consists of a movable upper blade and a stationary lower blade. The upper blade comes down vertically to meet the lower stationary blade.</p></li>
<li><p>An alligator shear is a machine used for cutting barstock which consists of a movable upper blade and a stationary lower blade operating like scissors.</p></li>
<li><p>A circular shear is a machine with revolving disks which cut the material when it passes through the point where the revolving disks meet. It is used for cutting light metal sheets such as those used in tin cans.</p></li>
<li><p>Machine tools are power-driven complete metal-working machines having one or more tool-or work-holding devices, and are used for progressively removing metal in the form of chips. The following are the five principal types of machine tools classified by their function:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>Milling machine tools consist of machining a piece of metal by bringing it into contact with a rotating cutter with multiple cutting edges.</p></li>
<li><p>Planing machine tools consists of machining a surface by moving the work back and forth under a stationary cutting tool.</p></li>
<li><p>Turning machine tools consists of shaping a rotating piece by means of a cutting tool to generate a cylindrical surface.</p></li>
<li><p>Boring machine tools consists of cutting a round hole by means of a rotating cutting tool.</p></li>
<li><p>Grinding machine tools consists of shaping a piece by bringing it into contact with a rotating abrasive wheel.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The following is a list of power-driven machines that have been determined to be covered by HO&#xA0;8:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Automatic Bulkan Assembler (the Bulkan). This power-driven machine performs a bending or crimping action on metal and is covered by HO 8. The machine attaches pre-formed metal edged paper disks to the top and bottom of cylindrical paper sidewalls.</p></li>
<li><p>Hager press. This hydraulic press, designed to install a broad range of fasteners in flat or pre-formed sheet metal assemblies, is covered by HO 8.</p></li>
<li><p>Metal bottom seamer . This power-driven machine performs a rolling and bending action on metal and is covered under HO 8.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The following is a list of power-driven machines that have been determined not to be covered by HO 8:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Wheel crusher or rim removing machine . This machine separates a rim from a tire by using three dies attached to three rams to bend the tire and the metal rim. The rim is circular metal structure specially formed to fit the shape of a wheel, and not a metal plate or a flat piece of (sheet) metal as required by the HO. Moreover, the purpose of the machine is to separate the tire from its rim and not to form the rim into another shape (which would be the purpose of a bending machine). In light of the preceding, a wheel crusher is not a bending machine, or any other kind of metal forming, punching and shearing machine, and it is not covered by HO&#xA0;8.</p></li>
<li><p>Walco Precision Roller (series 60 and 67). This machine is used to coat metal and other materials with paint, various adhesives, and other substances. The machine does not form, shape, or reduce the thickness of metal (the function of a rolling machine) and it is not covered by HO 8.</p></li>
<li><p>Injection molding press. When used to manufacture plastic parts (as opposed to cutting or shaping metal), this machine is not covered by HO 8.</p></li>
<li><p>Flox wire cut electrical discharge machine. This machine cuts metal using a brass wire as an electrode. When the wire is brought near metal, an arc is created eroding the metal. Since this technology does not cut or shape metal with tools mounted on rams, plungers, or other moving parts, it is not a power-driven metal forming, punching or shearing machine, and is not covered by HO 8.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The following is a list of machine tools which are not covered by HO 8:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Key Duplicating Machines. These machines, often located in hardware stores and other retail establishments, duplicate keys by using a metal cutter. These machines are machine tools and therefore outside the scope of HO 8. An example of a key duplicating machine that has been determined to be a machine tool is the Axxess PC key machine (serial #0595187FP).</p></li>
<li><p>Ridgid 535 pipe and bolt threading machine. This machine is classified as machine tool and not a shearing machine, even though the cutting knife has a rotary motion. Since it is a machine tool, it is not covered by HO 8.</p></li>
<li><p>Landis pipe nipple and automatic pipe nipple machines. These machines are considered to be machine tools and not covered under HO 8.</p></li>
<li><p>Brake drum and brake disc lathes .These lathes (used to repair brakes in automotive and truck repair shops) are turning machines and are considered machine tools. They are outside the scope of HO 8.</p></li>
<li><p>Pipe threading equipment. Turning machines, such as the Rigid Model 1234 Threading Machine, are machine tools and not covered under HO 8.</p></li>

<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Scope of HO 9</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Prior to the enactment of HO 9, only coal mining (HO 3) was covered by a hazardous occupations order. Since the issuance of HO 9, all mining, with the exception of mining in the petroleum and natural gas industries, falls within the scope of a hazardous occupations order. An investigation of the mining industry concluded, in an April 1950 report, that all work in this industry involved an &#x201C;exceptionally high degree of accident risk&#x201D; and the employment of young people should be prohibited in the vast majority of mining occupations. Moreover, the report cited inadequate state child labor laws, which in many instances allowed children as young as 14 years of age to work in underground mines, as an additional reason for establishing HO 9.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 9 is industry specific. It applies to metal mines, nonmetal mines, ore-dressing plants, quarries, clay pits and clay mines, and sand and gravel operations. In terms of product mined, the HO covers: iron, copper, lead, zinc, and other metals, barite, gypsum, salt, sulfur, and other nonmetals, limestone, marble, granite, and other minerals. Its scope includes all occupations in connection with mining, other than coal, with the exception of certain surface occupations not directly concerned with the extraction or haulage of the mined material.</p></li>
<li><p>Many occupations prohibited by HO 9 may also be prohibited by other HOs. Examples include operating motor-vehicles (HO 2), using a power-driven chain saw to cut timber (HO 5), and operating some earth moving equipment while working in a tunnel (HO 17).</p></li>
<li><p>HO 9 does not cover work in coal mines which is prohibited by HO 3; in petroleum production; or in the production of natural-gas. The HO also does not prohibit work involving most manufacturing or processing operations applied to the extracted materials.</p></li>
<li><p>Definitions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The term all occupations in connection with mining, other than coal shall mean:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>All work performed underground in mines and quarries; on the surface at underground mines and underground quarries; in or about open-cut mines, open quarries, clay pits, and sand and gravel operations; at or about placer mining operations; at or about dredging operations for clay, sand or gravel; at or about bore-hole mining operations; in or about all metal mills, washer plants, or grinding mills reducing the bulk of the extracted minerals and at or about any other crushing, grinding, screening, sizing, washing or cleaning operations performed upon the extracted minerals except when those operations are performed as part of a manufacturing process.</p></li>
<li><p>The term shall not include work performed in subsequent manufacturing or processing operations, such as work performed in: smelters, electro-metallurgical plants, refineries, reduction plants, cement mills, plants where quarried stone is cut, sanded and further processed, or plants manufacturing clay, glass, or ceramic products.</p></li>
<li><p>Neither shall the term include work performed in connection with coal mining (see HO 3, FOH&#xA0;33h03), in petroleum production, in natural-gas production, nor in dredging operations which are not a part of mining operations, such as dredging for construction or navigation purposes.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The term placer mining shall mean the mining of a placer deposit (a surface deposit of loose particles of certain heavy minerals&#x2014;frequently gold) utilizing the following methods:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Placer dredging operations &#x2013; Operating in a pond, a placer dredge (a kind of floating washer plant) utilizes a series of buckets connected by a chain to scoop gravel from the bottom of the pond. The dredge is also equipped with machinery to recover the heavy metal from the gravel and dispose of the refuse.</p></li>
<li><p>Surface placer operations &#x2013; This method, often called sluicing, requires a source of water large enough to make a fast-flowing stream in a sluice box. At the upper end of the sluice there is a screen onto which gravel is shoveled or dumped. Water runs over the gravel on the screen, washing the fine gravel through it, and the heavy metal is caught on a bar fastened across bottom of the sluice box.</p></li>
<li><p>Hydraulic placer operations &#x2013; In this method, a powerful stream of water is used to break down earth and rock and guide the particles through channels into long sluices. Diesel power is used extensively for pumps, tractors, or for drag lines, and some operations use tractors equipped with a blade to push the material to the sluice box.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The term bore-hole mining shall mean a method of recovering some minerals (most notably sulfur and salt) by pumping compressed air into the holes bored down to the deposit to force the mineral to the surface.</p></li>
<li><p>The term metal mill operations shall mean a highly automated operation requiring few employees consisting of three distinct steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Preparation (crushing, grinding, cleaning, and classifying),</p></li>
<li><p>Separation (jigging, tabling, heavy-media separation, and froth flotation), and</p></li>
<li><p>Finishing (including settling, filtering, drying, and otherwise preparing the concentrates for shipment).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The term washer plant operations shall mean an operation performed to the ore after it is mined to remove clay and dirt form the solids.</p></li>
<li><p>The term grinding mill operations shall mean the reduction of the concentrate into a powder form at a grinding mill. This operation that occurs after the ore is cleansed at a washer plant.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Occupations PROHIBITED</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>All occupations involving underground work in mines or underground quarries.</p></li>
<li><p>All surface occupations at underground mines unless otherwise permitted by FOH&#xA0;33h09(c)(1).</p></li>
<li><p>All occupations involving work in or about open cut mines, open quarries (including crushing, screening, and washing), clay pits (including dredging), and sand and gravel operations (including dredging, washing, and screening), unless otherwise permitted by FOH&#xA0;33h09(c)(2).</p></li>
<li><p>All occupations involving work at or about placer mining and bore-hole mining operations, unless otherwise permitted by FOH&#xA0;33h09(c)(1).</p></li>
<li><p>All occupations involving work in metal mills, unless otherwise permitted by FOH&#xA0;33h09(c)(2).</p></li>
<li><p>All occupations involving work in washer plants or grinding mills, unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(1).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY BANNED</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The following occupations are permitted for 16- and 17- year-olds when performed at the surface of underground mines; in or about open pit mines, open quarries, clay pits and sand and grave operations; in surface placer mines, including placer dredging operations, hydraulic placer mining operations and bore-hole mining operations; and in washer plants or grinding mills:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Work in offices, in the warehouse or supply house, in the change house, in the laboratory, and in repair or maintenance shops not located underground. In the case of open quarries and other types of open-pit operations, this work is permitted in the pit or quarry proper, but not outside of the building itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Work in the operation and maintenance of living quarters (Some of this work may be prohibited by another HO).</p></li>
<li><p>Work outside of the mine in surveying, in the repair and maintenance of roads, and in general clean-up about the mine property (such as clearing brush and digging drainage ditches). This work is not permitted when done underground or in an open quarry or pit. For example, maintenance of roads in an open-cut mine would only be allowed if it was done outside of the open-cut.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The following work is permitted in metal mills:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Work involving the operation of jigs, sludge tables, flotation cells, or drier-filters.</p></li>
<li><p>Hand-sorting work at picking table or a picking belt.</p></li>
<li><p>General clean-up work.</p></li>
<li><p>Work of track crews in the building and maintenance of railroad tracks located in an area of an open-cut metal mine, if haulage and mining activities are not being conducted where the track crew is working. This exception applies only to metal mines, since such operations are vast in scale, much of the track work is physically removed from the extractive operation, and the track crew can work without undue exposure to hazard.</p></li>
<li><p>The only work permitted in mercury-recovery mills or mills using the cyanide process is the kind of work stated in FOH&#xA0;33h09(c)(1) above.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Exemptions</h4></p>
<p>There are no provisions in HO 9 for apprentices or student-learners. There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.</p></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Enforcement positions</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Peat moss</p>
<p>HO 9 does not apply to cutting, gathering, piling or any other occupation performed on peat moss. Peat moss is defined as partially decomposed sphagnum; consequently, it is not a mineral within the meaning of this order and any activities performed on it or to it would not be &#x201C;occupations in connection with mining.&#x201D;</p></li>
<li><p>Motor-vehicle operator and outside helper</p>
<p>HO 9 prohibits almost all work in or about a mine, which would include the occupations of motor-vehicle driver and outside helper. HO 2 also specifically prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from performing the occupations of motor-vehicle driver and outside helper in or about any mine, including an open pit mine or quarry.</p></li>
<li><p>Weighing trucks</p>
<p>The weighing of trucks filled with gravel, crushed stone, or other minerals is prohibited by HO 9. This work is prohibited even if the minors spend only a small percentage of their time weighing trucks and the majority of their work is confined to an office environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Processing stockpiled limestone into lime</p>
<p>HO 9 does not apply to occupations involved in the processing of stockpiled limestone into hydrated lime. This process is deemed to be manufacturing and not mining (the crushed stockpiled limestone is heated at extreme temperatures to create quicklime, water is then added to the quicklime to make hydrated lime which is shipped to the consumer). The prohibitions of HO 9 would cease to apply when the extracted, crushed, and screened limestone was stockpiled.</p></li>
<li><p>Railroad track work</p>
<p>Track work performed three miles from the open quarry is not an occupation prohibited by HO 9 as the work is not in close proximity to the mining haulage or to mining activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Processing marble into a finished building product</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The prohibitions of HO 9 apply to occupations in the processing of marble into a finished building material when it involves the following steps: the marble is quarried, run through a primary crusher, through a secondary crusher or grinding operation, and then into elevated storage bins. The finished product is loaded from these bins into bulk trucks or it is sacked and stored for later shipment.</p></li>
<li><p>This process is not deemed to be manufacturing since the marble has not been chemically changed and nothing was manufactured from the crushed marble (i.e. bricks, blocks, tile, etc.)</p></li>

<p>Occupations in the operation of power-driven meat-processing machines and occupations involving slaughtering, meat and poultry packing, processing, or rendering.</p>
<p>Originally Adopted: May 8, 1952</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Scope of HO 10</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Meat-packing was one of the most hazardous industries at the time HO 10 was promulgated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics issued Bulletin No. 855 (Injuries and Accident Causes in the Slaughtering and Meat-Packing Industries, 1943), which documented the hazards in this industry. Dangers included slips and falls on slippery floors, injuries from live animals, strains from overlifting, cutting hazards from sharp knives, and injuries from power-driven equipment. More recent publications issued by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) confirm the continued existence of these hazards and also cite the danger of steam burns, electric shock, and ergonomic injuries and illnesses.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 10 originally applied only to occupations in the slaughtering, rendering, and meat packing industries. When Congress amended the FLSA in 1961 to cover certain retail and service enterprises, WH amended HO 10 to cover work in such firms. Thus, HO 10 applies both on an industry basis (slaughtering, rendering, and meat-packing) and to the use of certain power-driven meat-processing machines (including meat slicers) whenever located in covered establishments and regardless of the material being processed. In 1981, HO 10 was again amended to clarify that restaurants, fast-food establishments, and other retail and service establishments are subject to HO&#xA0;10 and that 16- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from using power-driven meat processing equipment in those establishments.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 10 was amended in 1960 to add the occupations of setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning certain power-driven meat-processing machines. Prior to this, only the occupations of operating or feeding the various named machines were prohibited by HO 10. The 2010 revisions to HO 10 clarified that youth under 18 may not clean power-driven meat processing equipment, including the disassembled parts. This is true even if the equipment is disassembled and reassembled by an adult. Such youth may operate a commercial dishwasher to run a self-contained rack containing parts of or attachments to a power-driven meat processing machine through the dishwasher as long as the youth does not actually handle or touch the machine parts or attachments (see 75 FR 28435, see also &#xA7;&#xA0;570.61(a)(4)).</p></li>
<li><p>HO 10 was revised in 2010 and its prohibitions were extended to the slaughtering and processing of poultry. The term slaughtering and meat packing establishments was redefined to include places where poultry, buffalo, or deer, are killed, butchered, or processed. The term now also includes establishments which manufacture or process meat or poultry products including sausage or sausage casings from animals (see 75 FR 28434, see also &#xA7;&#xA0;570.61(b)).</p></li>
<li><p>HO 10 does not apply to the killing and processing of rabbits or small game in areas physically separated from the &#x201C;killing floor&#x201D;, or in separate establishments. It also does not apply to fish and seafood processing plants. These establishments were not included in the original study of meat-packing plants, were specifically excluded from the Order when it was issued, and amendments to the HO have not incorporated these establishments.</p></li>
<li><p>Definitions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The term retail/wholesale or service establishments includes establishments where meat or meat products, including poultry, are processed or handled, such as butcher shops, grocery stores, restaurants and quick service food establishments, hotels, delicatessens, and meat-locker (freezer-locker) companies, and establishments where any food product is prepared or processed for serving to customers using machines prohibited by this HO.</p></li>
<li><p>The term slaughtering and meat-packing establishments means places in or about which such animals as cattle, calves, hogs, poultry, sheep, lambs, goats, buffalo, deer, or horses are killed, butchered, or processed. The term also includes establishments which manufacture or process meat products or sausage casings from such animals.</p></li>
<li><p>The term rendering plants means establishments engaged in the conversion of dead animals, animal offal, animal fats, scrap meats, blood, and bones into stock feeds, tallow, inedible greases, fertilizer ingredients, and similar products.</p></li>
<li><p>The term killing floor includes a workroom, workplace where such animals as cattle, calves, hogs, poultry, sheep, lambs, goats, buffalo, deer, or horses are immobilized, shackled, or killed, and the carcasses are dressed prior to chilling. The killing floor does not include coolers.</p></li>
<li><p>The term curing cellar includes a workroom or workplace which is primarily devoted to the preservation and flavoring of meat, including poultry, by curing materials. It does not include a workroom or workplace solely where meats are smoked. The curing cellar may be located above or below ground.</p></li>
<li><p>The term hide cellar includes a workroom or workplace where hides are graded, trimmed, salted, and otherwise cured. The hide cellar may be located above or below ground.</p></li>
<li><p>The term boning occupations means the removal of bones from meat cuts. It does not include work that involves cutting, scraping, or trimming meat from cuts containing bones.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Application of HO 10 to handling of hot oils</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The original HO 10 banned, among other things, employment of minors in occupations involved in the recovery of lard and oils from slaughtered animals, and the rendering of animal fat. When Congress amended the FLSA in 1961 to cover certain retail and service enterprises, the Department of Labor amended HO 10 to extend to retail establishments, including fast food and full-service restaurants. Many such restaurants use commercial deep-fat fryers which have various attachments or built-in features to facilitate the refining and/or recycling of cooking fats or oils.</p></li>
<li><p>The refining, removing and/or recycling of cooking fats or oils in restaurants is not a process of &#x201C;rendering&#x201D; or &#x201C;recovery&#x201D; as described in the original HO 10 (see 29&#xA0;CFR&#xA0;570.61(a)(2) and (3)); neither is such refining, removing and/or recycling of cooking fats or oils covered by any other provision of HO 10. Furthermore, there was no specific change in the FLSA in 1961 to indicate any Congressional intent to include within the HO 10 prohibition, the handling of cooking fats or oils in restaurants.</p></li>
<li><p>Consequently, HO 10 does not prohibit minors under age 18 from being employed to clean such restaurant machines, to remove cooking fats or oils from them, or to clean the screening or filtering equipment.</p></li>
<li><p>However, CL Reg 3 does prohibit 14- and 15-year-olds from cleaning kitchen equipment (not otherwise prohibited), removing oil or grease filters, pouring oil or grease through filters, and moving receptacles containing hot grease or hot oil, when the equipment, surfaces, containers, and liquids exceed a temperature of 100 &#xB0;F (see FOH&#xA0;33c05(b)(1)a.).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Application of HO 10 to power-driven meat processing machines and bakery machines with attachments</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>A meat slicer with a chute attachment for processing hard-to-handle foods is covered by HO 10 as long as the meat-cutting blades are used, even though only non-meat items are being processed. Consequently, a 16- or 17-year-old may not operate, dismantle, reassemble, or clean this machine.</p></li>
<li><p>&#x201C;Food processors&#x201D; are prohibited if used to process meat. Likewise, bakery machines such as vertical dough mixers that have meat-processing attachments are covered by HO 10 when used to process meat; and HO 11 when used to process dough.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Cleaning of power-driven meat-processing machines</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>HO 10 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from cleaning power-driven meat processing machines. This prohibition includes the cleaning of the individual parts of such machines, including the blades&#x2014;even if the machine is dismantled and reassembled by an adult (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.61'>29 CFR 570.61(a)(4)</a>). However, such youth may operate a dishwasher to run a self-contained rack containing such individual parts through the dishwasher if the youth does not handle or touch the parts (see FOH 33h10(a)(3)).</p></li>
<li><p><a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.33'>29 CFR 570.33(e)</a> prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations which involve operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing power-driven food slicers and grinders, food choppers, food processors, food cutters, and food mixers.</p></li>

<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Scope of HO 11 </h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Historically, many occupational injuries occurring in bakeries are caused by a few specific machines. These injuries are often serious, producing a disproportionate share of deaths or permanent disabilities. HO 11 was issued to prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from operating certain power-driven bakery machines. This HO is machine-specific as discussed in FOH 33h00. The operation by 16- and 17-year-olds of other bakery machines not specifically prohibited by the order, while not encouraged, is permitted.</p></li>
<li><p>This order became effective prior to the 1961 and 1966 FLSA amendments which brought many previously uncovered retail bakeries and stores under the CL provisions. Some machines prohibited by HO 11 are found in retail bakeries, pizzerias, restaurants and other food service establishments &#x2013; others are only found in wholesale bakeries. Violations often occur in small bakeries where there is little division of labor and most jobs are performed by all employees.</p></li>
<li><p>The scope of this order includes, among other activities, operating, assisting to operate and cleaning the named machines wherever found in a covered establishment. Manually operated (not power-driven) machines are outside the scope of HO 11. Assisting to operate the named machines includes the loading of ingredients into the machines &#x2013; such as the placing of flour into a mixer &#x2013; even when the machines are &#x201C;turned off&#x201D; when the loading is performed.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 11 was revised in the 2010 Final Rule to include two exceptions related to certain lightweight, counter-top food mixers and certain pizza-dough rollers (see FOH 33h11(d)(2) and (d)(3)).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Occupations PROHIBITED</h4></p>
<p>Sixteen- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from operating, assisting to operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning the following power-driven bakery machines:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Horizontal dough mixer&#x2014;a horizontal cylinder with a horizontal shaft with mixing arms; revolves to mix the flour with water, yeast, salt, etc. to make dough. This prohibition includes operating a dough auger/feeder used to process masa for tortillas or tamales.</p></li>
<li><p>Vertical dough mixer&#x2014;a large bowl in which a vertical spindle with paddles attached mixes flour, water, etc. to make dough (often used in small bakery and some pizzerias).</p></li>
<li><p>Batter mixer&#x2014;very similar to vertical dough mixer, except different shaped paddles are used; often used for making cake batter. Power-driven &#x201C;wands&#x201D; used to mix items such as batters are also prohibited.</p></li>
<li><p>Bread and/or roll dividing, rounding, or molding machines&#x2014;in the past, separate machines performed the operation of dividing, rounding, and molding of dough for bread and rolls. More modern machines are multifunctional and may perform two or all three of these operations. The process involves cutting dough into lumps (for one loaf or batch of rolls), rolling each lump into a ball, and after &#x201C;proofing&#x201D;, forming a loaf or a batch of rolls. The operation is often continuous, dough being carried from one machine to another by conveyor.</p></li>
<li><p>Dough brake&#x2014;a machine which rolls dough into sheets.</p></li>
<li><p>Dough sheeter&#x2014;a machine which rolls dough into very thin sheets. This prohibition includes pizza dough rollers and tortilla roller/molders (also called moulders); but see special exception for operators of pizza dough rollers discussed in FOH&#xA0;33h11(d)(3).</p></li>
<li><p>Combination bread-slicing and wrapping machine&#x2014;a machine that slices a loaf of bread and wraps it in a continuous process (generally only found in large, wholesale type bakeries).</p></li>
<li><p>Cake cutting band saw&#x2014;a machine for cutting baked cakes into squares or rectangles.</p></li>
<li><p>Cookie and cracker machine&#x2014;combination machines which form cookies or crackers from dough. The operation is continuous, dough entering at one end and complete cookies or crackers, ready for baking, emerging at the other end. Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may serve on a cookie and cracker machine crew which actually operates the machine while producing cookies or crackers. These minors, however, may not set up or adjust these machines (see FOH&#xA0;33h11(c)(7)).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY BANNED</h4></p>
<p>There are a number of occupations involving the operation of power-driven machines in industrial and retail bakeries that are permitted for 16-and 17-year-old minors, including the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Ingredient preparation and mixing&#x2014;flour-sifting machine operator, flour-blending machine operator and sack-cleaning machine operator.</p></li>
<li><p>Product forming and shaping&#x2014;batter-sealing machine operator, depositing machine operator, cookie or cracker machine crew member (but not involving the setting up or adjusting of the machine), wafer machine operator, pretzel-stick machine operator, pie-dough sealing machine operator, pie-dough rolling machine operator, pie-crimping machine operator, and wedge press operator.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>A wedge press is a machine that uses two plates, often one of which is heated, to press balls of dough into the desired shape. Such presses are often used to shape tortillas.</p></li>
<li><p>Because the original study that led to HO 11 did not address such presses which do not utilize &#x201C;rollers,&#x201D; and subsequent rulemaking did not expand the scope of the HO in this respect, HO 11 does not prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from operating such machines.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Finishing and Icing&#x2014;depositing machine operator, enrobing machine operator, spray machine operator, icing mixing machine operator.</p></li>
<li><p>Slicing and Wrapping &#x2013;roll slicing and wrapping machine operator, cake wrapping machine operator, carton packing and sealing machine operator.</p></li>
<li><p>Pan washing&#x2014;spray-type pan washing machine operator, tumbler-type pan washing machine operator.</p></li>
<li><p>Donut and pastry filling&#x2014;donut and pastry filling machines, including Homogenette and similar machines which automatically inject fillings into donuts and pastries.</p></li>
<li><p>Cookie or Cracker Machine Crew Member&#x2014;Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may work on a crew operating a cookie or cracker machine. These machines, found in some wholesale bakeries, usually require crews of two to six persons. But minors may not perform work involving the setting up or adjusting of the cookie or cracker machine. These tasks, more hazardous than the operation of the machine during production, are usually performed by the crew chief (see FOH&#xA0;33h11(b)(9)).</p></li>
<li><p>Bread slicing&#x2014;Sixteen- and 17-year-old bakery or deli clerks may operate bread slicing and roll slicing machines of the type usually found in retail bakeries.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleaning individual parts of power-driven bakery machines</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>HO 11 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from cleaning power-driven bakery machines, but this prohibition does not apply to the cleaning of the individual parts of such machines. Only employees over 18 years of age may dismantle or reassemble such machines.</p></li>
<li><p><a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.33'>29 CFR 570.33(e)</a> prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations which involve operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing power-driven food mixers. Such minors may, however, clean the disassembled parts of such machines.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Exemptions </h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>There are no provisions in HO 11 for apprentices or student-learners. There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.</p></li>
<li><p>Application of HO 11 to lightweight, small capacity, counter-top food mixers.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Section 570.62(b)(1), effective July 19, 2010, provides an exception that allows 17- and 18-year-olds to operate, set up, adjust, repair, oil and clean lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top power-driven food mixers that are, or comparable to, models intended for household use.</p></li>
<li><p>For purposes of this exemption, a lightweight, small capacity mixer is one that is not hardwired into the establishment&#x2019;s power source, is equipped with a motor that operates at no more than &#xBD; horsepower, and is equipped with a bowl with a capacity of no more than five quarts.</p></li>
<li><p>This exemption shall not apply when the mixer is used, with or without attachments, to process meat or poultry products as prohibited by <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.61'>29 CFR 570.61(a)(4)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>This exemption does not extend to the employment of 14- and 15-year-old workers. Minors under 16 years of age are prohibited from operating or tending power-driven machinery, including mixers, by CL Reg 3 (see 29 CFR&#xA0;570.33(e)). That regulation prohibits such minors from operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing food mixers.</p></li>
<li><p>WH has determined that the following mixers are the type that would normally fall within this limited exemption contained at 29&#xA0;CFR&#xA0;570.62(b)(1).</p></li>
<li><p>The K-Tec Batter Mixer Model LJS developed for the Long John Silvers quick service restaurant chain. The Model LJS weighs about 8 pounds, is 11 inches in height, has a 3-quart capacity, and operates at 1/16 horsepower.</p></li>
<li><p>The Kitchen Aide counter top mixer Model K5SSWH, which is available for home use, weighs 29 pounds, is 16.4 inches in height, has a 5 quart capacity, and operates at 6/15 horsepower.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Application of HO 11 to certain power-driven pizza-dough rollers</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Pizza-dough rollers, a type of dough sheeter, are normally prohibited under HO 11. But &#xA7;&#xA0;570.62(b)(2) contains an exception that permits the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to operate certain pizza-dough rollers that meet the following conditions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>They are constructed with safeguards contained in the basic design so as to prevent fingers, hands, or clothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers,</p></li>
<li><p>They have gears that are completely enclosed, and</p></li>
<li><p>They have microswitches that disengage the machinery if the backs or sides of the rollers are removed.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>This exception applies only when all the safeguards in 1. through 3. above are present on the machine, are operational, and have not been overridden.</p></li>
<li><p>The policy described in (a) above does not extend to minors who set up, adjust, repair, oil or clean the assembled machine.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Enforcement positions</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Operation and cleaning of power-driven bagel slicers</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Bagel slicers which operate as electric knives</p>
<p>Sixteen- and 17-year-old employees may operate and clean power-driven bagel slicers, such as the Edgecraft Chef&#x2019;s Choice Bagel Pro Bagel Slicer, which have two blades mounted next to each other running in opposing directions.</p></li>
<li><p>Bagel slicers with circular cutting blades</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Some power-driven bagel slicers, like the Oliver Products Bagel and Bun Slicer (Model 702) meet the definition of a circular saw under HO 14. These machines saw bagels in half by means of a thin steel disc, having a continuous series of notches or teeth on the periphery, mounted on shafting. Although HO 11 does not address such bagel slicers, HO 14 would normally prohibit employees under 18 years of age from operating, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning such machines.</p></li>
<li><p>At the request of WH, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has examined the operation of these machines and has advised WH that employees 16 and 17 years of age who operate and clean such slicers (with circular blades and enclosed feed chutes) are exposed to low safety risks. NIOSH cited the machine&#x2019;s adjustable guard and the manufacturer&#x2019;s warning sign as important contributors to this low degree of risk.</p></li>
<li><p>WH will not assert a violation of HO 14 when 16- and 17-year-old employees operate a power-driven bagel slicer with a circular blade and enclosed feed chute when the machine is equipped with an adjustable guard that covers the feed chute and the manufacturer&#x2019;s warning sign is affixed to the machine. WH will not assert a violation of HO 14 when 16- and 17-year-old employees clean such machines. Such minors, however, continue to be prohibited from setting up, adjusting, repairing, or oiling such machines.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>All power-driven bagel slicers are &#x201C;food slicers&#x201D; under CL Reg 3 and therefore minors under 16 years of age may not operate, tend, set up, adjust, clean, oil or repair such equipment (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.33'>29 CFR 570.33(e)</a>).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Operation of pie-dough rollers by 16- and 17-year old</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The original investigative report establishing HO 11 determined that the operation of pie-dough rollers by 16- and 17-year-olds is safe, however, this determination applies only to those pie-dough rollers which involve a completely automated process as used in large wholesale bakeries.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>This process includes the use of a pie-dough scaling machine which automatically cuts a predetermined portion of pie dough and drops it into the &#x201C;hopper feed&#x201D; of the pie-dough roller. The pie-dough roller then flattens the dough and automatically rotates the dough through an arc of 90&#xB0;. The pie dough is again flattened to form the desired final shape. The entire process eliminates any hand contact by the operator with the rollers during operation.</p></li>
<li><p>If a pie-dough roller operates as described above &#x2013; in an entirely automatic process with a machine that cuts the dough into predetermined portions and drops it into a hopper feed or chute attachment that prevents an operator from making contact with any in-running points of the rollers &#x2013; 16- and 17-year olds may operate this equipment.</p></li>
<li><p>If the pie-dough roller does not operate as described above, it is prohibited by HO 11.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Certain pie-dough rolling machines are very similar to pizza-dough roller machines in appearance and function (see FOH 33h11(d)(3) for a discussion about pizza-dough rollers). HO 11 prohibits the operation of all pie-dough rollers except those described in (a) above. However, WH will not charge a violation of HO 11 regarding the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds who operate pie-dough rollers that are constructed with safeguards contained in the basic design that prevent fingers, hands, and clothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers; have gears that are completely enclosed; and have microswitches that disengage the machinery if the backs or sides of the rollers are removed. The policy applies to such machinery provided that all safeguards are present on the machine, are operational, and have not been overridden. This &#x201C;no violation&#x201D; policy does not extend to minors who set up, adjust, repair, oil, or clean this equipment.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Application of HO 11 to dough mixers used to mix ingredients other than dough or batter and to attachments designed for uses other than dough or batters.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Under HO 11 the function of the agitators determines coverage of the HO. Therefore, a dough mixer used to mix vegetables is covered by HO 11 if the same agitators are used as for mixing dough. Agitators such as the flat beater, heavy duty wire whip, dough arm, and sweet dough arm are covered by HO 11 because they are designed for use with dough and batter.</p>
<p>However, if the machine is equipped with separate agitators designed for use with vegetables or with icing, the functional use of the machine would be different and it would not be covered.</p></li>
<li><p>D-Wire Whip&#x2014;Occasionally, manufacturers will report that some attachments are designed solely for use on products lighter than dough or batters such as whipping cream, egg whites, light icings, and meringues. This was the case with the D-Wire Whip manufactured by Hobart. Field experience has documented that employers are using the D-Wire-Whip to mix batters and other items like cream cheese despite the intentions or statements of the manufacturer. It is a violation of HO 11 for 16- and 17-year-olds to mix batter, cream cheese, or dough using a power-driven batter mixer or dough mixer, regardless of the design specifications or intentions of the manufacturer.</p></li>
<li><p>I-Wire Whip&#x2014;The I-Wire Whip attachment, which is used for heavier products such as cake batter and heavy whipping cream, is also prohibited by HO 11 for use by 16- and 17-year-olds.</p></li>
<li><p>Cheese Grater or Cheese/Vegetable Slicer Attachments</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>HO 11 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from placing attachments on vertical dough mixers (such as the cheese grater or vegetable slicer) or removing such attachments, because those activities constitute the setting up and adjusting of a power-driven bakery machine.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 11 does not, however, prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from operating attachments to vertical dough mixers that grate cheese or slice cheese/vegetables as long as someone at least 18 years of age sets up or adjusts the attachment. This is because these attachments negate the operation of the machine as a vertical dough mixer. The machine cannot be used as a power-driven bakery machine (a dough mixer) when such attachments are being used. However, such minors would be prohibited from operating any attachment to the mixer that processes meat, such as a meat chopper or sausage maker, because of HO 10.</p></li>

<p>Name: Occupations involved in the operation of balers, compactors, and paper-products machines</p>
<p>Originally Adopted: September 11, 1954</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Scope of HO 12</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>HO 12 was issued in response to the finding that the paper-products industry experienced a somewhat higher general frequency of injury rate than all manufacturing industries as a whole, and a somewhat higher frequency of the more serious types of injuries and of deaths. The prohibitions regarding scrap paper balers were established to combat the dangers of being caught in the plungers during the compression process and suffering strains and other injuries while moving the compressed bales.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 12 prohibits those under 18 years of age from operating and assisting to operate certain power-driven machines used in the manufacture or conversion of paper or pulp into a finished product or in the preparation of such products for recycling or disposal. The HO applies wherever the machines are located when operated by a covered employee.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 12 was revised effective February 14, 2005 (see 69 FR 75393, December 16, 2004, for more information). The major revisions included:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Incorporating the provisions of the Compactors and Balers Safety Standards Modernization Act (August 6, 1996) which created FLSA &#xA7; 13(c)(5). This section, among other things, prohibits minors under 18 years of age from operating and unloading balers and compactor, and permits 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not operate or unload, certain balers and compactors under specific conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Expanding the prohibitions of the HO to include balers and compactors that process other materials in addition to paper. Prior to February 14, 2005, only balers and compactors that processed paper products exclusively fell under the prohibitions of HO 12 (see FOH 3312(b)(1)a for information regarding the impact of this revision).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>HO 12 was again revised by a Final Rule, effective July 19, 2010. That revision brought all power-driven compactors and balers, regardless of the materials being processed, under the prohibitions of HO 12. The revision also clarified that the limited exemption contained in FLSA &#xA7; 13(c)(5) that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not operate or unload, certain equipment applies only to scrap paper balers and paper box compactors.</p></li>
<li><p>Definitions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The term operating or assisting to operate means all work that involves starting or stopping a machine covered by this section, placing materials into or removing materials from a machine, including clearing a machine of jammed materials, paper, or cardboard, or any other work directly involved in operating the machine. The term does not include the stacking of materials by an employee in an area nearby or adjacent to the machine where such employee does not place the materials into the machine.</p></li>
<li><p>The term paper products machine shall mean all power-driven machines used in:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>the remanufacture or conversion of paper or pulp into a finished product, including preparation of materials for recycling, or</p></li>
<li><p>The preparation of such materials for disposal&#x2014;whether the machines are used in establishments that manufacture converted paper or pulp products or in any other type of establishment.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Compactors</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The term paper box compactor means a powered machine that remains stationary during operation, used to compact refuse, including paper boxes, into a detachable or integral container or into a transfer vehicle.</p></li>
<li><p>The term compactor that is designed or used to process materials other than paper means a powered machine that remains stationary during operation, designed or used to compact refuse other than paper or cardboard boxes into a detachable or integral container or into a transfer vehicle.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Balers</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The term scrap paper baler means a powered machine used to compress paper and possibly other solid waste, with or without binding, to a density or form that will support handling and transportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable container.</p></li>
<li><p>The term baler that is designed or used to process materials other than paper means a powered machine designed or used to compress materials other than paper and cardboard boxes, with or without binding, to a density or form that will support handling and transportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable container.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The term Applicable American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard means one of the standards listed in the chart contained in FOH&#xA0;33h11(d)(2)a1 The ANSI standard for scrap paper balers and paper box compactors govern the manufacturing and modification of the equipment, the operation and maintenance of the equipment, and employee training. The Secretary of Labor may add more recent standards to the chart upon finding that the newer standards are as protective of the safety of minors as those already on the list.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Occupations PROHIBITED</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>HO 12 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from operating, assisting to operate, setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning the following power-driven paper products machines, including those which do not involve hand feeding, as well as balers and compactors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>All balers and compactors, regardless of the materials being processed. This prohibition includes equipment designed to process only paper, equipment designed to process materials other than paper, and equipment that can process both paper and other materials.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>HO 12 was revised effective February 14, 2005, to expand the prohibitions of the HO to include balers and compactors that process other materials in addition to paper. Prior to February 14, 2005, only those balers and compactors that processed paper products exclusively (no other materials placed in the machine) fell under the prohibitions of HO 12.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 12 was again revised, effective July 19, 2010 to prohibit youth under 18 years of age from operating, assisting to operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning all compactors and balers, regardless of the materials being processed.</p></li>
<li><p>Other materials which are processed by scrap paper balers and paper box compactors include, but are not limited to, plastics, rubber, food waste, foam rubber and aluminum cans. The risks which these machines present to minor employees remain the same, regardless of the materials being processed.</p></li>

<li><p>The employer must provide notice and post a notice on each piece of equipment stating that the equipment meets the appropriate ANSI standard named above; that 16- and 17-year-olds may only load the equipment; and that any employee under 18 may not operate or unload such equipment.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><p>WH has determined that &#x201C;posting&#x201D; a prominent and easily visible notice will also satisfy the requirement that notice be &#x201C;provided&#x201D; (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.63'>29 CFR 570.63(c)(1)(iv)</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>There is no one format that the notice must follow to satisfy the posting requirement, but WH believes that the intent of FLSA &#xA7; 13(c)(5) will be satisfied if each notice:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>Contains an accurate statement that the baler or compactor to be loaded by the minor meets the applicable ANSI standard named in &#xA7; 13(c)(5)(B)(i)(I) of the FLSA or meets a more recent ANSI standard which the Secretary has certified to be at least as protective of the safety of minors as the standard described in FLSA &#xA7;&#xA0;13(c)(5)(B)(i)(I); and</p></li>
<li><p>Cites the specific ANSI standard, including the year of issuance, that the employer is providing notice that the equipment meets; and</p></li>
<li><p>Includes a clear statement that 16- and 17-year-olds may only load the scrap paper balers and paper box compactors; and,</p></li>
<li><p>Includes a clear statement that no employee under the age of 18 may operate or unload the scrap paper balers and paper box compactors.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>WH has been advised that industry associations such as the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) and the National Grocers Association (NGA) have developed and marketed to their members &#x201C;notices&#x201D; or &#x201C;stickers&#x201D; believing that such notices or stickers comport with the requirements of FLSA &#xA7;&#xA0;13(c)(5).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>WH has examined the sample notices or stickers created by both the NGA and the FMI and, as discussed in the preamble to the final rule that became effective on February 14, 2005, noted that these stickers do not satisfy the posting requirements of FLSA &#xA7; 13(c)(5) (see 69 FR 75394, December 16, 2004). The stickers do not clearly identify the applicable ANSI standard as required. ANSI includes, in the caption or title of each of its standards, both a &#x201C;series identifier&#x201D; and a year of issuance, so as to eliminate confusion between different editions of standards that apply to the same type of machinery.</p></li>
<li><p>WH will consider the NGA and FMI stickers to constitute acceptable notices if they are modified to state explicitly the full caption of the ANSI standard (both the series identifier and the year of issuance). This modification may, of course, be made by printing all future stickers with the full, accurate information as to the specific applicable standard. But existing stickers may also be modified by making hand-written insertions of the additional information that is necessary to identify the specific standard. Such insertions must be written legibly, in indelible ink, and in the same size of lettering as the ANSI standard identifiers already printed on the sticker.</p></li>
<li><p>The NGA and the FMI have also developed stickers to be placed on equipment that does not meet the requirements of the limited exemption contained in FLSA &#xA7; 13(c)(5) and, therefore, cannot be loaded, operated or unloaded by any employee who is less than 18 years of age. These stickers, which are not required by the Act and the use of which is completely voluntary, alert employees that they may not load, operate or unload the equipment unless they are 18 years of age or older.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Community-owned or -operated balers and compactors In certain situations, such as at a shopping mall, industrial park, office building, or military base, multiple employers may have access to and use community balers and compactors that the facilities manager or owner has made available to the tenants or contractors.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>In these situations, it is not necessary for every employer (tenant) to post a notice as required by FLSA &#xA7; 13(c)(5). The facilities manager or owner, or the owner of the equipment, may make the necessary postings and satisfy each employer&apos;s (tenant&apos;s) posting obligations under the exception.</p></li>
<li><p>But, should the notice not be accurate or complete&#x2014;i.e., the baler or compactor fails to meet the appropriate ANSI standard, or the notice fails to fully identify the appropriate ANSI standard&#x2014;the burden of compliance remains with the employer (tenant) of any youth who loaded the equipment. An incomplete or inaccurate posting by the facilities manager or owner will not relieve a tenant from being charged with a violation of HO 12.</p>
<p>75 FR 28440-41 (May 20, 2010)</p></li>
<li><p>Employers cannot delegate their responsibilities for compliance by relying on the accuracy of notices posted by others.</p></li>

<li><p>The equipment must include an on-off switch incorporating a key-lock or other system, and the control of the system is maintained in the custody of employees who are at least 18 years of age. The &#x201C;other system&#x201D; may be a numerical touch pad but the passcode may not be shared with employees under the age of 18 years.</p></li>
<li><p>The on-off switch of the equipment must be maintained in an off position when the equipment is not in operation.</p></li>
<li><p>The equipment cannot be operated while it is being loaded.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The language and legislative history of the amendment make it clear that it is the responsibility of the employer to make the initial determination that the equipment to be loaded by 16- and 17-year-olds meets the appropriate ANSI standards. It is also the employer&#x2019;s responsibility to provide the notice and post it on each piece of equipment which is loaded by 16- and 17-year-olds. For enforcement purposes, the posting of the notice will also satisfy the requirement that notice be provided.</p></li>
<li><p>Loading of scrap paper balers and paper box compactors not only encompasses the placing of materials into the machines, but also includes placing materials into chutes that, by gravity, feed the materials to the machines.

<li><p>Kansmacker</p>
<p>The kansmacker is a power-driven machine that sorts, counts and flattens beverage cans. It is not covered by HO 12.</p></li>
<li><p>Decollators and bursters</p>
<p>A decollator is a machine which separates stacks of multi-part paper into individual stacks (for each copy) while removing the carbon paper. It is often capable of trimming the pin-feed holes from one or both sides. A burster is a machine that takes continuous single copy and bursts it into individual sheets or pages. These machines do not come within the definition of paper products machines and are not covered under HO 12.</p></li>
<li><p>Cylinder press</p>
<p>HO 12 does not prohibit the operation of a cylinder press. Such machines are considered much less hazardous than platen presses, where feeding takes place at the point of operation.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper shredders</p>
<p>The operation of paper shredders is not prohibited by HO 12. In addition, paper shredders of the type normally used in offices may be operated by minors 14 and 15 years of age.</p></li>
<li><p>Stitcher-trimmer machine</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>A stitcher-trimmer machine automatically collates, stitches (inserts wire staples), and trims such things as pamphlets, periodicals, and other paper products. WHD has examined stitcher-trimmer machines and has determined that HO 12 does not prohibit minors from operating those stitcher-trimmer machines that do not use a guillotine paper cutter or shear to trim the product. This machine is not to be confused with an arm-type wire stitcher or stapler &#x2013; a power-driven machine prohibited by HO 12, operated by a foot treadle, and used to stitch or staple cartons together (see FOH&#xA0;33h12(b)(1)b).</p></li>
<li><p>HO 12 does prohibit youth under 18 years of age from operating those stitcher-trimmers that use a guillotine paper cutter or shear to trim the product. Such prohibited equipment includes the STAHL ST-90 and the Stitchmaster ST-100, both manufactured by Heidelberg.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>LiftPak compactor</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The LiftPak Compactor Model 1000, manufactured by LiftPak, L.C., is an indoor compactor that processes material, including paper products, by use of a ram. This equipment is often used by quick service restaurants. When it is time to unload the machine, a built-in cart containing the compacted waste is detached from the machine and manually wheeled to the dumpster. The operator then pushes a button on the cart and an electric lift raises the compacted refuse to the height of the dumpster. After the lift tray is released, the refuse is allowed to fall into the dumpster by gravity. The operator then lowers the lift and wheels the cart back to the main machine for reattaching.</p></li>
<li><p>Because the LiftPak Compactor Model 1000 is a compactor that processes materials such as food waste and plastic in addition to paper products, youth under 18 years of age are prohibited from operating and unloading such equipment (as of February 14, 2005)&#x2014;and may only load such equipment if they meet the requirements of the exemption contained in HO 12 (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.63'>29 CFR 570.63(c)</a> and FOH&#xA0;33h12(d)(2)). The prohibition on unloading includes all the activities associated with depositing the compacted refuse into the dumpster, including returning and reattaching the built-in cart to the equipment.</p></li>
<li><p>WH learned that LiftPak, L.C. has marketed the Model 1000 as a compactor that &#x201C;employees don&#x2019;t have to be 18 to operate&#x2026;&#x201D; and has stated on its Webpage that the Department of Labor has approved the equipment for use by employees 16 and older. Although such advertisements may have been proper prior to the publication of the Final Rule that modified HO 12 effective February 14, 2005, this information is no longer correct.</p></li>
<li><p>The electric lift that raises the detached compaction compartment to the height of the dumpster during the unloading process cannot be considered a hoisting apparatus prohibited under HO 7. But as mentioned in (b) above, the detaching, emptying, and reattaching of the container containing the waste is prohibited as &#x201C;unloading&#x201D; under HO 12.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The rate of injuries in the clay/silica construction products industry (as determined by the report establishing HO 13) exceeded the injury rate (including serious injuries) found in the majority of manufacturing establishments. The report attributed the higher frequency of worker injuries in this industry to: lifting, carrying, and pushing heavy objects; bricks falling on workers from stacks or out of the workers&#x2019; hands onto themselves, vehicle&#x2014;pedestrian accidents, machine injuries, and falls caused by slippery floors. The report recommended that a Hazardous Occupations Order be created to ban the employment of minors in most occupations in the clay/silica construction products industry.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 13 is industry specific. It applies to all work in or about plants manufacturing clay construction products &#x2013; except work in the drying departments of plants manufacturing sewer pipe, in storage and shipping, in offices, in laboratories, and in storerooms. It also applies to work in or about plants manufacturing silica brick, or other silica refractories, except work in offices.</p></li>
<li><p>Definitions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The term clay construction products includes the following: brick, hollow structural tile, sewer pipe and kindred products, refractories, and other clay products, such as: architectural terra cotta, glazed structural tile, roofing tile, stove lining, chimney pipes and tops, wall coping, and drain tile. The term does not include non-structural clay products, such as ceramic floor and wall tile, mosaic tile, glazed and enameled tile, faience and similar tile. Nor does the term include non-clay construction products such as sand-lime brick, glass brick, or non-clay refractories.</p></li>
<li><p>The term silica brick or other silica refractories means refractory products produced from raw materials containing free silica as their main constituent.</p></li>
<li><p>The terms drawing and wheeling shall mean the process of removing brick, after it has cooled, from the kiln to storage.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Glazing of cylinders</p>
<p>Work in and about a plant where silica, lime, and asbestos are mixed together to form a glaze (subsequently used to coat the inside of cylinders) is work prohibited by HO 13. The glaze contains free silica as a main constituent; consequently, the area where it is produced meets the definition of an establishment where silica refractories are manufactured (see 29&#xA0;CFR 570.64(a)(2) and 570.64(b)(2)). In light of the preceding, work in or about such an establishment is prohibited.</p></li>
<li><p>Asbestos</p>
<p>Asbestos is a form of magnesium silicate; however, it does not contain any free silica. Since it does not contain free silica, establishments manufacturing asbestos are not making a silica refractory and are not covered by HO 13.</p></li>
<li><p>Shipping and storage of brick</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Preparing bricks for storage, inside the manufacturing building and adjacent to the kilns (even after the bricks have been removed from the kiln and placed on flat cars), is work covered by HO 13. For example: stacking the bricks on skids, and strapping them down in order to move them to a storage area outside the building, is work considered to be within the drawing and wheeling department and not within the purview of storage and shipping.</p></li>
<li><p>Removing bricks from inside the kiln in the process of loading them or moving them to storage, is not work in storage and shipping, and therefore is covered by HO 13.</p></li>

HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 14&#x2014;Power Driven Circular Saws, Band Saws, Guillotine Shears, Chain Saws, Reciprocating Saws, Wood Chippers, and Abrasive Cutting Discs.</strong></h4>
<p>Name: Occupations involved in the operation of circular saws, band saws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, and abrasive cutting discs.</p>
<p>Originally Adopted: November 15, 1960</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Scope of HO 14</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>HO 14 is broad and embraces the use of circular saws, band saws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, and abrasive cutting discs wherever they are used&#x2014;other than in the industries where they are already prohibited by earlier HOs. This HO differs from most other HOs in that it recognizes that the above named machines are banned irrespective of the specific industry in which they are used or the specific materials (paper, meat, metal, etc.) upon which they are being used. The use of most saws and shears is prohibited by HOs 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, and 12. HO 14 was issued to &#x201C;close the gap&#x201D; and protect youths working in other industries where such machines are used.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Examples include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>HO 4 prohibits the use of chain saws by minors in logging operations.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 5 prohibits the use of saws in woodworking operations such as furniture factories and construction sites.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 8 prohibits the use of guillotine shears on metal.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 10 prohibits the use of saws to cut meat and bones.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 11 prohibits the use of saws to cut bakery products.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 12 prohibits the use of saws and shears to cut paper products.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>HO 14 became effective before the 1961 and 1966 amendments to the FLSA that made previously noncovered retail stores subject to the child labor provisions. It was revised by the 2010 Final Rule (see 75 FR 28404), which added more types of prohibited machines. Since the scope of HO 14 is broad, it can be applied to circular saws, band saws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, and abrasive cutting discs found in all establishments covered by the FLSA.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally, WH will only charge a single violation when the same piece of equipment is prohibited by HO 14 and another HO (such as HO 5, HO 11, HO 12, etc.) WH normally will apply the provisions of HO 14 whenever a piece of equipment named in HO 14 is the subject of the violation. For example, wood chippers meet the definition of power-driven woodworking machines contained in &#xA7; 570.55(b) and therefore are prohibited by HO 5. But because such equipment is specifically named in HO 14, and is used in a variety of establishments (saw milling, pallet shops, mulch manufacturing, landscape services, waste disposal and recycling, etc.), WH will generally charge violations regarding the operating and assisting in the operation of wood chippers under HO 14.</p></li>
<li><p>The scope of this order includes operating, assisting to operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or and cleaning the named equipment wherever found in a covered establishment.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 14 covers only power-driven equipment; any occupation that involves only manually operated saws, cutting discs, or shears (not power-driven) is outside the scope of the HO.</p></li>

<p>Name: Occupations in Roofing Operations and On or About a Roof</p>
<p>Originally Adopted: December 27, 1961</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Scope of HO 16</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>At the time HO 16 was written, roofing had long been recognized as one of the most hazardous occupations in the building construction industry. The report establishing HO 16 determined the hazards associated with roofing &#x2013; such as falling from roofs and leaning out over the edge of a roof to receive hoisted materials &#x2013; were difficult to control and the resulting injuries were frequently very serious. In light of this, the report concluded that &#x201C;all work performed in connection with the application of weather-proofing materials and substances to the roofs of buildings and structures is too hazardous for the employment of 16 and 17 year old persons.&#x201D;</p></li>
<li><p>HO 16 was originally specific to the roofing industry, prohibiting all roofing industry operations, including those operations not performed on a roof. HO 16 was revised, effective February 14, 2005, to also prohibit all work on or about a roof (see 69 FR 75397-98).</p></li>
<li><p>Definitions (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.67'>29 CFR 570.67(b)</a>)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The term roofing operations means all work performed in connection with the installation of roofs, including related metal work such as flashing, and applying weatherproofing materials and substances (such as waterproof membranes, tar, slag or pitch, asphalt prepared paper, tile, composite roofing materials, slate, metal, translucent materials, and shingles of asbestos, asphalt, wood or other materials) to roofs of buildings or other structures. The term also includes all jobs on the ground related to roofing operations such as roofing laborer, roofing helper, materials handler and tending a tar heater.</p></li>
<li><p>The term on or about a roof includes all work performed upon or in close proximity to a roof, including carpentry and metal work, alterations, additions, maintenance and repair, including painting and coating of existing roofs; the construction of the sheathing or base of roofs (wood or metal), including roof trusses or joists; gutter and downspout work; the installation and servicing of television and communication equipment such as cable and satellite dishes; the installation and servicing of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment or similar appliances attached to roofs; and any similar work that is required to be performed on or about roofs.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The regulatory phrase on or about a roof is not limited to circumstances where the minor employee is standing or working on the roof itself. The prohibition extends to standing or working on a ladder or scaffold at or near the roof, working on the installation of roof trusses or joists which will support the roof, as well as working from or being transported to or from the roof in mechanical devices such as hoists.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally, 16- and 17-year-olds may legally perform certain occupations that require them to work at heights, such as painting, window washing, installing siding, and the power-washing of walls. But such occupations would be prohibited when the minor is required to work in close proximity to a roof. WH has adopted two enforcement positions that provide guidance as to when the employment of a youth performing such occupations violates HO&#xA0;16 because he or she is working in close proximity to a roof (See FOH&#xA0;33h16(d)(1)).</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Occupations PROHIBITED</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>HO 16 prohibits all occupations in roofing operations. This includes work done on the ground such as material handling, tending tar kettles, and clean-up work.</p></li>
<li><p>As of February 14, 2005, HO 16 also prohibits the performance of any work on or about a roof.</p></li>
<li><p>Minors under 18 years of age are also prohibited from using a roof as a point of access, egress, or a platform from which to access or perform other work such as window washing or the rigging of window washing equipment.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Exemptions</h4></p>
<p>HO 16 does contain an exemption for student-learners and apprentices. There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Working in close proximity to a roof</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Single-story building</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>WH will not charge a violation of HO 16 when a minor is working in proximity to a roof of a one-story building as long as the minor&#x2019;s feet are never more than three feet off the ground level. The three-foot tolerance is measured from the ground or pavement at the base of the building to the bottom of the minor&#x2019;s feet.</p></li>
<li><p>The minor is still prohibited from performing any work described in FOH 33h16(a)(3) above.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Multiple-story building</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>WH will not charge a violation of HO 16 when a minor is working in proximity to a roof of a multi-story building (a building of more than one story) if the minor always maintains a distance of at least three feet (36 inches) from the roof edge. The 36 inches is measured from the top of the youth&#x2019;s head to bottom edge of the roof that is directly over (perpendicular to) the youth&#x2019;s head.</p></li>
<li><p>A distance of 3 feet ensures that the working minor, no matter how long his or her reach, will not come into contact with the bottom edge of the roof of a multi-story building.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a straight, vertical line from the top of the minor&#x2019;s head to the bottom of the roof&#x2019;s edge to measure the 36 inch allowance permits minors to work at various heights on buildings that do not have horizontal or single-level roof lines, such as split level buildings, gabled buildings and sheds.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The enforcement positions discussed in a. and b. above apply only as long as the minor does not use the roof to egress the work area and is not performing work that is prohibited by HO 16 or any other HO.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Removal of an old roof</p>
<p>The tearing off of the old roof in conjunction with the installation of a new roof is considered a &#x201C;roofing operation&#x201D; and is covered under HO 16, notwithstanding that different mechanics may perform this work in various geographic areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Metal buildings</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Prior to February 14, 2005, the installation of metal roofs generally did not fall within the prohibitions of HO 16 because such work was normally performed entirely by ironworkers, steelworkers, or sheet metal mechanics &#x2013; not by roofers. Consequently, in most instances, this work was not considered a &#x201C;roofing operation&#x201D; prohibited by HO 16. On February 14, 2005, HO 16 was revised to prohibit youth under 18 years of age from installing metal roofs, including those on metal buildings (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.67'>29 CFR 570.67(b)</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Roofing companies do occasionally remove existing all-metal roofs and replace them, and the purlins, with a new roof. The work continues to be considered a &#x201C;roofing operation&#x201D; covered by HO 16.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Weatherproofing the top of television transmitting towers</p>
<p>The definition of a roofing operation includes the application of weatherproofing materials to roofs of buildings, or other structures (see <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/570.67'>29 CFR 570.67(b)</a>). Consequently, weatherproofing the top of television transmitting towers is covered by HO 16.</p></li>
<li><p>Measuring a roof</p>
<p>The measuring of a roof to estimate the cost of a new roof is work &#x201C;performed in connection with the installation of roofs&#x2026;&#x201D; and it is covered by HO 16.</p></li>

<li><p><h4 class="testClass">Scope of HO 17</h4></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Individuals employed in excavation operations (which includes trenching, building excavation, tunneling, and shaft sinking) are exposed to injury producing hazards such as cave-ins, falls climbing in and out of the excavated site, working in close proximity with heavy earth moving machines, and the fall of rock from the sides and roof of the site. Excavation operations were selected for study, according to the report establishing HO 17, because several states had requested an investigation by the Department and because the Department had received many reports concerning minors being injured while employed in excavation operations. Fatalities and injuries resulting from cave-ins are still a problem in the construction industry. On April 17, 1998, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) issued a &#x201C;warning&#x201D; concerning the danger of cave-ins. This report stated that six workers were killed by cave-ins in the first four months of 1998, and that, on average, 60 people die each year in accidents caused by cave-ins.</p></li>
<li><p>HO 17 is process specific. The scope of HO 17 includes all work excavating, working in, and backfilling trenches; excavating for buildings or other structures and working in such excavations; driving tunnels; and sinking shafts, except in certain specified situations (see FOH 33h17(c)). It does not include site clearing or surface grading operations, dredging and bore-hole drilling operations, and mining and quarrying operations covered by HO 3 and HO 9.</p></li>
<li><p>Definitions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The term excavation operation means the removal of earth, rock, or other material to form a cavity below the surface of the ground.</p></li>
<li><p>The term trenches includes ditches (see Acting Administrator Flynn&apos;s letter of January 24, 1990).</p></li>

<p>Road graders</p>
<p>The use of road graders (power-driven earth moving equipment) in excavation operations is prohibited by HO 17. The study conducted by the Department that established HO 17 did not include surface grading operations (i.e. use of road graders). However, as HO 17 only permits manual excavation or backfilling and only at a depth of up to four feet &#x2013; and road graders constitute mechanized excavation, often in ditches up to six feet in depth &#x2013; the use of road graders is prohibited.</p></li>
