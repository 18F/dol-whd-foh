              <p>(a)   Coverage under the PCA is explained in Part I of
R&amp;I No. 3.</p><p>(b)  While it has not been authoritatively settled that
there is no coverage under the PCA if the PCA stipulations are not included in
the contract, either directly or by reference, coverage is not asserted for a
contractor who has no notice by stipulation or otherwise of the application of
the Act, and administrative enforcement action is not taken. If the invitation
to bid on a contract within the scope of the Act includes the stipulations
either directly or by reference, coverage would result since the invitation to
bid becomes a part of the contract.</p><p>(c)   The obligation of a contractor arises on the date when
notice of award is sent to him or her and not on the date the contract is
executed. The necessity of compliance with the representations and stipulations
of the Act is confined to the period in which the contractor is actually
engaged in the performance of work on the contract, including activities
immediately preparatory thereto, provided the records of the contractor
adequately disclose the period during which Government work is being performed.</p>

secondary contractors.</h3>
              <p>(a)   Secondary contractors are covered under the following
circumstances:</p><p>(1)  Where the secondary contractor substitutes for the
prime contractor in performing any of the work which the latter has contracted
to do for the Government, as by (a) manufacturing or furnishing any of the
contract items which the prime contractor has agreed to manufacture or furnish
for the Government, or by (b) producing or supplying any parts, materials, or
services to be used in manufacturing an end product that the prime contractor
has agreed to manufacture for the Government, which parts, materials, or
services it is the regular practice in the industry manufacturing such end
product for the manufacturers to produce or supply themselves rather than to
procure from others; or</p><p>(2)  Where the secondary contractor is a manufacturer of
materials, supplies, articles, or equipment which the Government has contracted
with a regular dealer to furnish, and the dealer causes the manufacturer to
deliver the items directly to the Government either by a direct shipment to the
Government agency as consignee or to the prime contractor’s warehouse or other
designated place where they will be held for the Government and not placed in
regular stock; or</p><p>(3)  Where the secondary contractor, pursuant to a contract
in excess of $10,000 in amount with a Government prime contractor, is engaged
in the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment
which the Government agency has contracted with the prime contractor to procure
for and on behalf of the Government from suppliers thereof, the cost of which
the Government has agreed to pay or reimburse from Government funds; or </p><p>(4)  Where the secondary transports the end product called
for by a covered contract to the Government or where it performs any operation
on the end product, such as weatherproofing or painting; or</p><p>(5)   </p><p>                                             
a.     Where it is the regular practice for manufacturers of
the end product to perform the function assigned to the secondary. Under this
principle, depending on the regular practice in the industry, the Act may be applicable
to a secondary for the manufacture of parts to be incorporated in the end
product, tools and dies to be used in its manufacture, materials used in
packaging the end product, and production-related services, such as engineering
and drafting.</p><p>                                            
b.     If coverage of a secondary turns on regular practice
in an industry, the RD will submit the question to the AA for OWDR for a
ruling, furnishing the following information:</p><p>1.    
Name and address of primary
contractor.</p><p>2.    
Contract number and contracting
agency.</p><p>3.    
Product called for in prime
contract.</p><p>4.    
Name and address of secondary
contractor.</p><p>5.    
A description of the product
supplied or operation performed by the secondary contractor.</p>

              <h3>13b03 - Petroleum dealers
and refiners.</h3>
              <p>(a)   General.</p><p>Contracts in the
petroleum industry may be awarded to a refiner that also operates its own
distribution facilities and makes deliveries pursuant to a PCA contract from
these facilities. In such cases, it is the position of Wage-Hour that the
question of whether such a contractor is a “manufacturer” or “regular dealer”
should be determined upon a realistic evaluation of all pertinent factors such
as the contract itself, the contractor’s operations and the obligations
actually assumed for the fulfillment of the contract requirements. Thus, for
example, where such a refiner is awarded a contract and makes deliveries to the
Government from a central distributing plant of products obtained from its own
refineries, it will be considered to have been awarded the contract as a
refiner and the rules in (b) below will apply to the contract. On the other
hand, if such a refiner makes deliveries to the Government through its own
distribution facilities, but the products are actually received from other
refineries, it will generally be considered to have been awarded the contract
as a dealer and the rules in (c) below will apply. If there is any question as
to whether the refiner is operating as a “manufacturer” or as a “regular dealer”
with respect to a particular contract, and compliance depends on this issue,
the facts shall be obtained and submitted through channels to the RS for
opinion.</p><p>(b)  Refiners.</p><p>If a refiner is
awarded a contract as a manufacturer, only the employees at the refinery are
covered by the PCA. (See R&amp;I No. 3, Sec 40(d).) Consequently, in such cases
truck drivers making deliveries to the Government from bulk stations rather
than from the refinery itself and other bulk station employees performing work
in connection with the delivery of products to the Government are not covered
by the PCA.</p><p>(c)   Dealers.</p><p>(1)  As provided in R&amp;I No. 3, Sec 40(e)(1), where the
contractor is a dealer the PCA applies to employees at the “central
distributing plant” of the dealer who are employed in connection with the
storage and handling of petroleum products prior to delivery to the Government.
A central distributing plant within the meaning of Sec 40(e)(1) is a dealer’s
place or places of business where it initially receives products from its
suppliers which are to be furnished to the Government, where its distribution
operations thereon commence and from which the products are delivered either
directly to the Government or to other plants for such delivery.</p><p>(2)  Depending upon the size and scope of its operations a
dealer may have at least one and sometimes more than one central distributing
plant. For example, where a dealer has only a single establishment and products
are received from suppliers for delivery to the Government from such establishment,
the single establishment constitutes the employer’s central distributing plant.
Similarly, where an employer has two or more establishments at which he or she
initially receives products from his or her suppliers for delivery either
directly to the Government or to other plants for delivery to the Government,
such establishments at which the products are initially received constitute
central distribution plants. Where products are delivered from such a central
distributing plant to other plants of the employer for delivery to the
Government, the latter plants represent “bulk stations” as that term is defined
in R&amp;I No. 3, Sec 40(e)(1).</p><p>(d)  Service station employees.</p><p>R&amp;I No. 3, Sec
40(b)(1) provides that although the PCA stipulations are included in the
contract, such stipulations are inapplicable to employees working at service
stations. As used in this section the term “service stations” includes
establishments, whether owned or operated by the contractor or some other
person, engaged in selling fuel to operators of automotive vehicles, aircraft
and watercraft and is not the same as “gasoline service establishment” as used
in FLSA Sec 3(s)(5) or “gasoline service station” as used in old sec 13(b)(8).</p><p>(e)   Oil production on Government property.</p><p>Employees of a firm
who are engaged in the production of crude oil from wells on property which is
wholly or partially owned by the Government, as in the instance of the Naval
Petroleum Reserve, are producing goods rather than furnishing services and
therefore covered by the PCA.</p>

              <h3>13b08 - Purchase Notice
Agreements.</h3>
              <p>(a)   A Purchase Notice Agreement (PNA) is a written
contract between a supplier and a Government agency under which the supplier
lists its products and offers to sell them to the Government at certain prices.
As needs develop, the agency in turn submits a purchase order to one or another
of the suppliers with whom it has executed such an agreement. Upon receipt of
the order, the supplier fills it either from its existing stocks, by producing
the goods, by purchase from other sources, or by some combination of means.
This type of contract is often used by the Department of Defense to procure
perishable and nonperishable subsistence items, such as dairy products, bakery
products, and canned foods.</p><p>(b)  Purchase Notice Agreements are “contracts” for purpose
of the PCA and the PCA applies as in the case of any other indefinite amount
contract if the aggregate total of purchases (excluding perishables, R&amp;I
No. 3, Sec 11) pursuant to the agreement may exceed $10,000, even though no
single purchase may exceed this amount. Further the “open market” exemption
does not apply in such cases (R&amp;I No. 3, Sec 13).</p><p>(c)   Where, under the PNA, the contractor is providing the
Government with goods which are identifiable as to the time the work on them is
performed, the stock-on-hand rule in Sec 24(a) of R&amp;I No. 3 rather than the
stockpile rule in Sec 24(b) governs. The stock-on-hand rule permits the
contractor to fill the Government order, if it can, from goods produced or
procured prior to the award of its contract. Under it, while the Act does not
apply retroactively to work performed prior to the award of the PNA contract,
it does apply as stated in paragraph (d) following, to work performed after the
date of the award of the PNA contract on the materials or articles supplied to
the Government.</p><p>(d)  All work performed after the Government gives notice
to the contractor of award of the PNA, on goods which the contractor knows or
can anticipate with reasonable certainty at the time the work is done will be
supplied to the Government under the PNA, must be performed in compliance with
the representations and stipulations contained in the Act and incorporated in
the PNA. However, as stated in Sec 22 of R&amp;I No. 3, the necessity of
compliance with the representations and stipulations is confined to the period
of actual engagement in work on the contract, “provided the records of the
contractor adequately disclose the period during which Government work is being
performed”. Thus, if, after notice by the Government of award of a PNA, the
contractor performs work on goods embraced within its terms which the
contractor knows will not be used to fill purchase orders thereunder, the
contractor may perform the work on such goods without the necessity of
compliance with the Act’s stipulations and representations, provided its
records are adequate to segregate such work from Government work. But with
respect to work on any goods which, at the time of performance of such work,
the contractor knows or has reason to believe will be furnished to the
Government in response to purchase orders issued under the PNA, compliance
during the period while such goods are being worked on is required without
regard to whether the purchase order under which the goods will actually be
furnished to the Government has been issued.</p><p>(e)   It will be noted that under paragraph (d) the date of
award for purposes of the stock-on-hand rule is the date of award of the PNA
rather than of the particular purchase order under it. As provided in Sec 22 of
R&amp;I No. 3, compliance with the representations and stipulations of the Act
and regulations is required during all of “the period in which the contractor
is actually engaged in the performance of work on the contract”. The period in
which the contractor is so engaged will necessarily include any period after
issuance of a purchase order under the PNA during which work is performed on
the specific goods supplied under that purchase order. The reason for this,
however, is not because the date of the purchase order, rather than the date of
the PNA, is the date of the award of the contract. The controlling factor is
that at such time there can be no room for doubt that the contractor is
actually engaged in the performance of work “on the contract” embodied in the
PNA. With respect to work done on goods after notice of the PNA but before issuance
of the purchase order which is filled with such goods, a careful evaluation of
all the facts should be made to determine whether the contractor actually knew
or could anticipate with reasonable certainty at the time such work was
performed that the goods worked on would be supplied to the Government under
the PNA.</p><p>(f)   In any case when the application of this instruction
is not clear, the matter shall be submitted through channels to the RS for
opinion. Because of the complex issues, the Field should proceed very carefully
in cases involving PNA’s.</p>

              <p>The trucking of coal,
destined for the Federal Government under a prime contract subject to PCA, is
covered by the PCA regardless of whether the trucking is performed by employees
of the primary contractor or by employees of an independent secondary
contractor. Since the coal being transported is destined for the Government, an
independent secondary contractor is engaged in the manufacturing or furnishing
of the very items which the prime contractor has agreed to manufacture or

operation of a job corps camp or facility. However, secondary contracts let by
the contractor for those materials, supplies, etc., necessary to such
facilities, and which the operator is authorized to procure for or on behalf of
the Government, may be subject to the PCA if the tests for coverage are met.
Such contracts awarded for or on behalf of the job corps camp or facility by
its operating contractor will be subject to the Act to the same extent and

              <h3>13c00 - Convict labor -
prospective parolees.</h3>
              <p>(a)   The term “convict labor”, as used in Sec 1(d) of the
PCA, does not preclude employment on a covered PCA contract of persons who are
permitted to leave prison prior to the end of a sentence or prior to official
parole and establish residence (including residence in a so-called “Half-Way
House”) and obtain employment in the open market at the regular wages for the
work performed. This would be true even though residence and employment
conditions are closely supervised under a State or Federally sponsored system.
The employment must be voluntary (i.e., not “forced” employment in connection
with rehabilitation) and earnings must be retained by the employee.</p><p>(b)  Where “convict labor” is used on a covered PCA
contract that satisfies the provisions of Sec 1761(c) of Title 18, United
States Code, the prohibition in Sec 1(d) of the PCA does not apply. Sec 1761(c)
permits the employment of convicts or prisoners participating in a program of
pilot projects designated by the Office of Justice Assistance, Research, and
Statistics of the U.S. Department of Justice who:</p><p>(1)  receive wages at rates not less than that paid for
work of a similar nature in the locality in which the work is to be performed.
Such wages may be subject to deductions not to exceed 80% of gross wages and
shall be limited to:</p><p>                                             
a.     taxes (Federal, State, local);</p><p>                                            
b.     reasonable charges for room and board as determined by
regulations issued by the chief State correctional officer;</p><p>                                             
c.     allocations for support of family pursuant to State
law, court order, or agreement by the offender;</p><p>                                            
d.     contribution to any fund established by law to
compensate victims of crime of not more than 20% of gross wages but not less
than 5% of gross wages;</p><p>(2)  have not solely by their status as offenders been
deprived of the right to participate in benefits made available by Federal or
State Government to other individuals on the basis of their employment, such as
worker’s compensation. However, such convicts or prisoners shall not be
qualified to receive unemployment compensation while incarcerated;</p><p>(3)  have participated in such employment voluntarily and
agreed in advance to the above specific deductions from gross wages and all
other financial arrangements as a result of participation in such employment.</p><p>(c)   Moreover, the term “convict labor” does not apply
where Federal prisoners are released under the terms of the Prisoner
Rehabilitation Act of 1965 (18 U.S.C. 4082), or under a comparable State
rehabilitation program, to work in the community. Under this arrangement,
prisoners are permitted to work in part of a day at regular employment and
return to custody at the end of the workday, provided:</p><p>(1)  the prisoner is paid or is in an approved work
training program on a voluntary basis;</p><p>(2)  representatives of local union central bodies or
similar labor union organizations have been consulted;</p><p>(3)  such employment does not displace other workers, or be
applied in skills, crafts, or trades in which there is a surplus of available
gainful labor in the locality, or impair existing contracts for services; and</p><p>(4)  the rates of pay and other conditions of employment
will not be less than those paid or provided for work of a similar nature in
the locality where the work is to be performed. The employment must meet the
PCA MW and OT standards.</p><p>(d)  Executive Order 11755, dated December 29, 1973, also
permits the employment of non-Federal prisoners under the same conditions set
forth in subsection (c) above.</p><p>(e)   The Department of Justice is responsible for
administering the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1761(c), 18 U.S.C. 4082, and
Executive Order 11755. Therefore, questions or complaints pertaining to the
above provisions should be directed to the local U.S. Attorney’s Office.</p>

fluctuating w/w under PCA.</h3>
              <p>An employer may
compensate employees who are subject to the PCA on the basis of the fluctuating
w/w method of payment provided that all of the criteria set forth in IB 778.114
are met, which includes the requirement that additional half-time OT be paid
for hours of work in excess of 40 per week. (Note: Work performed prior to
1/1/86 on contracts covered by PCA is subject to OT pay at time and one-half
for all hours worked in excess of eight in a day or 40 per week, whichever are
greater. PCA was amended by Public Law 99-145, effective 1/1/86, to eliminate
the daily OT provisions. Thus, employees paid on a fluctuating w/w basis under
PCA prior to 1/1/86 must receive OT pay for hours of work in excess of 8 per
day rather than 40 per week if the hours over 8/day are greater than the hours
over 40/week.)</p>
