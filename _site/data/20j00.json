  "title": "20j00 - Enforcement\npolicy for computing BW when the employer is subject to Sec 7(m), 13(h), (i),\nand (j) exemptions.",
  "text": "(a)  \nWhen an employer\nhas failed to pay OT specifically required by Sec 7(a) but could have properly\napplied any of the above exemptions to the period when no OT was paid, care\nmust be taken in determining the extent of liability to assure that he/she is\nnot given an advantage in applying the exemption retroactively that would not\nhave been available to an employer who conscientiously applied the exemption\neach week as he/she went along. For this reason, WH will be guided by the\nfollowing in enforcing the Act: (1) \nIf the employer\nhas available during a particular investigation period year any of the\nexemptions, but has failed to post the required notice of exemption and has\nfailed to keep the records as required in Reg 516, Subpart B, it will be\nassumed that he has claimed as exempt weeks the first 14 weeks in the year in\nwhich the establishment engaged in operations subject to the exemption and in\nwhich the employer did not pay OT compensation for hours over 40 in a week. If\nin any of these first 14 weeks of OT any employee has worked in excess of 10\nhours a day or 48 hours in week, without receiving OT pay, BW shall be sought\nin these weeks for the employee for hours in excess of 10 or 48 in those weeks.\nSuch weeks will be counted as weeks of exemption. Of course, when the exempt\nweeks are used up, OT is due for hours worked in excess of 40 in all remaining\nweeks in the calendar year. (See also FOH 32a01.) (2) \nThe calendar year\n(or period of 52 consecutive weeks) is used in determining the weeks of\nexemption irrespective of the fact that some part of a calendar year (or\nperiod) may fall outside a 2-year investigation period. While the Statute of\nLimitations may preclude a request for BW for more than a 2-year period of\ntime, it has no application insofar as the selection of the exempt w/w’s is\nconcerned. Thus, if a 2-year investigation period started in the latter part of\nthe calendar year or period, it is possible that all (or some) of the weeks of\nexemption for that year or period were used up before the investigation period\nstarted, and no more weeks (or fewer than the specified number of weeks) are\navailable for the balance of that year or period. (b)  The policy regarding BW contained in\nFOH 32a01(b) is also applicable to Secs 7(m), 13(h), (i), and (j).",
