  "text": "(a)   29 CFR § 5.5(a)(l)(i) and FAR § 52.222-6(b)(2) require\nthat contributions to fringe benefit plans made by a contractor or\nsubcontractor must be made on a regular basis, i.e., not less often than\nquarterly. (b)  Normally, contributions made to a fringe benefit plan\nfor Government work generally may not be used to fund the plan for periods of\nnon-government work. (See also FOH 15f12(b).) (c)   A contractor must make payments or incur costs in the\namount specified in the applicable WD for each individual laborer or mechanic\nperforming covered contract work. Where the cash wages paid and the per hour\ncost equivalents for fringe benefits together do not equal the sum of the\nprevailing wage rate and fringe benefit amounts set forth in the applicable WD,\nthe balance due must be paid in cash to each of the employees underpaid. NOTE:\nWhere a fringe benefit includes a percentage, compliance will be achieved by\ncomputation of the percentage stated times the basic wage rate. (d)  Contractors and subcontractors are required to pay\nfringe benefits for all DBRA covered work in the w/w. Unlike SCA, fringe\nbenefits for D-B must be paid for both ST and OT hours. However, fringe benefit\npayments are not included in the basic/regular rate of pay for CWHSSA OT\npurposes. (See also FOH l5k06.) (e)   A contractor may take credit for contributions for any\n“bona fide” fringe benefits regardless of whether the particular benefit is\nlisted on the applicable WD. (f)   The contractor is under no obligation to obtain the\nemployee’s concurrence before contributing to the fringe benefit plan on his or\nher behalf. (g)   Fringe benefits must be “bona fide”. There is no\ndifficulty in determining whether a particular fringe benefit is “bona fide” in\nthe ordinary case where the benefits are those common to the construction\nindustry and which are paid directly to the employees in cash or into a fund,\nplan or program. An example of the latter would be the types of benefits listed\nin the Act itself which are funded under a trust or insurance program.\nContractors may take credit for contributions made under such conventional\nplans without requesting the approval of DOL under 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(1)(iv). (h)  Where a particular fringe benefit or benefit plan is\nnot of the conventional type described in the preceding paragraph (f), it will\nbe necessary for the NO to examine the facts and circumstances involved to\ndetermine whether the fringe benefit or the plan is “bona fide” in accordance\nwith the requirements of the Act. This is particularly true with respect to\nunfunded plans, which are discussed in 29 CFR § 5.28. Contractors or\nsubcontractors seeking credit under the Act for costs incurred for such plans\nmust request specific permission from W-H under 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(l)(iv). A contractor may not take\ncredit for any benefit required by law, such as social security contributions\nor workers compensation.",
