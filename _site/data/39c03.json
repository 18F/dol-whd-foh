  "text": "(a)   Worksite An employee’s\nworksite is ordinarily the site the employee reports to, or from which the\nemployee’s work is assigned.  A worksite can refer to a simple location, a\ngroup of buildings, such as a campus or industrial park, or to separate\nfacilities in geographic proximity to one another.  The 75 miles are measured\nfrom the employee’s worksite by surface miles using surface transportation over\npublic streets, roads, highways and waterways by the shortest route possible.  If\nsurface transportation is not available between worksites, the distance is\nmeasured by the most frequently used mode of transportation. 29 CFR 825.111(a)\n- (b) (b)   No fixed\nworksite For employees with no\nfixed worksite, such as in the case for many construction workers,\ntransportation workers, and salespersons, the site to which they report, from\nwhich their work is assigned, or the location to which they are assigned as\ntheir home base, is their worksite.  An employee’s personal residence is not a\nworksite.  In the case of employees who work from home under “telework” or\n“flexi place arrangements” or others such as salespersons who may leave to work\nfrom home and return to their residence, their worksite is the office to which\nthey report or from which their assignments are made.  If 50 employees are\nemployed within 75 miles from the employee’s official worksite, the employee meets\nthe requirements for that test, regardless of where the employee is currently\nperforming his or her duties. 29 CFR 825.111(a)(2) (c)   Public\nagency employees (1)  A State or\npolitical subdivision of a State constitutes a single public agency for\npurposes of determining employee eligibility.  For example, a State is a\nsingle employer, a county is a single employer, a city is a single employer.  The\ndefinition of “employee” does not include an individual who holds public\nelective office in the State, is selected by an officeholder to be a member of\nhis or her personal staff, is appointed by an officeholder to serve on a\npolicymaking level, is an immediate adviser to an officeholder with respect to\nlegal powers, or is an employee in the legislative branch or body of the State\nand is not employed by the legislative library.  Such employees are not\neligible for FMLA benefits and should not be counted in determining the number\nof employees within 75 miles at the worksite of the employee requesting FMLA\nleave. 29 CFR 825.108(c)WHD Non-Administrator Letter FMLA-28 January\n31, 1994 (2)  The U.S.\nGovernment constitutes a single employer for purposes of determining employee\neligibility. 29 CFR 825.10929 C.F.R. 825.102 (d)   Teachers Educational employees\nwho are employed permanently or who are under contract are considered “on the\npayroll” during any portion of the year when school is not in session and are\ncounted when determining the number of employees at a worksite. 29 CFR 825.111(c)",
