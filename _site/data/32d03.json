Such payments may be made, for example, as a certain number of\ncents per hour or as a percentage of the hourly rate. Such payments may be\nexcluded from the regular rate under Sec 7(e)(2) provided (1) they represent\nbona fide fringe benefits, (2) they are the cash equivalent of such benefits,\nand (3) there is a clear understanding between the employer and employees that\nthe payments are in lieu of such fringe benefits. There should also be a\ndesignation on the payroll records that such payments are in lieu of the\nspecific fringe benefits. However, the absence of such a designation per se\nwill not cause such otherwise bona fide fringe payments to be considered part\nof the regular rate provided in fact that the tests set forth above are met.",
