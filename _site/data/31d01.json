  "text": "(a)  \nEmployees of these group homes may\nhave regularly scheduled off-duty periods during the day (for which they are\nnot paid) which might ordinarily break a continuous tour of duty of 24 hours or\nmore. Therefore, a question arises as to whether their sleep time can be\ndeducted from working time. (b)  \nFull-time houseparents. The\nfacilities in question employ houseparents, as well as relief staff in many\ncases, to provide custodial care for individuals who reside at the facilities.\nThe houseparents sleep overnight, sometimes as many as 5 or 6 days in a row,\nafter which they get a day or 2 off. In addition, the houseparents may also\nhave several hours off each afternoon, when they are free to do whatever they\nchoose, including leaving the premises. They sleep in private quarters separate\nfrom the residents of the group home. Many of these houseparents maintain\npermanent residences elsewhere in the community, but others have as their only\nresidence the facility for the mentally retarded. Where such full-time house\nparents meet the standards set forth in FOH 31b20, they are considered to be\nresiding on the premises in accordance with IB 785.23. Therefore, the sleeptime\nrules in IB 785.22 and .23 will be applied. (c)  \nRelief employees. (1)  The relief staff may stay overnight at a facility for\none or more nights a week. During a 24-hour period, these employees may also\nhave regularly scheduled off-duty time during the day with complete freedom\nfrom all responsibilities. They, too, sleep in private quarters separate from\nthe residents of the group home. (2)  In situations where a community residence employs at\nleast one employee who resides on the employer’s premises “for extended periods\nof time” (see FOH 31b20 and IB 785.23), the employer and a relief employee who\nperforms essentially the same duties as such full-time employee may enter into\na “reasonable agreement” (see FOH 31(b)(18)(b)) to hours worked. Such an\nagreement, entered into in advance of the performance of any work, may provide\nthat sleeping time of up to 8 hours can be excluded from compensable hours of\nwork, regardless of the length of the tour of duty involved. Also, a mutually\nagreed-upon amount of off-duty time, during which the employee is completely\nfree from all responsibilities, can be excluded from compensable hours of work.\nSince the residents of such facilities are usually on the premises all day on\nweekends, the hours worked by weekend relief employees may be significantly\nlonger than the hours worked by the employees who work weekdays. Agreements\nwith weekend employees must reflect such differences.",
