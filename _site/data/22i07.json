  "text": "A\nProduct Technology and Marketing Analyst (PTA) who worked for a firm that\nprovides products and services to prevent soil erosion and strengthen retaining\nwalls and foundations of parking lots, bridges, levees, and buildings was found\nto be an exempt administrative employee.  The\nPTA’s primary responsibility was to work independently with the company’s\nEngineering and Design Group (EDG) to develop tests that measure the\nperformance of new products and assess the feasibility of novel uses of current\nproducts.  For example, if an existing product has the potential to\nstabilize and reinforce the lining of coal mine tunnels in a remote region, the\nPTA reviews all relevant information regarding the environmental conditions and\nthe features of the mine.  The PTA then works with the EDG to develop a\ntest to measure the product’s performance under varying conditions.  The\nPTA evaluates numerous factors, including the type of equipment needed to\ncreate the precise environmental conditions and accurately capture the test\nresults.  Approximately 40 percent of the PTA’s working time is spent with\nthe EDG on tests for new and existing products.Additionally,\napproximately 30 percent of the PTA’s time is spent as a liaison to the\ncompany’s sales professionals, who visit potential and current customers. \nDuring these visits, the sales professionals are confronted with questions from\ncustomers regarding specific features/uses of the company’s products and how\nthey compare to competing products.  The sales professionals rely on the\nPTA to provide them guidance on the appropriate responses to these customer\ninquiries.  The PTA independently reaches conclusions regarding testing\nmethodology, testing results, and product performance that allow the company to\nsecure product sales by demonstrating that the company’s products meet customer\nspecifications or are superior to competing products.   The\nremainder of the PTA’s time is spent performing standardized tests on the\ncompany’s products and preparing reports reflecting the test results and how\nthey compare to competitors.  The PTA reports directly to the company’s\nVice President of Process and Product Development.  The PTA receives at\nleast $455 per week on a salary basis. The\nPTA’s duty of working with the EDG to develop tests that measure the\nperformance of new products and assess the feasibility of novel uses of current\nproducts directly relates to the functional areas of quality control and\nresearch.  The PTA’s duty of performing standardized tests on company\nproducts and preparing reports on how those products compare to competitors’\nproducts also directly relates to the functional area of research.  Other\nduties, including assisting sales representatives in responding to customer\nquestions regarding specific features/uses of the company’s products, and\nevaluating product features for potential customers, directly relate to the\nfunctional area of marketing.  Therefore, the PTA’s primary duties involve\nthe “performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management\nor general business operations of the employer or the employer’s\ncustomers.”   Section\n541.202(b) sets out several factors to consider when determining whether an\nemployee exercises discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters\nof significance. Examples of duties indicating the PTA “carries out major\nassignments in conducting the operations of the business” include working\nindependently with the EDG to develop tests that measure performance of the\ncompany’s new products and assess the feasibility of novel uses of the\ncompany’s current products.  Also, in determining how specific\nfeatures/uses of the company’s products compare to competing products,\nevaluating features within the context of scenarios posed by sales\nprofessionals working in the field with customers, and making important\nconclusions that allow the company to secure product sales, the PTA “performs\nwork that affects business operations to a substantial\ndegree.” Accordingly, the PTA’s primary duties “include the exercise of\ndiscretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of\nsignificance.”  See FOH 22i00. WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2008-03 29\nCFR § 541.200(a)(2)29\nCFR § 541.202(b)69\nFR 22122 69\nFR 22144 29\nCFR § 541.200(a)(3)",
