  "text": "(a)   Coverage is extended to construction contracts awarded\ndirectly by the Federal government or financially assisted under any statute\nreferencing D-B labor standards, including but not limited to those listed in\n29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. However, if a statute authorizes assistance but does not\ninclude either directly or by reference aD-B labor standards clause, the DBRA\ndoes not apply. (See (b) below.) (b)  In situations where a project is funded under a number\nof Federal statutes, DBRA applies to the project if any one of the statutes\nauthorizing a portion of the financial assistance requires payment of Davis\nBacon wages. To verify coverage under various DBRA contracts, contact the\nRegional Wage Specialist (RWS). (c)   The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (Pub.\nL. 97-424), effective January 6, 1983, expanded D-B coverage to all Federal-aid\nhighway construction projects to include those involving resurfacing,\nrestoration, rehabilitation, and reconstruction (“4-R” work). Previously,\nSection 113 of Title 23, U.S.C., The Federal-Aid Highway Act, had been\nconstrued to exclude 4-R work from “initial construction.” (d)  The $2,000 threshold for coverage pertains to the\namount of the prime contract, not to the amount of individual subcontracts. If\nthe prime contract exceeds $2,000, all work on the project is covered.",
