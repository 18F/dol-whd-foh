  "text": "COs may find in the payroll records a single\nfigure (either daily or weekly) which represents the total hours actually\nworked plus one-half of the OT hours, in lieu of separate entries for\nstraight-time and OT hours of work. This is particularly so where machine\nposting methods are used. For example, if an employee works 50 hours in the\nworkweek and is entitled to OT pay after 40 hours, the “boosted hour” posting\nwill be 55 hours. The recordkeeping requirements are met in the case of hourly\nrate employees by an entry showing “boosted hours”, provided the payroll or\nother records contain sufficient information so that it is possible, with a\nreasonable amount of recomputation, to ascertain weekly straight-time earnings\nand weekly compensation for OT. Such information includes: (1)  actual hours\nworked, (2)  regular hourly\nrate of pay, (3)  additions to or\ndeductions from wages, and (4)  total wages\npaid.",
