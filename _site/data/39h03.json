  "text": "(a)   Medical\ncertification (1)  If an employee\nfails to provide certification in a timely manner for foreseeable leave, an\nemployer may deny FMLA coverage for the leave until the required certification\nis provided. For example, if an employee is given 15 days to provide\ncertification and does not provide certification for 45 days without sufficient\nreason for the delay, the employer may deny FMLA protections for the period\nfollowing expiration of the 15-day time period, i.e., from day 16 through day\n45. (2)  In the case of\nunforeseeable leave, an employer may deny FMLA coverage for the requested leave\nif the employee fails to provide a certification within 15 calendar days from\nreceipt of the request for certification unless not practicable due to\nextenuating circumstances.  If the employee fails to timely return the\ncertification, the employer can deny FMLA protections for the leave following\nthe expiration of the 15-day time period until a sufficient certification is\nprovided. (3)  If the employee\nnever produces the certification, the leave is not FMLA leave. (b)   Recertification If an employee fails\nto provide a recertification within the time requested by the employer (which\nmust be at least 15 calendar days) or as soon as practicable under the\ncircumstances, then the employer may deny continuation of the FMLA leave\nprotections until the employee produces a sufficient recertification.  If the\nemployee never produces the recertification, the leave is not FMLA leave. (c)   Fitness-for-duty\ncertification An employer may delay\nemployment restoration until an employee submits a required fitness-for-duty\ncertification unless the employer has failed to provide the proper\nnotification.  If the employee never submits the fitness-for-duty certification\nor a new medical certification, the employee may be terminated. 29 CFR 825.313",
