  "text": "(a)   Reg 870.10 sets the maximum part of disposable\nearnings that may be subjected to consumer debt garnishment for weekly and other\nthan weekly pay periods. Where an individual’s pay period is longer than a week\n(e.g., biweekly, semi-monthly, monthly, etc.,) the earnings that may be subjected\nto garnishment are not dependent on the earnings or restrictions in any\nparticular w/w. They are determined by the amount earned up to the point when\nthe garnishee (usually the employer) is legally bound to make deductions from\nsuch earnings pursuant to a garnishment, regardless of pay period length. (See\nchart in FOH 16b00(a).) (b)  Examples: (1)       \nAn employee with a biweekly pay\nperiod works and is paid the following: \n\n\n \n  \n  1st \n  week\n  \n  \n  2nd week\n  \n  \n  Total\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  Worked 5\n  days -- $500.00\n  \n  \n  Worked 1\n  day -- $100.00\n  \n  \n  $600.00\n  \n \n \n  \n  Less\n  Legally Required Deductions\n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  $100.00\n  \n \n \n  \n  Disposable\n  Income\n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  $500.00\n  \n \n\n\n In this example, $125.00 is garnishable for consumer debts.\nIt does not matter that the employee’s disposable earnings for the second w/w\nwere less than $154.50, because the employer pays on a biweekly basis. In order\nfor any consumer garnishment to take place in a 2-week pay period, disposable\nincome must be greater than $309.00. In a biweekly pay period, when disposable\nearnings are between $309.00 and $412.00, only the amount in excess of $309.00\nis subject to such garnishment. When the disposable earnings are in excess of\n$412.00, as in the above example, up to 25% of the biweekly disposable earnings\nmay be garnished for consumer debts. (See FOH 16b00(a).) (2) \nA company pays on a semi-monthly\nbasis. Pay periods run from the 1st through the 15th and the 16th  through the\nend of the month. The employer pays employees in full on the last day of the\npay period. The firm is served with a garnishment on the 17th. The debtor\nemployee has accrued two day’s disposable earnings in the amount of $200.00. No\nwages would be subject to garnishment at this time, because in a semimonthly pay\nperiod disposable earnings must be greater than $334.75 for any garnishment to\ntake place. (See FOH 16b00(a).) The employee’s disposable earnings in any\nparticular w/w are not material. Therefore, in those states that do not allow\nthe garnishment of future earnings, the employer could not withhold on a\ngarnishment order issued that day. The garnishment amount will be recomputed on\nall wages for the period, if another garnishment is served at the end of the\npay period. (c)   The restrictions of sec 303 are applicable to the pay\nperiod of the individual whose earnings are subjected to garnishment. Where\nthere is a hold-back period for wages earned, the multiple limitations\nprescribed in the Statute and Reg 870.10 are applied separately to the earnings\nfor each pay period. Earnings for two or more pay periods are not lumped\ntogether. (d)  Sec 302(a) of the CCPA states “[t]he term ‘earnings’\nmeans compensation paid or payable for personal services, whether denominated\nas wages, salary, commission, bonus, or otherwise, and includes periodic\npayments pursuant to a pension or retirement program. ” The statutory definition\ngenerally embraces compensation for personal services. When the employment contract\nprovides furnished facilities, such as meals and lodging, the dollar value of\nthe furnished facilities is part of the earnings and must be considered in\napplying the restrictions of sec. 303(a). (e)   The Supreme Court has held that the statutory terms\n“earnings” and “disposable earnings” are, for the purposes of the CCPA,\ngenerally confined to periodic payments of compensation. They do not pertain to\nevery asset that is traceable in some way to such compensation. (Kokoszka v. Belford,\n417 US 642 (1974).) Under this decision, certain lump sum payments, such as tax\nrefunds, are neither periodic payments, nor subject to the limitations imposed\nby the CCPA. The treatment of lump sum severance or pension payments is not\nclear and contact should be made with the NO/OEP/FMLA Team with the facts\ninvolved prior to making a final determination for any particular case. It is\nWH’s position that bonuses are considered “earnings” for the pay period in\nwhich they are received, and subject to the limits on garnishment.",
