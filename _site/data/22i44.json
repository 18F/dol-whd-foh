  "text": "School\nResource Officers (SROs) employed at an independent school district qualified\nfor the administrative exemption. The\nSROs’ primary duty was to provide for the safety and security of the students,\nstaff, and property within the school system by planning to prevent safety and\nsecurity problems and by responding immediately to deal with any disruption or\ncriminal activity.  Among their qualifications, SROs were licensed\npursuant to the state’s Peace Officer’s Standards and Training\nCertification.  The SROs’ duties included providing consulting advice to\nschool administrators on plans for safety, emergency preparedness, traffic\nflow, evacuation, lighting, and video surveillance, as well as other\nsafety/security issues; providing training to students, faculty,\nadministrators, and parent groups regarding safety issues, such as personal\nsafety, gun safety, bus safety, and drug and gang awareness; coordinating\nsecurity for extracurricular events; serving as liaison/facilitator between the\nschool system and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate the law\nenforcement efforts of the local jurisdiction with regard to the schools, and\nto develop a communication network between administration, staff, students and\nparents within the “cluster” schools; creating and maintaining written case\nfiles of criminal acts by students and reports of deprived, abused, or\nneglected children and sharing this information with the school administrator,\nschool social worker, agencies in the law enforcement and judiciary systems,\nand the local family and children’s services department, when appropriate;\nadvising regarding what law enforcement measures are appropriate when the\nschool administrator or SRO believes an incident is a violation of the law;\ninvestigating suspected criminal activity on school property; and making\narrests on school property.   In\nperforming the duties above, the SRO decided whether a situation requires\nimmediate action, whether to charge a violation, whether to make an arrest, and\nwhether to refer a case to the district attorney for prosecution.  The SRO\nindependently determined and planned his or her daily work schedules (e.g.,\nwhether to visit a particular school at a particular time and what to do at\nthat location).  In addition, the SRO’s recommendations to faculty and\nstaff were usually implemented (e.g., advice on fire drills, lighting,\nlandscaping, traffic flow, safety, and emergency preparedness plans).  The\nSRO also provided training to faculty, staff, and students and made purchases\non behalf of the school (e.g., buying safety equipment). Each\nSRO had an office at a high school and served as the Resource Officer for a\ncluster of schools, typically a high school and five to seven feeder middle and\nelementary schools.  An SRO’s typical work day consisted of working in an\noffice at a high school writing reports or performing similar desk work,\nperforming training, providing advice to faculty and staff, working in the\nfield patrolling, and doing investigative work.  The field work was\nincidental to the SRO’s primary duty, which is office work, and did not require\nphysical stamina or repetitive movements.  The SRO was minimally\nsupervised by the Manager of Safety and Security.  Moreover, in certain\ncases, some of the cluster schools may employ security guards, but the SRO has\nno direct supervisory responsibility over the security guards in such\ncases.  The SRO has an annual discretionary budget of $15,000 to $20,000\nfor purchasing safety/security related items, such as cameras and traffic\nsafety cones.  Purchase orders above the discretionary budget require\nsupervisory approval.  The SROs are paid at least $455 per week on a\nsalary basis. The\nSROs performed office or non-manual work because an SRO’s typical work day\nconsisted of working in an office writing reports or performing similar\ndeskwork, performing training, and providing recommendations and advice to\nfaculty and staff.  In addition, any field work performed by the SRO is\nincidental to the SRO’s primary duty, which was office work, and did not\nrequire physical stamina or repetitive movements.  The SROs’ primary duty\nof providing for the safety and security of the students, staff, and property\nwithin the school system by planning to prevent safety and security problems and\nby responding immediately to deal with any disruption or criminal activity,\nwhich may include, for example, providing consulting advice to school\nadministrators on plans for safety, emergency preparedness, traffic flow,\nevacuation, lighting, and video surveillance and providing training to\nstudents, faculty, administrators, and parent groups regarding safety-related\nissues, directly related to the functional areas of safety and health discussed\nin 29 CFR § 541.201(b).  The\nSROs’ employers were public educational entities rather than police departments\nor security companies whose primary operations were law enforcement and\nsecurity, and as a result, the SROs’ activities could not be categorized as\nproduction operations for their employers.  Therefore, the SROs’ primary\nduty involved the “performance of office or non-manual work directly related to\nthe management or general business operations of the employer.”  29 CFR\n§ 541.200(a)(2). The\nprimary duty of the SRO’s described above “includes the exercise of discretion\nand independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.”  29 CFR\n§ 541.200(a)(3).  The SRO is minimally supervised.  The SRO has\nan annual discretionary budget of $15,000 to $20,000 for purchasing\nsafety/security related items. Such duties as providing the extensive\nrecommendations and advice noted above to faculty and staff that are usually\nimplemented satisfy one of the regulatory factors in 29 CFR § 541.202(b)\nfor determining whether an employee exercises discretion and independent\njudgment with respect to matters of significance, specifically, that the\n“employee provide consultation or expert advice to management.” In addition, by\nserving as a liaison/facilitator between the school system and local law\nenforcement agencies to coordinate the law enforcement efforts of the local\njurisdiction relative to the schools, and to develop a communication network\nbetween administration, staff, students, and parents within the cluster\nschools, the SRO formulates and implements management policies or operating\npractices. See 29 CFR § 541.202(b). See FOH 22i00. WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2007-08",
