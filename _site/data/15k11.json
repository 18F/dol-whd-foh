  "text": "(a)   The following examples reflect the correct\ncomputations under DBRA and CWHSSA for an employee who worked 44 hours on a\ncovered contract as an electrician, where the wage determination rate for an\nelectrician is $12.00 (basic hourly rate) plus $2.50 in fringe benefits. (1) \nIf the employer paid $12.00 in\ncash wages and $2.50 in fringe benefits, the electrician would receive \n\n\n \n  \n  44 hours\n  x $2.50 = $111.00 in fringe benefits\n  44 hours\n  x $2.50 = $528.00 for prevailing wages\n  4 hours\n  x ½ x $12.00 = $24.00 in CWHSSA earnings\n  \n \n \n  \n  $662.00\n  Total\n  \n \n\n\n (2) \nIf the employer paid $10.00 in\ncash wages and $4.50 in fringe benefits: \n\n\n \n  \n  44 hours\n  x $4.50 = $198.00 in fringe benefits\n  44 hours\n  x $10.00 = $440.00 for prevailing wages\n  4 hours\n  x ½ x $12.00 = $24.00 in CWHSSA earnings\n  \n \n \n  \n  $662.00\n  Total\n  \n \n\n\n (b)  The following examples provide two methods for the\ncomputation of overtime premium pay required under CWHSSA and/or FLSA for an\nemployee who worked in different job classifications and at different rates of\npay in the same work week: An employee is hired to\nperform work on a covered construction contract in two job classifications:\npainter and electrician. The wage determination rate for an electrician is\n$12.00 (basic hourly rate) plus $2.50 in fringe benefits. The wage\ndetermination rate for a painter is $10.00 (basic hourly rate) plus $3.00 in\nfringe benefits. The payroll shows that the worker performed painting and\nelectrical duties as follows:  \n\n\n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  S\n  \n  \n  M\n  \n  \n  T\n  \n  \n  W\n  \n  \n  T\n  \n  \n  F\n  \n  \n  S\n  \n \n \n  \n  Painter\n  Hours\n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  8\n  \n  \n  8\n  \n  \n  8\n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  Electrician\n  Hours\n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  8\n  \n  \n  8\n  \n  \n  4\n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n\n\n                                                                        (1) \nMethod 1: Computation of the\novertime premium based on the “regular rate” for the work week. Step 1: Determine the straight time wages due;\nexcluding fringe benefits \n\n\n \n  \n  24 hours\n  at the painters rate of $10.00 = $240.00\n  \n \n \n  \n  20 hours\n  at the electricians rate of $12.00 = $240.00\n  \n \n \n  \n  Total\n  straight time wages = $480.00\n  \n \n\n\n Step 2: Calculate the “regular rate” \n\n\n \n  \n  ($480.00 / 44 hours worked)= $10.91 “regular\n  rate”\n  \n \n\n\n Step 3: Compute the overtime premium due \n\n\n \n  \n  ½($10.91)\n  x 4 overtime hours worked = $21.82\n  \n \n\n\n (2) \nMethod 2: Computation of the\novertime premium based on the “rate in effect” when the overtime hours were\nworked (See FOH 15k01): In this example the four overtime hours occurred on a\nSaturday. The overtime premium could be computed as follows: \n\n\n \n  \n  ½($12.00)\n  x 4 = $24\n  \n \n\n\n Note:   In some cases, a question arises over whether\na cash payment made to a laborer or mechanic is paid in lieu of a fringe\nbenefit contribution or whether it is simply part of the individual’s normal\nstraight time wages. In the latter situation, the cash payment is not\nexcludable in computing the overtime pay obligation. (c)   CWHSSA Liquidated Damages. Liquidated damages are\ncomputed at $10.00 per day per employee for CWHSSA violations. Although the contracting\nofficer is required in all violation cases to compute liquidated damages, the\ndecision on whether to assess the damages is made by the federal agency.\n(Liquidated damages in excess of $500 may be waived or adjusted only with the\nconcurrence of the Wage and Hour Division.)  \n\n\n \n  \n  Example:\n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  M\n  \n  \n  T\n  \n  \n  W\n  \n  \n  T\n  \n  \n  F\n  \n  \n  S\n  \n  \n  S\n  \n  \n  Total\n  \n \n \n  \n  Regular\n  Time\n  \n  \n  10\n  \n  \n  12\n  \n  \n  13\n  \n  \n  9\n  \n  \n  8\n  \n  \n  3\n  \n  \n  0\n  \n  \n  55\n  \n \n\n\n In the above example, no\novertime premium was paid. The 15 weekly overtime hours were worked on three\ncalendar days, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Thus, $30.00 in CWHSSA liquidated\ndamages would be computed. (d)  Overtime requirements under the Fair Labor Standards\nAct, as amended. Laborers and mechanics\nperforming work subject to the predetermined minimum wages may be subject to\novertime compensation provisions of other laws which may apply concurrently to\nthem, including the Fair Labor Standards Act. (29 CFR § 778.6.)  As a general standard,\nSection 7(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, provides that an\nemployer shall not employ any employee to work in excess of 40 hours in a\nworkweek unless such employee receives compensation for his or her employment\nin excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half\ntimes the regular rate at which he or she is employed. (29 CFR § 778.101.) Unless specifically\nexempted, an employee who performs work on both federally funded/federally\nfinanced projects and commercial work in the same workweek must receive an\novertime premium for hours worked in excess of 40 in the workweek. (29 CFR §\n5.32 and in 29 CFR Part 778.) CWHSSA requires the payment\nof an overtime premium only if the laborer or mechanic works in excess of 40\nhours in a workweek on covered contract(s). Overtime hours worked, which are\nnot subject to CHWSSA, would be subject to the FLSA, unless otherwise exempted.\nThe distinction is relevant in the assessment of liquidated damages as the FLSA\ndoes not provide for the assessment of liquidated damages.",
