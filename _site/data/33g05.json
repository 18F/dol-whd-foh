  "text": "The\nHOs are designed to be mutually exclusive.  Certain machines, however, may fall\nunder different HOs at different times because their functions can vary, as\nwhen different attachments are used.  For example, a dough mixer prohibited\nunder HO 11 would be prohibited under HO 10 if a meat grinding attachment were\nadded to make hamburger.  Likewise, there may be situations when the illegal\nemployment of a youth will fall under several HOs (e.g., the employment of a\n16-year-old youth in a coal mine, while using a circular saw, would constitute\na violation of HO 3 and HO 14).",
