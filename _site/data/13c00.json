  "text": "(a)   The term “convict labor”, as used in Sec 1(d) of the\nPCA, does not preclude employment on a covered PCA contract of persons who are\npermitted to leave prison prior to the end of a sentence or prior to official\nparole and establish residence (including residence in a so-called “Half-Way\nHouse”) and obtain employment in the open market at the regular wages for the\nwork performed. This would be true even though residence and employment\nconditions are closely supervised under a State or Federally sponsored system.\nThe employment must be voluntary (i.e., not “forced” employment in connection\nwith rehabilitation) and earnings must be retained by the employee. (b)  Where “convict labor” is used on a covered PCA\ncontract that satisfies the provisions of Sec 1761(c) of Title 18, United\nStates Code, the prohibition in Sec 1(d) of the PCA does not apply. Sec 1761(c)\npermits the employment of convicts or prisoners participating in a program of\npilot projects designated by the Office of Justice Assistance, Research, and\nStatistics of the U.S. Department of Justice who: (1)  receive wages at rates not less than that paid for\nwork of a similar nature in the locality in which the work is to be performed.\nSuch wages may be subject to deductions not to exceed 80% of gross wages and\nshall be limited to:                                              \na.     taxes (Federal, State, local);                                             \nb.     reasonable charges for room and board as determined by\nregulations issued by the chief State correctional officer;                                              \nc.     allocations for support of family pursuant to State\nlaw, court order, or agreement by the offender;                                             \nd.     contribution to any fund established by law to\ncompensate victims of crime of not more than 20% of gross wages but not less\nthan 5% of gross wages; (2)  have not solely by their status as offenders been\ndeprived of the right to participate in benefits made available by Federal or\nState Government to other individuals on the basis of their employment, such as\nworker’s compensation. However, such convicts or prisoners shall not be\nqualified to receive unemployment compensation while incarcerated; (3)  have participated in such employment voluntarily and\nagreed in advance to the above specific deductions from gross wages and all\nother financial arrangements as a result of participation in such employment. (c)   Moreover, the term “convict labor” does not apply\nwhere Federal prisoners are released under the terms of the Prisoner\nRehabilitation Act of 1965 (18 U.S.C. 4082), or under a comparable State\nrehabilitation program, to work in the community. Under this arrangement,\nprisoners are permitted to work in part of a day at regular employment and\nreturn to custody at the end of the workday, provided: (1)  the prisoner is paid or is in an approved work\ntraining program on a voluntary basis; (2)  representatives of local union central bodies or\nsimilar labor union organizations have been consulted; (3)  such employment does not displace other workers, or be\napplied in skills, crafts, or trades in which there is a surplus of available\ngainful labor in the locality, or impair existing contracts for services; and (4)  the rates of pay and other conditions of employment\nwill not be less than those paid or provided for work of a similar nature in\nthe locality where the work is to be performed. The employment must meet the\nPCA MW and OT standards. (d)  Executive Order 11755, dated December 29, 1973, also\npermits the employment of non-Federal prisoners under the same conditions set\nforth in subsection (c) above. (e)   The Department of Justice is responsible for\nadministering the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1761(c), 18 U.S.C. 4082, and\nExecutive Order 11755. Therefore, questions or complaints pertaining to the\nabove provisions should be directed to the local U.S. Attorney’s Office.",
