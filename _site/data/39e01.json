  "text": "(a)   General (1)  FMLA leave may\nbe taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule under the following\nconditions: a.     When\nthere is a medical need for leave that can be best accommodated through an\nintermittent or reduced leave schedule for an employee’s own serious health\ncondition, to care for a spouse, parent, son, or daughter with a serious health\ncondition, or to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or\nillness.  Such leave may be necessary for planned and/or unanticipated medical\ntreatment of a serious health condition or of a serious injury or illness of a covered\nservicemember, or during recovery from treatment.  It may also be taken to\nprovide care or psychological comfort to a spouse, parent, son, or daughter\nwith a serious health condition or a covered servicemember with a serious\ninjury or illness.  Examples of medically necessary intermittent leave include: 1.     Leave\ntaken for a condition which requires treatment by a health care provider\nperiodically, rather than for one continuous period of time, and may include\nleave of periods from an hour or more to several weeks, 2.     Leave\ntaken by a pregnant employee for prenatal examinations or for periods of severe\nmorning sickness, 3.     Leave\ntaken for absences where a family member is incapacitated or the employee is unable\nto perform the essential functions of the position intermittently because of a\nchronic serious health condition, even if he or she does not receive treatment\nfrom a health care provider. b.     When\nleave is taken due to a qualifying exigency. (2)  Intermittent\nleave or a reduced leave schedule after the birth of a healthy child or\nplacement of a healthy child for adoption or foster care may only be taken if\nthe employer agrees. 29 USC 2612(b)(1)29 CFR 825.202 (b)   Scheduling\nof leave If an employee needs\nleave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule for planned medical\ntreatment, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment\nso as not to disrupt unduly the employer’s operations. 29 USC 2612(e)(2)29 CFR 825.203 (c)   Transfer\nto an alternate position (1)  If an employee\nneeds intermittent leave that is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment,\nthe employer may require the employee to transfer temporarily, during the\nperiod that the intermittent or reduced leave schedule is required, to an\nalternative position for which the employee is qualified and that better\naccommodates recurring periods of leave. (2)  An employer\nmust provide equivalent pay and benefits in the alternative position, but the\nposition does not have to have equivalent duties.  The employer may increase\nthe pay and benefits of an existing alternative position to make them equivalent\nto those of the employee’s regular job.  Where an employer’s normal practice\nbases benefits on the number of hours worked, the employer may proportionately\nreduce benefits for an employee’s reduced hours worked. (3)  An employer may\nnot transfer an employee to an alternative position in order to discourage the\nemployee from taking leave or otherwise work a hardship on the employee.  See\nFOH 39o. (4)  When an\nemployee no longer needs to continue on intermittent or reduced schedule leave\nand is able to return to full-time work, the employer must place the employee\nin the same or equivalent job as the job the employee left when the leave\ncommenced.  The employee may not be required to take more leave than necessary\nto address the circumstance that precipitated the need for leave. (5)  The FMLA limits\nan employer’s ability to require that an employee transfer to an alternate\nposition to situations involving foreseeable leave for planned medical\ntreatment.  This is the only situation where an employer may require a\ntransfer. 73 FR 67934, 67974-67975 29 USC 2612(b)(2)29 CFR 825.204 (d)   Increments\nof leave (1)  The employer\nmust account for intermittent leave or reduced schedule leave by no greater\nthan the shortest period of time used to account for other forms of leave,\nprovided it is not greater than one hour and does not reduce the employee’s\nFMLA entitlement by more than the amount of leave actually taken.  For example,\nif an employer accounts for the use of annual leave in increments of one hour\nand the use of sick leave in increments of one-half hour, then FMLA leave use\nmust be accounted for using increments no larger than one-half hour.   If the\nemployer accounts for other forms of leave use in increments greater than one\nhour during the period the FMLA leave is taken, the employer must account for\nFMLA leave in increments no greater than one hour.   See FOH 39m02 for special\nrules applicable to airline flight crew employees. (2)  If an employer\nuses varying increments to account for leave usage at different times of the\nday or shift, the employer may not account for FMLA leave in a larger increment\nthan the shortest period used to account for other leave during the period the\nFMLA leave is taken.  For example, if an employer usually accounts for all\ntypes of leave in increments of 15 minutes, but accounts for all non-FMLA leave\nfor the first hour of the day in 30-minute increments, the employer may also\naccount for FMLA leave in an increment no greater than 30 minutes only during\nthe first hour of the day. (3)  Where it is\nphysically impossible for an employee using intermittent leave or working a\nreduced leave schedule to commence or end work mid-way through a shift, the\nentire period that the employee is forced to be absent is designated as FMLA\nleave and counts against the employee’s entitlement.  The “physical\nimpossibility” provision is intended to be narrowly construed and applied only\nin instances of true physical impossibility.  Thus, if the exception applies to\na flight attendant, train conductor, ferry operator, bus driver, or truck\ndriver whose worksite is on board an airplane, train, boat, bus, or truck, or\nto a laboratory technician whose workplace is inside a clean room that must\nremain sealed for a certain period of time, the exception will only apply until\nthe vehicle has returned to the departure site or while the clean room remains\nsealed. 29 CFR 825.205(a)78 FR 886873 FR 67934, 67976 - 67978 (e)   Calculation\nof leave (1)  The employee’s\nactual workweek is the basis for the FMLA entitlement.a.     If\nan employee is normally required to work more than 40 hours per week, the hours\nworked beyond 40 must be included in determining the employee’s leave\nentitlement.  For example, if an employee normally works overtime in three of\nevery four weeks, then such overtime hours are part of the usual and normal\nworkweek schedule of the employee and are included in calculating the FMLA\nentitlement available to the employee. b.     If\novertime hours are not required, or are voluntary, such hours are not counted\nto calculate the employee’s FMLA entitlement and are not counted against the\nemployee’s FMLA entitlement when not worked. 73 FR 67934,\n67978-67979 (2)  The FMLA provides\neligible employees with up to 12 workweeks of leave for qualifying reasons and\nup to 26 workweeks of leave for military caregiver leave.  When an employee\ntakes leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule in periods of less\nthan one full week, only the amount of leave actually taken may be counted\ntoward the employee’s leave entitlement.  An employer may convert fractions of\na workweek to their hourly equivalent so long as the conversion equitably\nreflects the employee’s total hours.  For example, an employee whose actual\nworkweek is always 40 hours per week, is entitled to an hourly equivalent of\n480 hours (12 workweeks × 40 hours per week).  For an employee whose schedule\nvaries from week to week, the hourly equivalent must equitably reflect the\nactual hours that would be worked during each workweek that FMLA leave is\nneeded. (3)  If the\nemployee’s schedule varies from week to week to such an extent that the\nemployer is unable to determine how many hours the employee would have worked\nhad he or she not taken FMLA leave, the employer may use a weekly average of\nthe hours scheduled over the 12 months prior to the period of leave for\ncalculating the employee’s leave entitlement. 29 CFR 825.205(b) and (c)",
