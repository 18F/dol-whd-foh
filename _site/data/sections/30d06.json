  "text": "(a)   Section\n3(m) limits the tip credit an employer may claim to the difference between the\nSec. 6(a)(1) wage and the cash wage paid by the employer. Under this formula,\nthe direct or cash wage paid by employer (which may not be less than $2.13 per\nhour) plus the tip credit (the difference between the Sec. 6(a)(1) wage and the\ncash wage paid) always equal the Sec. 6(a)(1) wage. (b)   Under\nSec. 3(m), the direct wage paid may be comprised of cash, board, lodging, or\nfacilities in accordance with 29 CFR part 531 and FOH 30c.  The tip credit\nequals the difference between the minimum wage and the direct wage paid, which\nmay be comprised of cash, board, lodging, and/or facilities and must be at\nleast $2.13 per hour. (c)   Because\nSec. 3(m) caps a tipped employee’s wage at the minimum wage, an employer that\nclaims a tip credit may not make deductions for non-3(m) costs, such as\nshortages, breakage, cost of uniforms, etc., because any such deduction would\nreduce the tipped employee’s wages below the minimum wage.  Under the FLSA,\nwhen the employer claims a tip credit, the tipped employee is considered to\nhave been paid only the minimum wage for all non-overtime hours worked in a\ntipped occupation (for overtime hours, the regular rate may exceed the minimum\nwage).  Even when an employer pays more than the $2.13 minimum direct wage, the\nemployee will have only received the minimum wage and non-3(m) deductions\ncannot be made.  For example, if an employer pays a direct wage of $3.13, the\ntip credit will be $4.12 and the employee will have only received the minimum\nwage.  Non-3(m) deductions may only be made from a tipped employee’s wages when\nthe employer does not claim a tip credit and pays a direct wage in excess of\nthe minimum wage. Updating Regulations Issued Under the Fair\nLabor Standards Act; Final Rule, 76 FR 18839, April 5, 2011. (d)   Where\nFLSA and a state or local law regulating the amount of tip credit that may be\ntaken by an employer are concurrently applicable, it is the employer’s\nresponsibility to comply with the more protective wage standard.  (Rev. 563,\n12/9/88) (e)   Examples For purposes of these\nexamples, assume: the Sec. 6(a)(1) wage rate is $7.25 per hour; the employee\nworked no overtime hours; the employee meets the Sec. 3(t) definition of tipped\nemployee; the employer properly advised the employee in advance of the\nrequirements outlined in 29 CFR 531.59(b); and that the employer maintained\nappropriate payroll records. (1)  When the state\nor local minimum wage is the same as the Sec. 6(a)(1) wage, the amount of tip\ncredit will vary depending on the cash or direct wage paid to the employee. \nTips in excess of those used toward the tip credit are not considered wages\nunder Sec. 3(m).                                              \na.     If\nthe employer pays a cash wage paid of $2.13 per hour, it may claim a tip credit\nof $5.12 per hour ($7.25 - $2.13).                                              \nb.     If\nthe employer pays a cash wage paid of $3.63 per hour, it may claim a tip credit\nof $3.62 per hour ($7.25 - $3.63).                                              \nc.     If\nthe employer pays a cash wage paid of $4.86 per hour, it may claim a tip credit\nof $2.39 per hour ($7.25 - $4.86).                                              \nd.     If\nthe employer pays a cash wage of less than the minimum required by the FLSA\n($2.13 per hour), it may not claim a tip credit and must pay the difference\nbetween the minimum wage and the cash wage that was paid. For example, if an\nemployer pays a cash wage of $2.00 per hour, it would not be entitled to claim\na tip credit and must pay the difference between the minimum wage and the cash\nwage paid in cash ($5.25 per hour).                                                                                                                                                              \n\n\n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  Federal\n  \n \n \n  \n  Minimum Wage  $7.25\n       \n  Cash Wage  $2.00\n  \n \n \n  \n     \n  Tip Credit  $0.00\n        \n  Wages Due  $5.25\n  \n \n\n\n            Under FLSA, the\nemployee has received only $7.25 per hour and the employer may not make\nnon-3(m) deductions for shortages, breakage, cost of uniforms, etc. (2)  Even when the\nstate or local minimum wage is higher than the Sec. 6(a)(1) wage, the formula\nin section 3(m) still limits the amount of the tip credit the employer may\nclaim to the difference between the cash wage paid and the federal minimum\nwage.  Tips in excess of those used toward the FLSA tip credit are not\nconsidered wages under Sec. 3(m).                                              \na.     The\nstate minimum wage is $7.40 per hour.  The employer pays a cash wage of $2.89\nper hour as required by the state law and claims a tip credit of $4.51 per hour\nas permitted under state law ($7.40 – $2.89).  Under the FLSA, the employer is\nlimited to a tip credit of $4.36 ($7.25 - $2.89).                                                                                                                                                             \n\n\n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  State\n  \n  \n  Federal\n  \n   \n \n \n  \n  Minimum Wage\n       Cash Wage\n  \n  \n  $7.40\n  $2.89\n  \n  \n  $7.25\n  $2.89\n  \n \n \n  \n       Tip Credit\n  \n  \n  $4.51\n  \n  \n  $4.36\n  \n \n\n\n Under FLSA, even\nthough the employer has paid a direct wage in excess of the required minimum of\n$2.13, the employee has received only $7.25 per hour and the employer may not\nmake non-3(m) deductions for shortages, breakage, cost of uniforms, etc.                                              \nb.     The\nstate minimum wage is $8.15 per hour.
