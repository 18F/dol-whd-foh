  "text": "(a)   Generally, the Sec 13(b)(1) exemption is\nlimited to employees of motor carriers (see IB 782.2). However, the Motor\nCarrier Act gives the DOT power to establish qualifications and maximum hours\nof service for drivers employed by non-carriers in situations where the\nnon-carrier leases or rents motor vehicles with such drivers to motor carriers.\nThus, where all other tests for exemption are met, Sec 13(b)(1) is applicable\nto these drivers while they are driving the motor vehicles leased or rented to\nmotor carriers, on the same basis as if they were actually employed by the\ncarriers. (b)   Except as provided in (a) above, Sec\n13(b)(1) does not extend to other safety-affecting employees of the leasing or\nrenting establishment, such as mechanics, unless the employer is a motor\ncarrier in his own right. For example, the employer may conduct his operations\nin such a manner as to be a private carrier, or he may lease or rent motor\nvehicles to a shipper under such conditions that he maintains control and\ndirection over the carrier services performed in which case he would be a\ncontract carrier.",
