  "text": "Name:  Occupations involved in the operation of circular saws, band\nsaws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, and\nabrasive cutting discs. Originally Adopted:  November 15, 1960 (a)  \nScope of HO 14 (1)  HO 14 is broad and embraces the use of circular saws,\nband saws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers,\nand abrasive cutting discs wherever they are used—other than in the industries\nwhere they are already prohibited by earlier HOs.  This HO differs from most\nother HOs in that it recognizes that the above named machines are banned\nirrespective of the specific industry in which they are used or the specific\nmaterials (paper, meat, metal, etc.) upon which they are being used.  The use\nof most saws and shears is prohibited by HOs 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, and 12.  HO 14\nwas issued to “close the gap” and protect youths working in other industries\nwhere such machines are used. a.    \nExamples include: 1.    \nHO 4 prohibits the use of chain\nsaws by minors in logging operations. 2.    \nHO 5 prohibits the use of saws in\nwoodworking operations such as furniture factories and construction sites. 3.    \nHO 8 prohibits the use of\nguillotine shears on metal. 4.    \nHO 10 prohibits the use of saws to\ncut meat and bones. 5.    \nHO 11 prohibits the use of saws to\ncut bakery products. 6.    \nHO 12 prohibits the use of saws\nand shears to cut paper products. (2)  HO 14 became effective before the 1961 and 1966\namendments to the FLSA that made previously noncovered retail stores subject to\nthe child labor provisions.  It was revised by the 2010 Final Rule (see 75 FR\n28404), which added more types of prohibited machines.  Since the scope of HO\n14 is broad, it can be applied to circular saws, band saws, guillotine shears,\nchain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, and abrasive cutting discs found\nin all establishments covered by the FLSA. (3)  Generally, WH will only charge a single violation when\nthe same piece of equipment is prohibited by HO 14 and another HO (such as HO\n5, HO 11, HO 12, etc.) WH normally will apply the provisions of HO 14 whenever\na piece of equipment named in HO 14 is the subject of the violation. For\nexample, wood chippers meet the definition of power-driven woodworking machines\ncontained in § 570.55(b) and therefore are prohibited by HO 5.  But because\nsuch equipment is specifically named in HO 14, and is used in a variety of\nestablishments (saw milling, pallet shops, mulch manufacturing, landscape\nservices, waste disposal and recycling, etc.), WH will generally charge\nviolations regarding the operating and assisting in the operation of wood\nchippers under HO 14. (4)  The scope of this order includes operating, assisting\nto operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or and cleaning the named\nequipment wherever found in a covered establishment. (5)  HO 14 covers only power-driven equipment; any\noccupation that involves only manually operated saws, cutting discs, or shears\n(not power-driven) is outside the scope of the HO. (6)  Definitions a. The term abrasive cutting disc shall mean a machine\nequipped with a disc embedded with abrasive materials used for cutting\nmaterials. b.    \nThe term band saw shall mean a\nmachine equipped with an endless steel band having a continuous series of\nnotches or teeth, running over wheels or pulleys, and used for sawing materials. c.    \nThe term chain saw shall mean a\nmachine that has teeth linked together to form an endless chain used for\ncutting materials d.    \nThe term circular saw shall mean a\nmachine equipped with a thin steel disc having a continuous series of notches\nor teeth on the periphery, mounted on shafting, and used for sawing materials. e.    \nThe term guillotine shear shall\nmean a machine equipped with a movable blade operated vertically and used to\nshear materials.  The term shall not include other types of shearing machines,\nusing a different form of shearing action, such as alligator shears or circular\nshears. f.     \nThe term reciprocating saw shall\nmean a machine equipped with a moving blade that alternately changes direction\non a linear cutting axis used for sawing materials.  Jig saws are reciprocating\nsaws. g.    \nThe term wood chipper shall mean a\nmachine equipped with a feed mechanism, knives mounted on a rotating chipper\ndisc or drum, and a power plant used to reduce to chips or shred such materials\nas tree branches, trunk segments, landscape waste, and other materials. h.    \nThe term operator shall mean a\nperson who operates a machine covered by this section by performing such\nfunctions as starting or stopping the machine, placing materials into or\nremoving them from the machine, or any other functions directly involved in\noperation of the machine. i.     \nThe term helper shall mean a\nperson who assists in the operation of a machine covered by this section by\nhelping place materials into or remove them from the machine. j.     \nThe term machine equipped with\nfull automatic feed and ejection shall mean machines covered by this HO which\nare equipped with devices for full automatic feeding and ejection and with a\nfixed barrier guard to prevent completely the operator or helper from placing\nany part of his or her body in the point-of-operation area. (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED (1)  HO 14 prohibits minors from performing the occupations\nof operator of, or helper on, power-driven circular saws, band saws and\nguillotine shears which are not equipped with full automatic feed and ejection. (2)  HO 14 prohibits minors from performing the occupations\nof operator or helper on power-driven chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood\nchippers, and abrasive cutting discs; it does not matter if the machines are\nfixed or portable. (3)  HO 14 prohibits minors from performing the occupations\nof setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning power-driven circular\nsaws, band saws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood\nchippers, or abrasive cutting discs regardless of the manner items are fed into\nor ejected from the machines. (c)  \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED Minors may operate or help in the operation of circular saws, band saws\nand guillotine shears when the equipment is fitted with devices for full\nautomatic feeding and ejection and with a fixed guard which prevents operators\nor helpers from placing any part of their bodies in the point-of-operation\narea.  There is no such provision for operating or assisting in the operation\nof chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, or abrasive cutting discs. (d)  \nExemptions HO 14 does provide an exemption for student-learners and apprentices. \nNo other exemptions apply. (e)  \nEnforcement positions (1)  HO 14 does not apply to the following machines as they\nfail to meet the specific definitions of circular saws, band saws or guillotine\nshears: \n\n\n \n  \n  Alligator Shears\n  \n  \n  Friction Saws\n  \n \n \n  \n  Circular Knives\n  \n  \n  Paper Shredders\n  \n \n \n  \n  Circular Shears\n  \n  \n  Wire Saws\n  \n \n\n\n (2)  Bagel slicers – WH will not charge a violation of HO\n14 when 16- or 17-year-old employees operate or clean certain types of bagel\nslicers that meet the HO’s definition of a circular saw (see\nFOH 33h11(e)(1)b3).",
