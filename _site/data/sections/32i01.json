  "text": "(a)  \nReg 548 provides for the exclusion\nof certain “additional” payments in cash or in kind which would have a trivial\neffect on OT compensation and which would otherwise require prorating over a\nretroactive period to compute the OT due. Exclusions are limited to\n“additional” or “incidental” payments; payments which are an “integral part” of\nthe employee’s regular wages may not be excluded. (b)  \nAs a general rule, payments which\nare regularly paid on every payday are not excludable as they are not\n“additional”, but an integral part of the employee’s regular wages.\nFurthermore, the mere fact that payments are deferred to a future time will not\nmake them excludable as additional payments if they amount to nothing more than\nan increase in the rate per hour or per piece. An exception is made for\npayments in kind and certain cash payments, such as Social Security taxes which\nare excludable even if paid every payday. (c)  \nAn “additional” payment within the\nmeaning of the Reg generally is one which is made on a different basis from\nthat which determines the wages to which the employee is regularly entitled and\nis not regularly made every payday. (d)  \nThe following types of payment may\nbe excluded if the 50 cents condition and the requirements of 548.2 are met: (1)  Prizes. (2)  Merchandise awards. (3)  Housing of nominal value. (4)  Lunches. (5)  Social Security taxes. (6)  Flat sum payments or retroactive rate increase made as\nthe result of an increase in the cost of living. (7)  Retroactive wage increases. (8)  Payments made as a reward for attendance paid\nperiodically. (9)  Individual or group production bonuses which are not\nearned every payday and are paid on a basis other than the employee’s regular\nwages (e)  \nThe following types of payment are\nnot excludable even if the other conditions are met: (1)  Night shift differentials.  (2)  Higher rates paid as premium pay for non-OT hours. (3)  Rate increases which become effective after a rise in\nthe cost of living. (4)  Commissions and incentive or production bonuses earned\nregularly every payday which are an integral part of the employee’s wage\nstructure.",
