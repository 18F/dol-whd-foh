  "text": "(a)   This Act contains weekly (after 40 hours) OT pay\nrequirements and applies to most Federal contracts which may require or involve\nthe employment of laborers or mechanics, including watchmen and guards, and to\nwhich any agency or instrumentality of the United States or the District of\nColumbia or a Territory is a party. (See FOH 15g.) CWHSSA was amended by Public\nLaw 99-145 (effective January 1, 1986) to eliminate the daily OT provisions\n(AAM # 143, Dec 23, 1985). (b)  Contracts for construction or services in excess of\n$100,000 are covered by CWHSSA. This Act also extends to Federally-assisted\ncontracts subject to DBRA wage standards to which the Federal government is not\na direct party, except where the Federal assistance is only in the nature of a\nloan guarantee or insurance. (c)   Contracts exempt from this Act are discussed in FOH\n15i00. (d)  Sec. 102 of CWHSSA requires that laborers and\nmechanics employed on covered contracts be paid not less than one and one-half\ntimes their basic rate of pay for hours worked in excess of forty in a w/w. It\nalso provides for liquidated damages in the sum of $10 for each calendar day\n(with respect to each employee employed in violation) on which an employee was\nrequired or permitted to work overtime hours without the payment of OT wages\nrequired by CWHSSA. (e)   Section 107 of the Act provides health and safety\nstandards on covered construction work which are administered by OSHA.",
