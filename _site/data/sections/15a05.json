  "title": "15a05 - The Miller Act (40 U.S.C. §§ 3131-3133).",
  "text": "(a)   This Act provides, in general, that Federal contracts\nin excess of $100,000 for construction, alteration, or repair of any public\nbuilding or public work of the United States, may not be awarded to any person,\nuntil such person furnishes to the United States a bond with a surety\nsatisfactory to the contracting officer for the protection of all persons\nsupplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in the\ncontract. (b)  The Department of Labor exercises no functions under\nthe Miller Act, but the information in this section is pertinent since the Act\nprovides protection to laborers and mechanics, and its application is\ncoextensive with the D-B Act, except for the $100,000 threshold. In order to\nprotect their rights under this Act, employees of prime contractors or first-tier\nsubcontractors must give written notice by registered mail to the prime\ncontractor of failure to receive proper wages within 90 days of the date of\nperformance of the last labor by the underpaid worker. Employees of lower tier\nsub-subcontractors are not protected by the Act. (c)   Suits to recover wages under the Miller Act must be\ncommenced within one year after the date on which the last of the labor was\nperformed and must be brought in the name of the United States, for the use of\nthe person suing, in the United States District Court for any district in which\nthe contract was to be performed and executed. Suit is brought and prosecuted\nby the worker’s own attorney. Although the Miller Act does not apply to\nFederally-assisted projects (i.e., the Related Acts), many States and grant\nprograms require surety bonds with substantially similar requirements.",
