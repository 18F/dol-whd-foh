  "text": "(a)   A mobile home qualifies as a “trailer”\nwithin the meaning of Sec 13(b)(10)(B) if it is designed to be a vehicle or\nmoving conveyance. Mobile homes of any type (including “double/triple wides”)\nmay be considered to be trailers if they are designed to be transported from\nplace to place as a trailer, that is, if they have their own wheels and\nsuspension system and can be towed behind a powered vehicle. (b)   WH will consider a mobile home to be a\ntrailer if it is built on a permanent chassis or transportation system which\nincludes a drawbar and coupling mechanism, frame, running gear assembly, and\nlights. (c)   The following definitions apply to the\ncomponents of a trailer chassis: (1) \n“Drawbar and coupling\nmechanism” includes the rigid assembly upon which the coupling mechanism is\nmounted and which connects the manufactured home’s frame to the towing vehicle. (2) \n“Frame” refers to the\nfabricated rigid substructure which provides support to the manufactured home\nstructure both during transport and on-site. It also provides a platform for\nattachment of the rest of the transportation system. (3) \n“Running gear\nassembly” includes suspension springs, axles, bearings, wheels, hubs, tires,\nand brakes. (4) \n“Lights” means safety\nlights and associated wiring. (d)    (1) \nIn 1976, the U.S.\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development established safety standards (known\nas the HUD Code) for manufactured housing intended for sale as trailers or\nmobile homes.
