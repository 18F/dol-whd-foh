  "text": "The same type of problem as\ndiscussed in FOH 15f08 may be encountered with regard to hourly paid employees\nworking on DBRA covered work and noncovered work in the same w/w. The\ncontractor may not arbitrarily change the employee’s hourly wages to meet its\nDBRA obligations. For example, assume an employee’s regular rate of pay is\n$15.00 per hour and the prevailing wage under DBRA is $19.50 per hour. In a\nweek in which both DBRA and noncovered work are performed, the employer cannot\nreduce the employee’s regular rate of pay of $15.00 per hour on nongovemment\nwork to offset the higher rate required under DBRA This same principle applies\nwhere an employee performs work in more than one DBRA classification; an\nemployee may be paid not less than the specified WD rate for each of the actual\nhours worked in each classification (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(i)).",
