  "text": "(a)   These special\ncalculation of leave provisions apply to airline flight crew employees only.  For\nemployees other than airline flight crew employees, see FOH 39e. The rules governing\ncalculation of intermittent or reduced schedule FMLA leave set forth in 29 CFR\n825.205 do not apply to airline flight crew employees except that such employees\nare subject to the physical impossibility rule.  See FOH 39e01(d). (b)   Airline\nflight crew employees are entitled to a fixed a number of days for taking leave\nfor FMLA-qualifying reasons. (1)  Leave for any\nFMLA-qualifying reason other than military caregiver leave An FMLA-eligible airline flight crew employee\nis entitled to 72 days of FMLA leave during any 12-month period for one or more\nof the FMLA-qualifying reasons other than military caregiver leave (i.e., leave\nfor the birth of a child and to care for the newborn child; placement with the\nemployee of a child for adoption or foster care and to care for the\nnewly-placed child; to care for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent with a\nserious health condition; because of the employee’s own serious health\ncondition; or because of a qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the\nemployee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a military member on covered\nactive duty).  See 29 CFR 825.112(a)(1)-(5). The 72-day entitlement is based on a uniform\n6-day workweek for all airline flight crew employees, regardless of time\nactually worked or paid, multiplied by the statutory 12-workweek entitlement\nfor FMLA leave.  This number corresponds to the maximum 6-day workweek an\nairline flight crew employee can work under FAA regulations. (6-day workweek x\n12 workweeks of FMLA leave = 72 days of FMLA leave entitlements.)  For example,\nif an employee took 3 weeks of FMLA leave for an FMLA-qualifying reason other\nthan military caregiver leave, the employee would use 18 days (6 days x 3\nweeks) of FMLA entitlement. (2)  Military\ncaregiver leave An FMLA-eligible airline flight crew employee\nis entitled to 156 days of military caregiver leave during a single 12-month\nperiod to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness.\n(6-day workweek x 26 workweek entitlement for military caregiver leave = 156\ndays.) (3)  Intermittent or\nreduced schedule leave. When an airline flight crew employee takes\nintermittent or reduced schedule FMLA-leave, the employer must account for the\nleave using an increment no greater than one calendar day.  For example, if an\nairline flight crew employee needs to take FMLA leave for a two-hour physical\ntherapy appointment, the employer may require the employee to use a full day of\nFMLA leave. 29 CFR 825.802",
