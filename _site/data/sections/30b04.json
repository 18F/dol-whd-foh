However, when it is not possible, prior to\npreparing the payroll, to ascertain the number of OT hours worked by an\nemployee in the last w/w of the pay period, the requirements of\nFLSA/PCA/SCA/CWHSSA will be satisfied if the employer pays the OT compensation\nas soon after the regular payday as is practicable. Such a payment should not\nbe delayed for a period longer than is reasonably necessary for the employer to\ncompute and arrange for the payment of the amounts due, but, in any event, not\nlater than the next payday after such computation can be made.",
