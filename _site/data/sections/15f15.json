  "text": "(a)   It has been found that many vacation and sick leave\nplans in the construction industry are generally unfunded plans within the\nmeaning of 29 CFR § 5.28. 29 CFR § 5.28 provides that an unfunded fringe\nbenefit plan will be considered to be a bona fide plan for Davis-Bacon purposes\nif the plan 1) reasonably can be anticipated to provide benefits described in\nthe D-B Act; 2) represents a commitment that can be legally enforced, 3) is\ncarried out under a financially responsible plan or program; and 4) has been communicated\nin writing to the affected employees. To insure that such plans are not used to\navoid compliance with the Act, the S/L directs the contractor to set aside, in\nan account, sufficient assets to meet the future obligation of the plan. At the\ntime the employee takes vacation or sick leave the monies in such an account\ncould be distributed and used as an offset against the vacation and sick leave\nplan obligation of the contractor. However, if a contractor has paid vacation\nor sick leave “out of pocket” under an unfunded plan, credit must be given for\nsuch payments (see (d) below). (b)  If an employee should terminate prior to becoming\neligible under a vacation or sick leave plan, and amounts have been paid into\nan account on such employee’s behalf for which the contractor has taken credit\ntowards meeting its prevailing wage obligations, then the employee must be paid\nthose amounts from the account upon termination. (c)   Situations may be encountered where unused vacation\nand/or sick leave is forfeited upon termination of employment. In such cases,\nthe per hour cost of the vacation and/or sick leave credit must be computed on\nthe basis of the total cost of the vacation and/or sick leave actually used by\neach employee (i.e., forfeited contributions for which the contractor has\nclaimed credit under DBRA may not revert to the contractor). Of course, if the\nemployer pays these accumulated benefits in cash upon termination by an\nemployee, there will be no problem in determining the cash equivalent. (d)  In order to determine the DBRA credit for vacation and\nsick leave, the payments made by the contractor to each employee are divided by\nthe hours worked in the period covered by the payments. Since both sick leave\nand vacation are generally annual type fringe benefits, the total hours worked\nduring the year (government and non-government) should be used as the divisor.\nFor example, let us assume an employee was paid $1500.00 for vacation benefits\nand worked a total of 1500 hours for the employer during the year. The employer\nwould be entitled to a credit of $1.00 per hour against the DBRA prevailing\nwage ($1500 /1500 hours).",
