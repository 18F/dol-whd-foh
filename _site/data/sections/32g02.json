  "text": "(a)  \nContracts under FLSA Sec 7(f) may\nbe made only with, or by their representatives on behalf of, employees whose\nduties necessitate irregular hours of work. In this connection, there is\nnothing in the FLSA which makes the Sec 7(f) exemption inapplicable to any\nclass of employees. Whether or not the duties of employees necessitate\nirregular hours of work must be decided on the facts of employment as to such\nemployees. (b)  \nThe following situations do not\npermit a finding that the employee’s hours are in fact irregular: (1)  The fluctuation results entirely from absences of the\nemployee for reasons other than the nature of his duties, such as absences due\nto illness, vacation, holidays, and the like. (2)  The fluctuation results because the employee works\nfixed workweeks of different lengths. This would include situations where the\nfixed workweeks of longer length occur during seasonal peaks. (3)  The only fluctuation is minor or insignificant. The\nterms minor and insignificant shall be understood to mean fluctuations of 4 or\nless hours between the lowest number of hours worked and the highest number of\nhours worked in any year or where the fluctuations, even though beyond this\nrange are only occasional. (4)  The fluctuation, (even though more than occasional,\nminor or insignificant) occurs exclusively or nearly so in the hours above the\napplicable statutory OT standard. (c)  \nWhere irregular hours are worked\nduring most of the contract period, the irregular hours of work criterion will\nbe met even though there are periods in which regular hours are worked.\nLikewise, where irregular hours are worked during the entire period, a single\nSec 7(f) contract or agreement covering the entire period may be proper even\nthough hours fluctuated at a low level during the slack season and at a high\nlevel during the busy season. In the latter case, it is possible also to have\ntwo Sec 7(f) contracts, one for the busy season and one for the slack season. A\nfurther discussion with reference to irregular hours is contained in IB\n778.405.",
