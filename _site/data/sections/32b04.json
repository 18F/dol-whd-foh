  "text": "(a)  \nIf an employee is given a\nstipulated salary with the understanding that it constitutes straight time pay\nfor all hours he works, and if his hours of work fluctuate from week to week,\nhis regular rate of pay ordinarily will vary from week to week in accordance\nwith the number of hours worked each week. The regular rate, of course, cannot\nbe less than the applicable MW. Since straight time compensation has already\nbeen paid, such an employee must receive additional OT compensation for each OT\nhour in a particular w/w computed at not less than one-half the regular rate\nobtained by dividing the weekly salary by the number of hours worked in that\nw/w. If the employer to avoid weekly computations chooses to pay extra\nhalf-time based on the salary divided by 40 hours, such a method is permissible. (b)  \nThe above rule will apply where an\nemployee works a varying number of hours, and normally receives his full salary\nregardless of how few the scheduled hours may be in a particular week, even\nthough occasional disciplinary deductions for willful absence or tardiness are\nmade. Disciplinary deductions of course, may not cut into the MW or OT pay\nrequired by the Act. (c)  \nSimilarly, an employee employed on\na fixed salary basis for irregular hours of work may be paid a pro rata share\nof his salary in the initial or terminal week of his employment, when he is not\nin payroll status for the entire week.",
