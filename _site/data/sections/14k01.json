The terms “laborers” and “mechanics”\ninclude at least those employees whose duties are manual or physical in nature\nas distinguished from mental or managerial. Generally, employees whose duties\nare supervisory, professional, and clerical are not “laborers” or “mechanics”\nfor purposes of CWHSSA. Determinations as to whether individual employees are\n“laborers” or “mechanics” are based on the duties actually performed under the\ncontract rather than occupational titles or job descriptions. A job that\nrequires manual and mechanical dexterity and is primarily reliant on the use of\nhands would be typical of mechanical or manual occupations that would fall with\nthe scope of a “laborer” or “mechanic” under CWHSSA. The CWHSSA also applies to\nguards and “watchmen” employed on Government contracts in excess of $100,000.\n(See SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.181(b); CWHSSA 29 C.F.R. 5.5(b); FOH 15j.)",
