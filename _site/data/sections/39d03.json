  "text": "(a)   An\neligible employee is entitled to take up to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave in a\n12-month period to care for a covered family member with a serious health\ncondition.  The employee must provide notice to the employer of the need for\nleave and provide requested certifications pursuant to 29 CFR 825.305. (b)   An\nemployee is entitled to take intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule to\ncare for a family member only when medically necessary.  This may include not\nonly a situation where the condition of the family member is intermittent but\nalso where the employee is only needed intermittently—such as where other care\nis normally provided by others. 29 CFR 825.202(b) (c)   The concept\nof “needed to care for” a family member encompasses both physical or\npsychological care, and may include one or more of the following: (1)  Providing\npsychological comfort and reassurance to a child, parent, or spouse receiving\ninpatient or home care, (2)  Providing basic\nnutritional, medical, hygienic care of the family member who is unable to care\nfor these needs him or herself, (3)  Providing\nsafety for the family member with a serious health condition who cannot safely\nbe left alone, (4)  Providing\ntransportation to doctor appointments, therapy, or other treatments, and (5)  Attending care\nconferences during which the family member’s health care provider discusses the\nfamily member’s condition, immediate needs, incidents, and general well being. 29 CFR 825.124WHD Non-Administrator Letter FMLA-94 February\n27, 1998 (d)   Definitions (1)  Spouse a.     Spouse\nmeans a husband or wife as defined or recognized under state law for purposes\nof marriage in the State where the employee resides, including common law\nmarriage and same sex marriage. 29 USC 2611(13)29 CFR 825.122(b) b.     WHD\nNon-Administrator Letter FMLA-98 (Nov. 18, 1998) states, in part, that the FMLA\ndefinition of spouse is limited by the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). On June\n26, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court held in United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct.\n2675 (2013), that the referenced provision of DOMA was unconstitutional;\ntherefore, the above definition of spouse took effect. (2)  Son or daughter a.     The\nFMLA defines a son or daughter as a biological, adopted, or foster child, a\nstepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis who\nis under age 18; or 18 or older and incapable of self-care because of a\nphysical or mental disability at the time that FMLA leave is to commence.  It\ndoes not matter if the onset of the disability occurs before or after the son\nor daughter turns 18 for purposes of FMLA leave, provided that the disability\nexists and renders the adult child incapable of self-care at the time the\nemployee’s leave is to commence. 29 USC 2611(12)29 CFR 825.122(d)WHD Administrator’s\nInterpretation No. 2013-1 b.     Physical\nor mental disability Physical or mental\ndisability means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one\nor more of the major life activities of an individual. Regulations at 29 CFR\n1630.2 (h), (i) and (j), issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\nunder the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq., define\nthese terms. The Americans with\nDisabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) significantly broadened the\nscope of the ADA’s definition of disability.  Because the FMLA’s definition of\nan adult son or daughter relies on the ADA’s definition of disability, the\nchanges to the definition of disability set forth in the ADAAA and its\nimplementing regulations apply to the definition of a son or daughter 18 years\nof age or older under the FMLA.  See WHD Administrator’s Interpretation No. 2013-1. 1.     “Substantially\nlimits” does not require that the impairment prevents, or severely or\nsignificantly restricts, the individual in performing a major life activity. 2.     Major\nlife activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing\nmanual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting,\nbending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking,\ncommunicating, interacting with others, and working.  Major life activities\nalso include the operation of major bodily functions, such as functions of the\nimmune system, normal cell growth, and digestive, brain, respiratory,\nneurological and reproductive functions. 3.     The\nuse of mitigating measures to ameliorate the effects of an impairment may not\nbe considered when determining the limitations on a major life activity, except\nfor the use of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses. 4.     An\nimpairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if the impairment\nwould substantially limit a major life activity when active.  Examples include,\nbut are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, asthma, epilepsy, diabetes, lupus,\npost traumatic stress disorder and cancer in remission. 5.     There\nis no minimum duration of time required for an impairment to be considered a\ndisability. 6.     The\nterm disability is to be construed in favor of broad coverage when determining\nif an individual has a disability. 7.     The\nEEOC’s regulations provide that some impairments will virtually always qualify\nas disabilities because, by their very nature, they substantially limit at\nleast one major life activity.  Impairments that should easily be concluded to\nbe substantially limiting include deafness, blindness, intellectual disability,\nmissing limbs or mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair,\nautism, cancer, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”) infection, muscular dystrophy, major depressive\ndisorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive\ncompulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. c.     Incapable\nof self-care Incapable of\nself-care means that the individual requires active assistance or supervision\nto provide daily self-care in three or more “activities of daily living” (ADLs)\nor “instrumental activities of daily living” (IADLs) due to a disability. 1.     Activities\nof daily living include adaptive activities such as caring appropriately for\none’s grooming and hygiene, bathing, dressing and eating. 2.     Instrumental\nactivities of daily living include cooking, cleaning, shopping, taking public\ntransportation, paying bills, maintaining a residence, using telephones and\ndirectories, using a post office, etc. 3.     These\nlists of ADLs and IADLs are not exhaustive and additional activities should\nalso be considered in determining whether an adult son or daughter is incapable\nof self-care due to a disability. 4.     The\ndetermination of whether an adult son or daughter is incapable of self-care is\nmade based on the individual’s condition at the time the employee requests\nleave.  The determination should include, for example, the current effects of\nany episodic impairment. d.     There\nare special definitions of son and daughter applicable to military family leave\nthat are not limited by age.  See 29 CFR 825.122(h) and (i). (3)  Parent Parent means a biological, adoptive, step or\nfoster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco parentis to\nthe employee when the employee was a son or daughter (as defined by the FMLA). \nThis term does not include parents-in-law. 29 USC 2611(7)29 CFR 825.122(c) There is a special definition of parent\napplicable to military caregiver leave.  29 CFR 825.122(j). (4)  In Loco\nParentis In loco parentis means in the place of a\nparent.  An employee who stands in loco parentis to a child is entitled to\nleave for bonding purposes or if leave is needed to care for the child with a\nserious health condition.  An eligible employee is also entitled to FMLA leave\nto care for someone who stood in loco parentis to the employee when he or she was\na child.  Whether an in loco parentis relationship exists is dependent upon the\nspecific facts of the case.  Factors to be looked at in determining whether an in\nloco parentis relationship exists include: a.     The\nage of the child, b.     The\ndegree to which the child is dependent on the person claiming in loco parentis\nstatus, c.     The\namount of support, if any, provided, and d.     The\nextent to which duties commonly associated with parenthood are exercised. A blood or legal relationship is irrelevant to\ndetermining in loco parentis status.  For example, an employee who will share\nequally in the raising of an adopted child with a same-sex partner, but who\ndoes not have a legal relationship with the child, stands in loco parentis to\nthe child.  In addition, the fact that a child has a biological mother and\nfather does not prevent a finding that another individual stands in loco\nparentis to the child. WHD Administrator’s Interpretation No. 2010-3 (e)   Leave for\nother family members (1)  Generally, an\nemployee is not entitled to FMLA leave to care for other family members with\nserious health conditions, such as siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, or\nparents-in-law. (2)  Exceptions may\narise where the employee can document the existence of an in loco parentis\nrelationship.  For example, an employee may take FMLA leave to care for an aunt\nor uncle with a serious health condition if the aunt or uncle stood in loco\nparentis to the employee when the employee was a child.  See FOH 39d09(b)(4)\nfor military caregiver “next of kin” definition. WHD
