  "text": "WHD\nhas found Certified Occupational Therapist Assistants (COTAs) employed by a\nschool district to be nonexempt as learned professionals.   The\nprimary duty of a COTA is assisting occupational therapists in providing\ntherapeutic educational programs for students.  According to the school\ndistrict’s COTA job description, the only educational requirement is that which\nis sufficient to obtain certification by the state Board of Occupational\nTherapy Examiners.  One of the prerequisites for certification by the state is\nthe completion of “at least 60 academic semester credits or the equivalent from\nan accredited institution of higher education.”  The\nprimary duty test under the learned professional exemption requires that: (a)  \nThe employee must perform work requiring advanced knowledge,\n(b)  \nThe advanced knowledge must be in a field of science or\nlearning, and (c)  \nThe advanced knowledge must be customarily acquired by a\nprolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.   COTAs\ndid not meet the primary duty test. The COTAs’ primary duty does not require\n“knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily\nacquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.” \nOccupations that “require only a four-year degree in any field or a two-year\ndegree as a standard prerequisite for entrance into the field . . . do not\nqualify for the learned professional exemption.”  69 FR 22121, 22150 (Apr. 23,\n2004). Completion of 60 semester hours does not qualify as a “prolonged course\nof specialized intellectual instruction. COTAs also did not meet the definition\nof a registered or certified medical technologist.  The regulations contain\nspecific academic requirements for exemption: Registered\nor certified medical technologists who have successfully completed three\nacademic years of pre-professional study in an accredited college or university\nplus a fourth year of professional course work in a school of medical\ntechnology approved by the Council of Medical Education of the American Medical\nAssociation generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional\nexemption.   29\nCFR § 541.301(e)(1).  Becoming a COTA only requires 60 semester hours of study,\nrather than the more rigorous course of study required for registered or\ncertified medical technologists.     The\nexistence of a mandatory, accredited certification program for COTAs, standing\nalone, does not satisfy the regulatory requirement for a prolonged course of\nspecialized intellectual instruction for entry into the field.   Accredited curriculums and certification programs are\nrelevant to determining exempt learned professional status to the extent they\nprovide evidence that a prolonged course of specialized intellectual\ninstruction has become a standard prerequisite for entrance into the occupation\nas required under section 541.301.  Neither the identity of the certifying\norganization nor the mere fact that certification is required is determinative,\nif certification does not involve a prolonged course of specialized intellectual\ninstruction. 69\nFR at 22157 Consequently,\nbecause the occupational therapist assistant occupation does not require\n“knowledge of an advanced type . . . customarily acquired by a prolonged course\nof specialized intellectual instruction,” these employees do not qualify for\nthe “learned professional” exemption.   Additionally,\nthe COTAs do not qualify for the exemption for administrative employees in\neducational establishments.  See 29 CFR § 541.204.  Section 541.204 provides an\nexemption for employees “whose primary duty is performing administrative\nfunctions directly related to academic instruction or training in an\neducational establishment or department or subdivision thereof.”  29 CFR §\n541.204(a)(2).  Section 541.204(c)(2), however, states that “jobs relating to\nthe health of the students . . . do not perform academic administrative\nfunctions” and do not fulfill the requirements for the educational\nestablishments exemption.
