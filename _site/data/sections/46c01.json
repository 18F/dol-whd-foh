  "text": "(a)   “Deduction”\nmeans any amount by which the H-2B worker’s cash wages are decreased. A\ndeduction may be shown on the payroll records, marked as a deduction or a wage\ncredit (e.g., FICA, housing). However, a deduction will also be considered to\nexist where the H-2B worker’s cash wages have been decreased through\nout-of-pocket expenditures made by the H-2B worker for business expenses of the\nH-2B employer incurred in obtaining the worker's H-2B status. Such expenses\ninclude: (1)  Attorney's or agent's\nfees incurred for any activity related to the Application for Temporary\nEmployment Certification or petition filing. (2)  Recruitment costs,\nincluding the cost of advertising or payment to a foreign or domestic\nrecruitment service. (3)  A discussion of the\nFLSA’s impact on visa fees and inbound and outbound transportation for H-2B\nworkers is set forth in FOH 46c01(f) and 46c02. (b)   A wage\nviolation will exist where a deduction causes the cash wage to fall below the\nrequired wage, unless the deduction is made in accordance with the H-2B\nregulations. If the H-2B worker receives the required wage despite the\ndeduction, there is no violation. (c)   The employer\nmust make all deductions from the worker's wages that are required by law (e.g.,\nincome tax and FICA). (d)   The H-2B\nemployer may make deductions not required by law if such deductions: (1)  Are specified in the\njob offer, (2)  Are reasonable (the\nemployer may not profit from the deduction), and (3)  Do not violate federal,\nstate, or local law. (e)   Fees paid to\nUSCIS when filing a Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (Form I-129) may not be\ndeducted to the extent they reduce the worker's wages to below the required\nwage. Such fees include: (1)  A basic filing fee of\n$320.00, (2)  An additional premium\nprocessing fee of $1,000.00 if expedited processing is requested, and (3)  A “fraud prevention\nand detection fee” of $150.00 mandated by the Save Our Small and Seasonal\nBusiness Act of 2005 (SOBA) to be paid by all H-2B petitioning employers. (f)   The statute\nrequires that the employer pay the reasonable cost of the H-2B's return\ntransportation to his/her last place of residence abroad if the employer\nterminates the worker prior to the end of the approved status. See 8 USC\n1184(c)(5).",
