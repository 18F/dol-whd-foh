However, this rule applies to sleeping berth time of truck\ndrivers or helpers only when they are on continuous tours of duty during trips\naway from home for a period of 24 hours or more. If the trip begins and ends at\nthe home station and is performed within one working day (less than 24 hours),\nall time on duty on the truck is time worked (except, of course, for bona fide\nmeal periods) even though some of that time is spent in the sleeping berth.\n(FOH 31b00.) (b)  \nTours of duty of 24 hours or more\nbut less than 48 hours. FOH\n31b12 and IB 785.22 describe excludable sleep time for hours of duty of 24\nhours or more. On continuous tours of duty of more than 24 hours but less than\n48 hours, one extra hour of sleep time in excess of the maximum 8 hours may be\nclaimed for each hour beyond 40 that a continuous tour of duty extends,\nprovided that the employee has actually slept such number of hours. For\nexample, in a 42-hour continuous tour of duty, no more than 10 hours could be\ndeducted for sleep time. Similarly, in a 45-hour continuous tour, a maximum of\n13 hours could be deducted. However, in the absence of an express or implied\nagreement concerning the exclusion of sleep time, the time spent sleeping\nconstitutes hours worked even though the tour of duty exceeds 24 hours. See\nalso 31b12. (c)  \nContinuous tours of duty. (1)  As indicated in IB 785.12 through 785.16, waiting or\nlayover time will be considered off-duty time and not part of the employee’s\nhours of work if the employee is completely relieved of all duties and\nresponsibilities, is permitted to leave the truck or temporary station to go\nanywhere, knows in advance that work will not resume until a specified time,\nand the period of layover is of sufficient length to be used effectively for\nthe employee’s own purposes. Thus, no standard rule of thumb, such as “2-hour\nlayover time” or “4-hour layover time” can be used to unequivocally state that\na layover period of such length has automatically broken a continuous tour of\nduty. Whether or not a continuous tour of duty greater than 24 hours is\ninterrupted by a waiting or layover time is a question of fact. For example, if\na truck driver stops for a layover of 2 hours, but the stopping point happens\nto be in a remote location which has no available facilities (restaurants,\netc.), the tour of duty has not been interrupted and the “off-duty” time is\ncompensable hours worked. (2)  With regard to team truck drivers, because of the\nspecial circumstances under which they work, we would not regard a bona fide\nlayover period as breaking a continuous tour of duty if the employer paid wages\nfor that period. (3)  Time spent in noncompensable bona fide meal periods\nand bona fide regularly scheduled sleeping periods would not break a continuous\ntour of duty provided that such periods do not exceed the maximum limitations\nin 785.22 and the “40-hour rule” set forth in (b) above.
