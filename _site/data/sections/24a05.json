  "text": "(a)   Sec 203(a)(17) of the Motor Carrier Act\ndefines the term “private carrier of property by motor vehicle” to mean “any\nperson not included in the terms ‘common carrier by motor vehicle’ or ‘contract\ncarrier by motor vehicle’ , who or which transports in interstate or foreign\ncommerce by motor vehicle property of which such person is the owner, lessee,\nor bailee, when such transportation is for the purpose of sale, lease, rent, or\nbailment, or in furtherance of any commercial enterprise”. (b)   It should be noted that the DOT\njurisdiction over private carriers is limited to private carriers of\n“property”. If the transportation of persons is the primary purpose of a trip\nin interstate commerce by a private carrier and any incidental transportation\nof property is not significant as a reason for the trip, the transportation\ninvolved would not be within the jurisdiction of the DOT. An employee would not\nbe considered as engaged in transporting property for purposes of the Motor\nCarrier Act because of an arrangement to drive by the post office on his way to\nor from work to pick up or deliver his employer’s interstate mail or packages,\nwhether bulky or not. (c)   If the transportation of property,\nregardless of its bulk or weight, is the primary purpose of an interstate trip\nby a private carrier, or if the transportation of such property is a distinct\nand definite reason for the trip along with the transportation of persons, the\ntransportation is within the jurisdiction of the DOT. This principle would\napply, for example, where property such as an automobile or a truck is driven to\nanother State not simply as a means of transportation for the driver or\npassengers but because the movement of the vehicle itself is a distinct purpose\nof the trip. Likewise, this principle applies where self-propelled machines\nsuch as bulldozers and cranes are driven over the public highways as part of a\njourney in which such vehicles are moved from one State to another. (d)   The fact that an employee of a private\ncarrier may use his own vehicle in transporting property in interstate commerce\ndoes not deny an otherwise applicable exemption.",
