  "text": "(a)   As set forth in AAM No. 188, a single “prevailing”\nnationwide H&W rate method has been established for determining FB\nrequirements to be incorporated in most SCA WDs. The single rate is generally\nupdated once a year based upon data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)\nEmployment Cost Index (ECI) summary of Employer Cost for Employee Compensation.\n(See 29 C.F.R. 4.52(a), 4.175.) (b)  “Fixed cost” per employee H&W FBs (29 C.F.R.\n4.175(a)).             (1) \nMost prevailing WDs containing\nH&W and/or pension requirements specify a fixed payment per hour on behalf\nof each service employee. This FB is due each service employee on the basis of\n“all hours paid for,” including paid vacations, holidays, and sick leave, up to\na maximum of 40 hours per week and 2,080 hours per year. Payments are specified\non the WD in hourly, weekly, and monthly amounts. (2) \nIf a WD specifies a FB that can be\nobtained for less than the amount of contribution required on the WD, the\nemployer must make up the difference in cash to the employee, or furnish\nequivalent benefits, or a combination thereof. The FBs and cash equivalent\npayments under the “fixed cost” per employee benefit requirement may be made in\nvarying amounts to employees, provided the total amount paid by the contractor\nfor FBs and/or cash equivalents to each individual employee is at least the\namount required by the WD. (c)   “Average cost” H&W FBs (29 C.F.R. 4.175(b).) (1) \nSome WDs specifically provide for\nH&W and/or pension benefits in terms of average cost. In such cases, a\ncontractor’s contributions per employee to a “bona fide” plan are permitted to\nvary, depending upon the individual employee’s marital or employment status. It\nis also possible under the “average cost” concept for some employees to not\nreceive any FBs. (2) \nThe contractor’s total contributions\nfor all service employees enrolled in the plan must average at least the WD\nrequirements per hour per service employee. In determining average cost, “all\nhours worked,” including overtime hours, for all service employees that were\nemployed on the contract during the payment period must be counted. The term\n“all hours worked” does not include paid leave hours, such as vacations,\nholidays, or sick leave. It also does not cover any unpaid leave time. (3) \nThe contractor’s total\ncontributions for all service employees enrolled in the FB plan(s) must average\nat least the FB obligation stated in the WD. The types and amounts of benefits\n(if any) provided, and the eligibility requirements for service employees to\nparticipate in a FB plan, are decided by the employer. (4) \nIf the contractor’s contributions\naverage less than the amount required during a payment period, the contractor\nmust make up the deficiency by providing cash equivalent payments or equivalent\nFB payments to all service employees who worked on the contract during the\npayment period. However, cash equivalent payments under the “average cost” FB\nrequirements can only be made in an amount determined to be deficient after\npayments have been made to the FB plans, and then must be made equally to all\nservice employees based upon their hours worked. A contractor cannot make cash\nequivalent payments to some employees and not to others, nor can a contractor\npay different cash amounts to employees under the same contract. A contractor\nmust pay the same amount of cash equivalent payments per hour worked to all\nemployees. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(b).) (d)  Some H&W and pension plans contain eligibility\nexclusions for certain employees. Also, employees receiving benefits through\nparticipation in plans of an employer other than the contractor or by a\nspouse’s employer may be prevented from receiving benefits from the\ncontractor’s plan because of prohibitions against “double coverage.” While such\nexclusions do not invalidate an otherwise bona fide plan, the employees excluded\nfrom participation in the plan must be furnished equivalent bona fide FBs or be\npaid a cash equivalent payment during the period they are not eligible, or\nchoose not to participate in the plan. An employee who desires to opt-out of\nthe contractor’s health plan must demonstrate that his or her other coverage\nspecifically prohibits double coverage in writing. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(c).) (e)   It is not required that all employees participating in\na FB plan be entitled to receive payments from the plan at all times. For\nexample, a contractor may be permitted to claim credit for contributions made\nto FB plans on behalf of participating employees during periods of time when\nthey may not be entitled to receive benefits (e.g., a 30-day “waiting period”\nunder some insurance plans for newly hired employees). If no contributions are\nmade for such employees, then no credit may be taken toward the contractor’s FB\nobligations. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(c)(2).) (f)   Payments to a “bona fide” H&W or pension insurance\nplan or trust program may be made on a periodic basis, but not less often than\nquarterly. If the plan requires that contributions be made on a monthly basis,\nthen to be in compliance the contractor must reconcile the cost incurred by\nsuch contributions against its SCA FB obligations on a monthly (or no less\noften than monthly) basis. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(d)(1).) (g)   Where the WD specifies a fixed contribution on behalf\nof each employee, and a contractor exercises the option to make hourly cash\nequivalent or differential payments, such payments must be made promptly on the\nregular payday for wages. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.165(a)(1), 4.175(d)(1),\n4.177(c)(1).) (h)  The only restriction the SCA places on pension plans,\nincluding 401(k) plans, is that they be “bona fide” FB plans. Such plans are\nconsidered “bona fide” if they meet the requirements of Section 7(e)(4) of the\nFLSA. (See FLSA 29 C.F.R. 778.215; SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.170, 4.171(a).) (1) \nNeither the SCA nor its\nimplementing regulations address vesting requirements with respect to retirement\nplans. However, bona fide plans are required to meet the vesting requirements\npursuant to ERISA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.171(a)(5).) (2) \nPension plans that define a year’s\nservice for vesting purposes in terms of a minimum number of hours worked by a\nparticipant and require certain number of years in service for a participant to\nbecome fully vested would be in compliance with the SCA so long as the plan’s\nvesting provisions meet ERISA’s requirements. (3) \nPension plans often provide that\nforfeitures of employees who do not vest under the plan will be used to reduce\nthe employer’s contribution in the following year. For SCA purposes, an\nemployer may not use forfeitures as a credit towards satisfying the\nrequirements of an applicable WD. To allow an employer to do so would result in\nthe employer’s taking double credit for the same contribution. Forfeitures that\nare allocated to the accounts of remaining eligible participants would,\nhowever, be creditable toward meeting FB obligations under the SCA.",
