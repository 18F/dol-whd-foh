In\ndetermining whether such installation constitutes engagement in “construction\nor reconstruction” for purposes of Sec 3(s)(4), it is necessary to consider the\ngeneral characteristics of the entire transaction. At least in situations where\none or more of the following conditions are present the installation will normally\nbe considered as engagement in construction or reconstruction: (1)  The cost of installation is substantial in relation to\nthe sale of the goods. (2)  The installation involves substantial structural\nchanges, extensive labor, planning, or the use of specialized equipment. (3)  The goods are being installed in conjunction with the\nconstruction, renovation, remodeling, or reconstruction of a home or other\nstructure. (4)  The goods installed are of a specialized type which\nthe general consuming public does not ordinarily have occasion to use. (b)          \nBy way of example of the\nprinciples involved, if the installation requires only minor carpentry,\nplumbing, or electrical work (as may be the case where ordinary plumbing\nfixtures, or household items such as stoves, garbage disposals, attic fans, or\nwindow air conditioners are being installed or replaced), or where only labor\nof the type required for the usual installation of chain link fences around a\nhome or small business establishment is involved, in the absence of any of the\ncriteria listed in (a) above, such installation will not normally be considered\nas “construction or reconstruction”. (c)           \nIn determining the cost of\ninstallation in relation to the sale price of the goods pursuant to subsec\n(a)(1) above and IB 779.321, the difference between the total price paid by the\npurchaser for the installed job and the price charged him for the materials\nused is the cost (to the purchaser) of installation.",
