  "text": "(a)  \nTo qualify for the administrative exemption, an employee’s\nprimary duty must include the exercise of discretion and independent judgment\nwith respect to matters of significance.  The exercise of discretion and\nindependent judgment involves the comparison and the evaluation of possible\ncourses of conduct and acting or making a decision after the various\npossibilities have been considered.  The term must be applied in light of all\nthe facts of the employee’s particular employment situation, and implies that the\nemployee has authority to make an independent choice, free from immediate\ndirection or supervision.  Factors to consider include, but are not limited to\nwhether the employee has authority to formulate, affect, interpret, or\nimplement management policies or operating practices; whether the employee\ncarries out major assignments in conducting the operations of the business;\nwhether the employee performs work that affects business operations to a\nsubstantial degree (even if the work relates to operation of only a particular\nsegment of the business); whether the employee has authority to commit the\nemployer in matters that have significant financial impact; whether the\nemployee has authority to waive or deviate from established policies and\nprocedures without prior approval; whether the employee has authority to\nnegotiate and bind the company on significant matters; whether the employee\nprovides consultation or expert advice to management; whether the employee is\ninvolved in planning long- or short-term business objectives; whether the\nemployee investigates and resolves matters of significance on behalf of\nmanagement; and whether the employee represents the employer in handling\ncomplaints, arbitrating disputes or resolving grievances.  Federal courts\ngenerally find that employees who meet at least two or three of these factors\nare exercising discretion and independent judgment, although a case-by-case\nanalysis is required. 69\nFR 22143 through 2214429\nCFR § 541.202(a), (b), and (c)  (b)  \nThe fact that an employee’s decisions or recommendations\nare on occasion revised or reversed after higher review does not mean that the\nemployee is not exercising discretion and independent judgment.  For example,\nthe credit policies formulated by the credit manager of a large corporation may\nbe subject to review by higher company officials who may approve or disapprove\nthese policies.  A management consultant who has studied the operations of a\nbusiness and proposed changes in organization may have the plan reviewed or\nrevised by superiors before it is submitted to the client.  These factors do\nnot detract from the fact that the work of these employees includes the\nexercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of\nsignificance directly related to management or general business operations.   29\nCFR § 541.202(c)  (c)  \nThe exercise of discretion and independent judgment must be\nmore than the use of skill in applying well-established techniques, procedures\nor specific standards described in manuals or other sources. Exempt employees\nmay use manuals, guidelines or other established procedures if they contain or\nrelate to highly technical, scientific, legal, financial or other similarly\ncomplex matters that can be understood or interpreted only by those with\nadvanced or specialized knowledge or skills.  Employees who simply apply\nwell-established techniques or procedures within closely prescribed limits,\nhowever, are not exempt.  The exercise of discretion and independent judgment\nalso does not include clerical or secretarial work; recording or tabulating\ndata; or performing other mechanical, repetitive, recurrent or routine work. \nAn employee who simply tabulates data is not exempt even if labeled a\n“statistician.”  29\nCFR §§ 541.202(e), 541.704  (d)  \nThe term “matters of significance” refers to the level of\nimportance or consequence of the work performed to the management or general\nbusiness operations of the employer or of the employer’s customers.  An\nemployee does not exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to\nmatters of significance merely because the employer will experience financial\nlosses if the employee fails to perform the job properly.  A messenger, for\nexample, who is entrusted with carrying large sums of money does not exercise\ndiscretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance\neven though serious consequences may result from the employee’s neglect. \nSimilarly, an employee who operates very expensive equipment does not exercise\ndiscretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance\nmerely because improper performance of the employee’s duties may cause serious\nfinancial loss to the employer.   29\nCFR § 541.202(f) 69\nFR 22143WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2006-27",
