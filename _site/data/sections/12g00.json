Sec 3(s)(5) as amended reads as follows: “(5) is engaged in the operation of a hospital, an institution\nprimarily engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, the mentally ill or\ndefective who reside on the premises of such institution, a school for mentally\nor physically handicapped or gifted children, a preschool, elementary or\nsecondary school or an institution of higher education (regardless of whether\nor not such hospital, institution, or school is public or private or operated\nfor profit or not for profit), or” Prior to 7/1/72, employees of preschools were not covered under Sec\n3(s)(5). (c)           \nOn June 24, 1976, the Supreme\nCourt in the case of National League of Cities. et al. v. Usery held that the\nMW and OT provisions of the FLSA do not apply to State and local government\nemployees engaged in activities which are an integral part of traditional\ngovernment services. (See FOH 59d.) The Court expressly found that the\nfollowing activities were among those to which these provisions do not apply:\n“schools, hospitals, fire prevention, police protection, sanitation, public\nhealth, parks and recreation”. Additionally, there are certain activities\nclearly reserved for State and local governments which DOL will regard as no\nlonger subject to MW and OT (e.g., the Courts, Legislatures and other governing\nbodies, tax assessor’s office). The Court’s decision does not discuss\nactivities which might be regarded as “nontraditional” such as State liquor stores,\nand utility and transit services. The majority opinion does state that the MW\nand OT provisions could apply to a State’s operation of a railroad. Questions\nwhich cannot be resolved because of uncertainty as to whether the function is\n“traditional”, should be developed and referred to the RS for an opinion. (d)          \nThe Court’s decision deals only\nwith the MW and OT provisions of the FLSA.
