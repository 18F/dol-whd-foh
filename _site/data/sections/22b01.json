See 29 CFR §\n541.700 and FOH 22a03.  In Marshall v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 621 F.2d\n1246 (3rd Cir. 1980), which involved a three-month strike period, the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that the primary duty requirement\nthen existing in the regulation’s “short test” for high-salaried managerial\nemployees could not be applied on a workweek basis (or over any specific\ntimeframe under the regulatory language).  Based on this ruling, WHD will, on a\nnationwide basis, deem the primary duty test to be satisfied during a strike\nperiod, provided that the otherwise exempt employee who performs nonexempt work\nduring that period (1) satisfied the primary duty test prior to the strike and\n(2) is paid on a salary basis at a rate not less than the required weekly\namount of $455 during the strike. Marshall\nv.
