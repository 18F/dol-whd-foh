Another example is the cutting of a\ntrail, known as a “skid road”, through the woods for the removal of logs\ndragged by a tractor or snaked out by a cable attached to a donkey engine. Such\na road may require minor clearing operations, including the removal of\nunderbrush, stumps, and trees to give the necessary access. (b)  \nExempt road building is that sort\nnormally done by the members of a logging crew. Employees who are employed in\nconstructing major logging roads, and employees building roads normally built\nby persons who specialize in building roads, are not engaged in forestry or\nlogging operations within the meaning of the exemptions.  Major logging roads\nare those from the central collecting points to the mill.",
