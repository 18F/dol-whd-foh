Accordingly, HOs 8, 10, 11 and 12 were revised to\nprohibit minors from setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and cleaning the\nmachines prohibited by those HOs. (b)  \nHO 14 serves as a “catch-all” HO. \nIt prohibits minors from operating circular saws, band saws guillotine shears,\nchain saws, wood chippers, abrasive cutting discs, and reciprocating saws in\nany employment situation where this machinery is not prohibited by any of the\nother HOs.  This is discussed further in the Scope of HO 14 (see\nFOH 33h14(a)).",
