  "text": "(a)   General An eligible employee\nis entitled to up to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave per 12-month period for FMLA-qualifying\nreasons other than military caregiver leave (see FOH 39d09).  Multiple\nserious health conditions or qualifying reasons for leave do not increase the FMLA\nleave entitlement.  However, an employee is entitled to up to 12 workweeks of leave\nfor any one or for multiple qualifying reasons in the same leave year and additional\nleave for the same qualifying reason, including the same serious health condition,\nin subsequent leave years. See FOH 39d09(a)(3)\nfor the single 12-month period applicable to military caregiver leave. (b)   12-month\nFMLA leave year for qualifying leave reasons other than military caregiver\nleave. (1)  The employer\nmay select any one of the following methods for determining the 12-month period\nduring which the 12 workweeks of leave entitlement occur: a.     The\ncalendar year b.     Any\nfixed 12-month leave year, such as a fiscal year. c.     A\n12-month period measured forward from the first date of FMLA leave for the\nemployee.  The next 12-month period would begin the first time FMLA leave is\ntaken after completion of the prior 12-month period. d.     A\nrolling 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses FMLA\nleave.  Under this method, each time an employee takes FMLA leave the remaining\nleave would be the balance of the 12 weeks which has not been used during the\nimmediately preceding 12 months. 1.     Example\n1: Employee A used eight\nweeks of FMLA leave during the past 12 months, employee A has an additional\nfour weeks of FMLA leave available. Example 2: Employee B used four\nweeks of FMLA beginning February 1, 2011, four weeks beginning June 1, 2011,\nand four weeks beginning December 1, 2011.  Employee B may not take any\nadditional leave FMLA leave until February 1, 2012.  Beginning on February 1,\n2012, employee B is entitled to use one additional day of FMLA leave each day\nfor four weeks. Employee B also begins to regain additional days of FMLA leave\nbeginning on June 1, 2012, and additional days beginning on December 1, 2012. (2)  Employers may\nchoose any method as long as it is applied uniformly and consistently to all\nemployees.  An exception to this uniformity applies in the case of a multi-state\nemployer who must comply with a state requirement for determination of the leave\nyear. In this case the employer may comply with the state requirement for\nemployees in that state and uniformly choose another method for all its other\nemployees. (3)  An employer may\nchange to another leave year determination only after providing 60 days notice\nto all employees.  During the 60-day transition, employees retain full benefit\nof their 12 workweeks of leave under whichever method provides the greatest\nbenefit. (4)  If an employer\nfails to select one of these methods for setting the 12-month period, the\nemployer must use the 12-month period calculation method that is most\nbeneficial to the employee. 29 CFR 825.200",
