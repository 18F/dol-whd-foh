  "text": "The FLSA (29 U.S.C. § 201,\net seq.) prescribes standards for the basic minimum wage and overtime pay that\nmay affect SCA-covered contracts. The FLSA interacts with the SCA in three key\nways: (a)   Section 2(b)(1) of the SCA provides that no contractor\nor subcontractor shall pay any employee engaged in performing work on a covered\ncontract less that the minimum wage specified under Section 6(a)(1) of the\nFLSA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.159.)  (b)  Section 8(b) of the SCA defines the term \"service\nemployee\" as any person engaged in the performance of a contract or that\nportion of a contract subject to the SCA except those employees in bona fide\nexecutive, administrative, or professional capacities as those terms are\ndefined in the FLSA regulations found at 29 C.F.R. Part 541. (See 41 U.S.C.\n357(b); 29 C.F.R. 4.113.) (c)   Section 6 of the SCA recognizes that other Federal\nlaws, such as the FLSA, may require overtime compensation to be paid to service\nemployees working on or in connection with contracts subject to the SCA. (See\n41 U.S.C. 355; SCA, 29 C.F.R. 4.180-4.182; FLSA 29 C.F.R. Part 778.)",
