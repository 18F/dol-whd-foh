Such use, however,\ndoes not prohibit utilizing Secs 13(i) or 13(j) for certain other employees\nsimply because Sec 13(h) is used. Thus, for example, if an employer claims Sec\n13(h) for certain employees in the establishment, he or she cannot claim other\nSec 7 or Sec 13 exemptions for them, but can utilize Secs 13(a)(1), 13(i), or\n13(j) for non-Sec 13(h) activities by other employees.  (2) \nThe statutory\nwording \"necessary and incidental\" in Sec 13(h) is not analogous in\nscope to that of \"engaged in\" in Secs 13(i) and 13(j) and shall not\nbe interpreted to have the same meaning and effect. For example, employers\nwhose employees actually perform the operations described in Sec 13(i) or 13(j)\nmay claim the exemption for those so engaged. Employers whose employees are\nengaged in occupations \"necessary and incidental\" to work performed\npursuant to Sec 13(i) or 13(j), who work exclusively in such operations and who\nwork solely in those portions of the premises devoted by their employer to such\noperations, may claim exemption(s) provided by Sec 13(h). (3) \nSec 13(h) is more\nnarrow in its application than the expired Secs 7(c) and 7(d) with respect to\nthe cotton storing and compressing and cottonseed processing industries.\nPursuant to Reg 526.10(b)(8) and 526.11(b)(1), old Secs 7(c) and 7(d) exempted\nentire industries, whereas Secs 13(h)(1)(B) and 13(h)(1)(C) exempt only\nindividual employees. Sec 13(h) requires that              employees be\n\"exclusively\" involved in specified activities (thus permitting no\ntolerances). (c)  \nSec 13(h)\nprovides an exemption for employees performing auxiliary services (services\nthat are \"necessary and incidental\" to the named operations) which\nare not exempt under Secs 13(i) and 13(j). It also replaces Secs 7(c) and/or\n(d) with respect to the operations named in Sec 13(h) which were previously\nexempted under Secs 7(c) and/or 7(d). For example employees not actually engaged\nin ginning cotton (see IB 780.810) or processing sugar beets, sugar beet\nmolasses, or sugar cane into sugar (see IB 780.818) may be eligible for the\nexemption provided by this Sec.",
