  "text": "(a)   Timing of\nnotice When the approximate\ntiming of the need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must provide\nnotice to the employer as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances\nof the particular case.  It generally should be possible and practical within\nthe time prescribed by the employer’s usual and customary notice requirements. 29 CFR 825.303(a) (b)   Content\nof notice An employee must\nprovide sufficient information for an employer to reasonably determine whether\nthe FMLA may apply to the leave request.  Calling in “sick” without providing\nmore information is not considered sufficient notice to trigger an employer’s\nobligations under the FMLA.  The employer is expected to obtain additional\ninformation through informal means. 29 CFR 825.303(b) (c)   Complying\nwith employer policies When the need for\nleave is not foreseeable, the employee must still comply with the employer’s\nusual and customary notice and procedural requirements for taking leave unless\nthere are unusual circumstances.  For example, an employee would not be\nrequired to follow an employer’s procedural requirement to call-in prior to the\nstart of his or her shift if a medical emergency requiring FMLA leave prevented\nthe employee from doing so.  If the employee does not comply with the\nemployer’s usual and customary policies for requesting unforeseeable leave and\nno unusual circumstances exist, FMLA leave may be delayed or denied. 29 CFR 825.302(c)",
