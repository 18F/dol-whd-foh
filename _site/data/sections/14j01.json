  "text": "(a)   To be considered “bona fide” for SCA purposes, a FB\nplan, fund, or program must constitute a legally enforceable obligation which\nmeets certain criteria. The plan, fund, or program must be compliant with the\nEmployment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), laws and regulations\nenforced by the IRS, and State insurance laws, and contributions must be made\nirrevocably to a trustee or third person pursuant to an insurance agreement,\ntrust, or other funded arrangement. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.171(a).) (b)  The primary purpose of a FB plan under the SCA must be\nto provide systematically for the payment of benefits to employees on account\nof death, disability, advanced age, retirement, illness, medical expenses,\nhospitalization, supplemental employment benefits, and the like. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.171(a)(2).) While not specifically enumerated in the regulations,\nsupplemental unemployment plans and prepaid legal plans are considered “bona\nfide” FBs for purposes of the Act. (c)   Unfunded, self-insured FB plans under which a\ncontractor allegedly makes “out of pocket” payments to provide benefits for\nemployees as costs are incurred, rather than making irrevocable contributions\nto a trust or other funded arrangements, are not normally considered “bona\nfide” plans or equivalent benefits except for plans to provide paid vacation\nand holiday FBs. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.171(b)(1).) (1) \nUnder certain conditions, a\ncontractor may request approval by the Administrator of an unfunded\nself-insured plan in order to allow credit for payments under such a plan in\nmeeting the FB requirements of the Act. The purpose of seeking advance approval\nis to avoid situations involving unfunded plans where monies allegedly\nallocated by a contractor to provide FBs are used for other purposes or are\nrecouped without actually furnishing any benefits. This procedure is not\nintended to prohibit self-insured plans where irrevocable payments are made\npursuant to a trust or other funded arrangement and other conditions are met.\n(See 29 C.F.R. 4.171(b)(2).) (2) \n“Stop loss” insurance payments\nthat provide coverage in the event that claims paid from an unfunded\nself-insured plan exceed specified limits both in the individual and the\naggregate can be credited against the FB obligations of the applicable WD. (d)  Contractors may not take credit for any benefit\nrequired by Federal, State, or local law such as workers’ compensation,\nunemployment compensation, and Social Security contributions. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.171(c).) (e)   The furnishing of facilities which are primarily for\nthe benefit or convenience of the contractor or the cost of which is properly a\nbusiness expense of the contractor is not the furnishing of a “bona fide” FB or\nequivalent benefit or the payment of wages; e.g., items such as relocation expenses,\ntravel and transportation expenses incident to employment, incentive or\nsuggestion awards, etc. Also, a contractor cannot take credit toward its MW and\nFB obligations for the cost of providing social functions or parties for\nemployees, flowers, cards, or gifts on employee birthdays, anniversaries, etc.\n(sunshine funds), employee rest or recreation rooms, paid coffee breaks,\nmagazine subscriptions, and professional or club dues. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.171(d)-(f).)",
