  "text": "(a)   Where the Government enters into a lease/purchase\nagreement D-B applies, because the cost of the construction is eventually paid\nfor by the Government. D-B also applies to a lease option or to a term lease\nagreement where there is substantial and segregable construction activity, and\nwhere the structure is a public building or public work. This may be true, for\nexample, where the building is built at the request of the Government pursuant\nto Government specifications for Government use or purpose for the period of\nthe lease. (b)  AAM #176 identifies the following factors as among\nthose to be considered in determining whether a lease/construction contract is\nconstruction for Davis-Bacon: (1) \n“Length of Lease”, (2) \nExtent of government involvement\nin the construction project (such as whether the building is being built to\nGovernment requirements and whether the Government has the right to inspect the\nprogress of the work), (3) \nThe extent to which the\nconstruction will be used for private rather than public purposes, (4) \nThe extent to which the costs of\nconstruction will be fully paid for by the lease payments. And (5) \nWhether the contract is written as\na lease solely to evade the requirements of the D-B Act. (c)   Postal Service lease agreements are governed by the\nPostal Reorganization Act (39 U.S.C. § 410(d)). Under the terms of that Act,\nPostal Service lease agreements for rent of net interior space in excess of\n6,500 square feet are required to include DB labor standards for any\nconstruction, modification, alteration, repair, painting, decoration, or other\nimprovement of the facility covered by the agreement.",
