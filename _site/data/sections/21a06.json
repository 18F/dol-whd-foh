The principles may be further illustrated in the case of\na tailor, who may make alterations upon clothing in one retail establishment\nwhich was sold in another of his employer’s retail establishments. In such\ncases the tailor at any given time during the week is actually performing\nalterations which are incidental to the specific retail sales of a particular\nretail establishment and is engaged in the work of such exempt establishment\nitself and thus is “employed by” the establishment while so engaged. An\nemployee would not, therefore, be disqualified for exemption in any w/w when he\nis “employed by” an exempt retail establishment at all time during the w/w even\nthough not “employed by” the same exempt establishment for the entire week.\n(See also IB 779.369(g) for the application of this principle to morticians.)",
