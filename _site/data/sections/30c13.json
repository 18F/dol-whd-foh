  "text": "(a)   The\nreasonable cost or fair value of facilities furnished a migrant or seasonal\nagricultural worker are generally creditable as wages. (However, see FOH\n30c03.) Examples of facilities for which deductions or credits are generally\npermissible include: (1)  Meals and\nbeverages actually furnished to the worker. (2)  Off-the-job\ninsurance authorized by the worker. (3)  Canteen\narticles purchased by the worker, but not cigarettes or alcoholic beverages\nsold to the worker, if such sales are determined to be unlawful by appropriate\nlocal law enforcement authorities. Apparent violations of State or local\nlicensing laws should be referred promptly to the appropriate enforcement\nauthority. (See FOH 52a09, 53g03 and 54: WH-124.) Prior to disallowing a\ndeduction or wage credit based upon action by a State or local authority\nconcerning illegal sales, the matter should be discussed through JRC\nprocedures. (4)  Lodging used by\na worker, including utility costs, unless required to be provided free of\ncharge pursuant to the employment contract or applicable law. However, no\ncredit may be taken nor may any charge be made where:                                              \na.     workers\nare required to live on the premises as a condition of employment or where for\nother reasons the housing primarily benefits the employer rather than the\nemployee, or                                              \nb.     the\nhousing has been denied an occupancy permit because of failure to meet\nsubstantive S & H standards as determined by an inspection by any agency,\nor                                              \nc.     S\n& H violations have been found for which MSPA CMPs are being assessed or\nviolations of substantive S & H standards have been found by OSHA, a State,\nor county agency. If the violations are corrected, a charge may be made or a\ncredit taken for such lodging only during the period of compliance. (b)   ETA\nregulations require that workers placed pursuant to a Job Service clearance\norder who are unable to return daily to their permanent residence must receive\nhousing as a term and condition of their employment. Such workers (and\naccompanying family members) must receive housing at no cost or public housing\nwhich meets the Federal and State standards (20 CFR 653.501(d)(2)(xv)). Where\nit appears that a deduction has been made or a wage credit taken in apparent\nviolation of ETA regulations, the matter should be reviewed through JRC before\ndisallowing the deduction or wage credit. (c)   An\nemployer who makes deductions from the wages of workers for board, lodging or\nother facilities or who furnishes such facilities to workers as additions to\nwages is required to maintain records substantiating the cost of such\nfacilities in accordance with Reg 516.27. (d)   In\nMarshall v. Glassboro Service Association. Inc., the Third Circuit affirmed the\ndistrict court’s judgment that money advanced to farm workers for\ntransportation costs from Puerto Rico to the mainland was primarily for the\nbenefit of the employer and therefore could not be deducted from the workers’\nwages to the extent it reduced the wages below the statutory minimum. The court\nsimilarly upheld the district court’s conclusion that FLSA prohibits the\nemployer from taking a wage credit for facilities excluded from wages by the\nterms of a labor agreement which is the functional equivalent of a\ncollective-bargaining agreement. The U.S. Supreme Court denied review. The\nCourt of Appeals also ruled that, regardless of the manner or method by which\nthe employer sought to pass on to its employees certain transportation costs,\nwhere the effect was to bring the wage rate below the statutory minimum, such\npractice was unlawful. (e)   It is the\nWH position that no deduction that cuts into the MW may be made for\ntransportation of migrant workers from the point of hire and return to that\npoint. This is so since in virtually all situations the transportation is\nprimarily for the benefit of the employer and transportation costs are an\nincident of and necessary to the employment of migrant workers. Where an employer\nadvances money to migrant workers to cover transportation expenses from the\npoint of hire to a worksite, the employer may not recoup such advances when to\ndo so results in a worker receiving less than the statutory MW. Such remains\nthe case even though the transportation costs so recovered are accumulated and\nsubsequently returned to the worker at some specified time during the season or\nupon the worker’s return to the point of hire, after the individual has worked\na full season or specified portion thereof. Further, such transportation costs\nmay not be included as part of an employer’s cost of furnishing board, lodging,\nor other facilities. (f)   Farm\nlabor contractors and agricultural associations often provide daily\ntransportation to both migrant and seasonal farmworkers as an integral part of\ntheir business of supplying agricultural workers to those who use their farm\nlabor contracting services. Agricultural employers also transport their own\nworkers under similar circumstances. Such daily transportation is provided to\nassure that sufficient workers will be available at the required time and place\nsince the workers being transported are needed to work upon perishable\ncommodities. Their availability for employment often depends upon being\nprovided transportation. Where alternative transportation is readily available\nwhich the workers are permitted to use (i.e., personal auto or carpool\narrangements) and where they know the location of the place where they are to\nwork, the reasonable cost to an employer (or fair value, whichever is less) in\nproviding transportation may be creditable towards wages. In contrast, where furnishing transportation to\nworkers is primarily for the benefit and convenience of the employer, and is\nnecessary to and an incident of the employment, it is not considered a facility\nwithin the meaning of section 3(m). (See Reg 531.32(a) and (c).) Accordingly,\nit is the WH position that: (1)  Where the\ntransportation is an incident of and necessary to the employment, it is for the\nbenefit of the employer and no deduction may be made for the transportation of\nmigrant or seasonal farmworkers that cuts into the MW. For example,\ntransportation of migrant or seasonal farmworkers from the pickup point and\nreturn to that point, or from the temporary labor camp to the fields or for the\nreturn trip is transportation that is an incident of and necessary to the\nemployment. (2)  Where the\ntransportation is not incidental to the employment, it is for the worker’s\nbenefit and deductions may be made which cut into the MW, provided that if such\ntransportation is subject to MSPA it must be furnished in vehicles which meet\nall substantive Federal and State motor vehicle safety and insurance standards.\nTransportation which is not incidental to the employment (and thus deductible)\nincludes:                                              \na.     the\ntransportation of migrant workers to conduct personal business, such as trips\nfrom the rural temporary labor camp to a laundry, post office, and grocery\nstore, and                                              \nb.     the\ndaily transportation of migrant and seasonal farmworkers, where alternative\ntransportation is readily available, which the workers have the option to use,\nand they know where to report to work but choose to use the employer’s\ntransportation, provided that the transportation is not required to be\nfurnished by law or regulation.",
