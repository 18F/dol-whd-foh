  "text": "(a)  \nThe “reasonable agreement”\nreferred to in IB 785.23 may apply to an employee who resides on the employer’s\npremises five days a week, since such employee may be considered as residing on\nthe employer’s premises “for extended periods of time”. (See Reg 552.102.) (b)  \nOrdinarily, an employee residing\non the employer’s premises for 120 hours or more in a week would meet the\nrequirements of (a) above. Where less than 120 hours in a week are spent\nresiding on the employer’s premises, five consecutive days or nights would also\nqualify as residing on the premises “for extended periods of time.” For\nexample, employees who are on duty from 9 a.m. Monday until 5 p.m. Friday would\nalso be considered to reside on the employer’s premises. Even though on duty\nfor less than 120 hours, they are on duty for five consecutive days (Monday\nthrough Friday). The fact that they sleep over only four nights does not alter\nthis conclusion. Similarly, employees who are on duty from 9 p.m. Monday until\n9 a.m. Saturday would also be considered to reside on their employer’s premises\nsince they are on duty for five consecutive nights (Monday night through Friday\nnight).",
