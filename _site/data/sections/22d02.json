  "text": "(a)  \nAn exempt “learned” professional employee’s primary duty\nmust be the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of\nscience or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized\nintellectual instruction (29 CFR § 541.301(a)).  For further explanation of the\nterm “primary duty,”see the discussion under “executive” at FOH 22b01. 29\nCFR § 541.301(a)  (b)  \n“Work requiring advanced knowledge” means work which is\npredominantly intellectual in character, and which includes work requiring the\nconsistent exercise of discretion and judgment.  Learned professional work is\ntherefore distinguished from work involving routine mental, manual, mechanical\nor physical work.  A learned professional employee generally uses the advanced\nknowledge to analyze, interpret or make deductions from varying facts or\ncircumstances.  Advanced knowledge cannot be attained at the high school\nlevel.   29\nCFR § 541.301(b) (c)  \n“Field(s) of science or learning” include law, medicine,\ntheology, accounting, actuarial computation, engineering, architecture,\nteaching, various types of physical, chemical and biological sciences, pharmacy\nand other similar occupations that have a recognized professional status and\ncan be distinguished from the mechanical arts or skilled trades where the\nknowledge could be of a fairly advanced type, but is not in a field of science\nor learning.  29\nCFR § 541.301(c)  (d)  \nThe phrase “customarily acquired by a prolonged course of\nspecialized intellectual instruction” restricts the learned professional\nexemption to professions where specialized academic training is a standard\nprerequisite for entrance into the profession.  The best evidence of meeting\nthis requirement is having the appropriate academic degree for the particular\nprofession.  However, the word “customarily” means the exemption is available\nto employees in such professions who have substantially the same knowledge\nlevel and perform substantially the same work as the degreed employees, but who\nattained the advanced knowledge through a combination of work experience and\nintellectual instruction.  Thus, for example, the learned professional\nexemption is available to the occasional lawyer who has not gone to law school,\nor the occasional chemist who does not possess a degree in chemistry.  However,\nthe learned professional exemption is not available for occupations that\nrequire only a four-year degree in any field or a two-year degree as a\nprerequisite for entrance into the field. The learned professional exemption is\nnot available for occupations that customarily may be performed with knowledge\nacquired through an apprenticeship, or with training in the performance of routine\nmental, manual, mechanical or physical processes.  The learned professional\nexemption also does not apply to occupations in which most employees acquire\ntheir skill by experience rather than by advanced specialized intellectual\ninstruction.   29\nCFR § 541.301(d) 69\nFR 22150WHD\nLetter FLSA 2005-35NA  Accredited\ncurriculums and certification programs are relevant to determining exempt\nlearned professional status only to the extent they provide evidence that a\nprolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction has become a standard\nprerequisite for entrance into the profession.  Neither the identity of the\ncertifying organization nor the mere fact that certification is required is\ndeterminative if certification does not involve a prolonged course of\nspecialized intellectual instruction.  For example, certified physicians\nassistants meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption\nbecause certification requires four years of specialized post-secondary school\ninstruction; employees with cosmetology licenses are not exempt as learned\nprofessionals because the licenses do not require a prolonged course of\nspecialized intellectual instruction.  In addition, the fact that an employee\npossesses a license to practice a certain profession must be considered along\nwith all the other criteria in determining the exempt status of the employee. \nThe possession of a license permitting an employee to perform duties which\nwould meet the tests of an exempt employee under 29 CFR part 541 does not make\nthat employee necessarily exempt.  In order for an employee to meet the duties\ntests under 29 CFR part 541, the employee must actually perform exempt duties. \n 69\nFR 22157 (e)  \nThe areas in which the professional exemption may be\navailable are expanding.  As knowledge is developed, academic training is\nbroadened and specialized degrees are offered in new and diverse fields, thus\ncreating new specialists in particular fields of science or learning.  When an\nadvanced specialized degree has become a standard requirement for  entrance\ninto a particular occupation, that occupation may have acquired the\ncharacteristics of a learned profession.  Accrediting and certifying\norganizations similar to those listed in 29 CFR § 541.301(e)(1), (e)(3),\n(e)(4), (e)(8) and (e)(9) also may be created in the future.  Such\norganizations may develop similar specialized curriculums and certification\nprograms which, if a standard requirement for a particular occupation, may\nindicate that the occupation has acquired the characteristics of a learned\nprofession.",
