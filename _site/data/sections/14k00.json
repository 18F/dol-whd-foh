  "text": "(a)   The SCA does not provide for compensation of covered\nemployees at premium rates for overtime hours of work. Section 6 of the Act\nrecognizes that other Federal laws, such as the FLSA and CWHSSA may require\nsuch compensation to be paid to employees working on or in connection with\nSCA-covered contracts. CWHSSA (40 U.S.C. 327 - 332) is more limited in scope\nthan the FLSA (29 U.S.C. 201, et seq.) and generally applies to Federal Government\ncontracts in excess of $100,000 that require or involve the employment of\nlaborers, mechanics, guards, and “watchmen.” (See SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.180 - 4.182;\nCWHSSA 29 C.F.R. 5.1 - 5.17; FLSA 29 C.F.R. 778; FOH 15g - k and 32.) (b)  Overtime must be paid at one and one-half times the\nbasic hourly rate (or the regular rate of pay, whichever is higher). (See SCA\n29 C.F.R. 4.180 - 4.182; CWHSSA 29 C.F.R. 5.5(b)(1); FLSA 29 C.F.R. Part 778;\nFOH 15k00 - 15k09 and 32.) (c)   The SCA excludes the amounts paid by a contractor or\nsubcontractor for FBs in the computation of overtime under the FLSA and CWHSSA\nwhenever the overtime provisions of either of those acts apply concurrently\nwith the SCA’s wage provisions. (See SCA 4.177(e), 4.180; FLSA 29 C.F.R.\n778.7.) (d)  Neither the FLSA, nor the CWHSSA, preclude any State,\nterritory, or municipality from implementing its own labor standards with\nrespect to minimum wage and overtime compensation. If Federal and State laws\nhave different requirements, a contractor would be obligated to satisfy both\nsets of standards in order to ensure compliance. (See FLSA 29 C.F.R. 778.5.) (e)   The CWHSSA requires that “liquidated damages shall be\ncomputed, with respect to each individual employed as a laborer or mechanic in\nviolation of any provision of this Act, in the sum of $10 for each calendar day\non which such individual was required or permitted to work in excess of the\nstandard workweek of 40 hours without payment of the overtime required by this\nAct.” In addition, in all cases, liquidated damages are also required to be\ncomputed in situations where an employee is paid overtime at an incorrect basic\nhourly rate of pay. (See CWHSSA 29 C.F.R. 5.8; FOH 15k10.)",
