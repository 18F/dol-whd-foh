  "text": "(a)  \n29 CFR 570.33(i) prohibits the\nemployment of 14- and 15-year-olds in work in freezers and meat coolers.  These\nsame regulations ban most work in the preparation of meat for sale. (b)  \nFor example, minors would be\nprohibited from working as dairy stock clerks handling ice cream, meat clerks,\ndeli clerks, or frozen-food stock clerks, where their duties would require them\nto enter and remain in meat coolers or freezers for prolonged periods of time. \nCL Reg 3 also prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from taking inventory or\nperforming cleanup work which would require the minors to remain in the freezer\nor meat cooler for extended periods of time (see 75 FR 28411-12).   (1)  A meat cooler for purposes of 29 CFR 570.33(i), is any\nconfined, refrigerated area within a retail or food service establishment where\nmeat products are received, cut, trimmed, or otherwise processed, stored and\nhandled.  A meat cooler will often contain equipment such as band saws, meat\ngrinders, slicers, and other dangerous power-driven machinery.  It may also\nhave conveyor systems to move products and a “wrapping station” to package\nproducts. (2)  Not included in the definition of a meat cooler are\nthose coolers that are used merely to store items such as beverages, produce,\ndairy products, and/or prepackaged meat products such as hot dogs, luncheon\nmeats or bacon.   (3)  Also not included in the definition of meat cooler are\nthose refrigerated rooms – often found in convenience stores and located\ndirectly behind and attached to sales cases – from which employees can\nreplenish stocks of beverages, dairy products (non-frozen), and prepackaged\nmeat products.   (c)  \nFourteen- and 15-year-old\nemployees may occasionally enter freezers only momentarily to retrieve items\n(see 29 CFR 570.34(i)).  For example, a minor who works in an ice cream shop\nmay occasionally be required to enter a freezer to obtain a new carton of ice\ncream.  In such circumstances, the minor is not considered to be working in a\nfreezer.  Such minors may not enter meat coolers, even momentarily.",
