  "text": "Eligibility standards are\npermissible in an otherwise “bona fide” fringe benefit plan under DBRA.\nHowever, an employer must make payments or incur costs in the applicable\nspecified amounts with respect to each individual laborer or mechanic\nperforming covered contract work. Employees who are excluded from a plan for\nwhatever reason and for whom the employer makes no contribution must be paid in\ncash. For example, many hospitalization plans require a waiting period of 30\ndays before an employee can participate in the plan. Since the employer\nnormally makes no contribution for the employee during the waiting period, the\nemployee must be paid the fringe benefit in cash or furnished other bona fide\nfringe benefits equal in monetary value. If the plan requires contributions to\nbe made during the eligibility waiting period, credit may be taken for such\ncontributions. Since it is not required that all employees participating in a\nbona fide fringe benefit plan be entitled to receive benefits from that plan at\nall times, however, credit may not be taken for contributions for employees who\nby definition are not eligible to participate, such as employees who are\nexcluded because of age or part-time employment. Similarly, employers\nfrequently make contributions to union fringe benefit funds for employees who\nare not members of the union. If the employee cannot participate in or receive\nbenefits from the union fund, the employee must be paid the fringe benefits in\ncash, even though the employer, by the terms of his union contract, may be\nrequired to contribute to the union fringe benefit fund on behalf of such\nemployees.",
