  "text": "(a)  \nTravel time spent in carrying\nheavy burdensome equipment, as contrasted with light hand tools, is hours\nworked. On the other hand, carrying light hand tools between an employee’s home\nand his work site, involving no appreciable burden or inconvenience, is not\nhours worked. In determinations of this kind, some consideration must be given\nto the custom in the industry. For example, it is not a part of a carpenter’s\nprincipal activities for him to carry his usual tool box, containing hammer,\nsaw, et cetera, from his home to his work site. (b)  \nAn employee who is required\nregularly to carry heavy mail or bulky packages to the post office en route\nfrom the factory to his home, is working. A different situation exists if an\nemployee carries only light mail to and from the post office on the way to or\nfrom work, and generally the time so spent is not hours worked. The following supersedes FOH\n31c05 (this reverses the prior position of WH concerning travel time by\nhomeworkers): INSERT #1763 (8/8/88)",
