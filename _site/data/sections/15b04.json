  "text": "(a)   The D-B Act provides that every covered contract must\ncontain a stipulation that the contractor or subcontractor must pay all\nmechanics and laborers “employed directly upon the site of the work” at wage\nrates not less than those stated in the advertised specifications. The Related\nActs which provide for Federal construction assistance contain no reference to\n“site of the work”. However, 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(1)(i) prescribes a contract clause\nwhich in effect extends the “site of the work” concept to the Related Acts.\nCertain HUD Related Acts, including the United States Housing Act of 1937 and\nthe Housing Act of 1949, however, specifically require payment of not less than\nthe wage rates prescribed to all mechanics and laborers employed “in the\nconstruction and development of the project”. In short there is no “site of the\nwork” concept with respect to the United States Housing Act of 1937 or the\nHousing Act of 1949. (It should be noted that the OT requirements of CWHSSA\napply to all laborers and mechanics performing contract work, regardless of the\nsite of their employment. See FOH l5g03.) (b)  The D-B Act limits coverage to laborers and mechanics\nemployed on the “site of the work” but does not define this term. “Site of the\nwork” is defined in 29 CFR § 5.2(l). The description below provides general\nguidance used by WHD in D-B and DBRA investigations: (1) \nThe “site of the work” is the\nphysical place or places where the building or work called for in the contract\nwill remain and any other site where a significant portion of the building or\nwork is constructed, provided that such site is established specifically for\nthe performance of the contract or project. (29 CFR § 5.2(l)(1)) For example:                                             \na.     if a small office building is being erected, the “site\nof work” will normally include no more than the building itself and its\ngrounds.                                             \nb.     In the case of larger contracts, such as for airports,\nhighways, or dams, the “site of the work” is necessarily more extensive and may\ninclude the whole area in which the construction activity will take place.                                              \nc.     Where a very large segment of the dam is constructed\nup-river and floated downstream to be affixed onto a support structure, the\nsecondary construction site would be within the meaning of “site of the work”\nfor Davis-Bacon purposes if it was established for and dedicated to the dam\nconstruction project. (2) \nExcept as provided in paragraph 29\nCFR § 5.2(l)(3), batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards, etc.,\nare part of the “site of work” provided they are dedicated exclusively or\nnearly so to the contract or project, and are adjacent or virtually adjacent to\nthe site of the work as defined in 29 CFR § 5.2(l)(1). (3) \nNot included in the ”site of the work”\nare permanent home offices, branch plant establishments, fabrication plants,\nand tool yards, etc. of a contractor or subcontractor whose locations and\ncontinuance in operation are determined wholly without regard to a particular\nFederal or federally-assisted contract or project.  Also excluded from the “site of the work” are\nfabrication plants, batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards,\netc, of a commercial or material supplier which are established by a supplier\nof materials for the project before opening of bids and not on the site of the\nwork as stated in 29 CFR § 5.2(l)(1), even where such operations for a period\nof time may be dedicated exclusively, or nearly so, to the performance of a\ncontract. (c)   Once the limits of “site of the work” have been\ndetermined, the wage determination applies only to those mechanics and laborers\nemployed by a contractor or subcontractor on the site of the work. (d)  In 2000, DOL revised the two related definitions in\nthe regulations that set forth rules for the administration and enforcement of\nthe Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements. Revisions in the regulatory\ndefinitions of “site of the work” and “construction, prosecution, completion,\nor repair” were made to clarify the regulatory requirements in view of three U.\nS. appellate court decisions, which had concluded that DOL’s application of\nthese related regulatory definitions was at odds with the language of the\nDavis-Bacon Act that limits coverage to workers employed “directly upon the\nsite of the work,”.  For a full discussion of the\nrevisions made to the regulatory definition of the “site of the work” in 2000,\nsee the final rule published in the Federal Register on December 20, 2000, 65\nFR 80268-80278. (see also Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO\nv. United States Department of Labor Wage Appeals Board, 932 F.2d 985(D.C. Cir\n1991) (Midway), Ball, Ball and Brosamer v. Reich (D.C. Cir 1994) and Cavett\nCompany v. U.S. Department of Labor 101 F. 3d 1111 (6th Cir. 1996).  (e)   The FAR (48 CFR §§ 52.222.5 through .11) has been\nrevised to address the issue of secondary sites that may be considered to be\nwithin the regulatory definition of “site of the work”. Therefore, federal\ncontract stipulations include provisions that address the possibility of a\ncovered secondary site of work.
