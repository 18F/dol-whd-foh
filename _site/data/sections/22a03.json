  "text": "The\nexemptions provided by 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) are applied on the basis that each\nworkweek constitutes a separate period of exemption.  However, certain of the\ntests are so worded that a determination of exemption must be made by\nconsidering the conditions of employment over a more extended period of time. \nFor example, the “primary duty” test does not expressly apply on a workweek\nbasis and must be applied using a holistic approach that is sufficient to\ncapture the character of the employee’s job as a whole (29 CFR § 541.700; 69 FR\n22186), rather than a day-by-day scrutiny of the tasks performed.  Similarly,\nan employee may be paid the salary required during certain workweeks, but an\nanalysis of the compensation paid over a longer period may reveal that the\nemployee is not actually paid “on a salary basis.”  Likewise, investigation may\nreveal that a supervisor does not “customarily and regularly” direct the work\nof two or more employees in his or her department, despite the fact that in\nparticular weeks the supervisor may supervise more than one employee.  It must\nalways be kept in mind, however, that a change in an employee’s duties,\nresponsibilities, or salary (even though temporary) may bring a change in\nexemption status.",
