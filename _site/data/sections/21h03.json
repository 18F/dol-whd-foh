  "text": "(a)   A week-by-week determination of the regular rate for\npurposes of Sec 7(i)(1) is not necessary if the earnings are consistently and\nobviously higher than required to meet the test. However, situations may be\nencountered where the test is not clearly met and specific determinations of the\nregular rate for particular weeks are required. This will present no difficulty\nin the ordinary case. However, if the employee is paid commissions under a pay\nplan involving balancing factors, complex problems as to the regular rate are\nraised. For example, a guarantee plan may operate on a formula basis which\nreflects the cumulative effect of the employee’s sales work with the\nunderstanding that additional payments will be made when the amount due from\ncommissions over the period exceeds the total compensation previously paid. Or,\nthe guarantee plan may include a provision that if commissions allocable to a\nparticular w/w fail short of the guarantee the amount of the insufficiency will\nbe carried forward as a “deficit” and deducted from an “overage” in some future\nw/w. In such cases the CO shall obtain the facts as to the operation of the pay\nplan and submit the matter through channels to the RS for an opinion. (b)  In determining whether or not the employee’s R/R of\npay is in excess of 1 1/2 times the minimum hourly wage as required by sec\n7(i)(1) of the FLSA, the employer may divide the employee’s total earnings\nattributed to the pay period by the employee’s total hours worked during such\npay period. Total earnings include commissions, any part of a draw that exceeds\ncommissions, and supplemental payments, if any, that may have been paid to the\nemployee. Supplemental payments means payments that have been made in order to\nincrease the employee’s earnings to an amount in excess of 1 1/2 times the\nminimum hourly wage.",
