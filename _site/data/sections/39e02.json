  "text": "(a)   General An eligible employee\nmay choose, or the employer may require the employee, to substitute accrued\npaid leave for FMLA leave.  Substitute means that the paid leave provided by\nthe employer will run concurrently with the unpaid FMLA leave. (b)   Accrued\npaid leave For the purpose of\nsubstituting accrued paid leave, the employee must have both earned the leave\nand be able to use that leave during the FMLA leave period.  The employer may\nnot require the employee to substitute leave that is not yet available to the\nemployee to use under the terms of the employer's leave plan. This, however, would\nneither prevent an employer from voluntarily advancing paid leave to an\nemployee nor an employee from voluntarily accepting such leave during an FMLA\nabsence. WHD Non-Administrator\nLetter FMLA-81 June 18, 1996WHD Non-Administrator\nLetter FMLA-61 May 12, 1995 (c)   Adherence\nto employer’s leave policy When accrued paid\nleave is substituted, the employee receives pay pursuant to the employer’s\napplicable paid leave policy during the otherwise unpaid FMLA leave.  An\nemployee’s ability to substitute accrued paid leave is determined by the terms\nand conditions of the employer’s normal leave policy.  For example, pursuant to\nan employer’s uniform policy for all employees, an employer may request a\ndoctor’s note in order for the employee to receive paid sick leave.  The\nemployer must inform the employee that he or she must satisfy any procedural\nrequirements of the paid leave policy to receive payment for the substituted\nleave.  If the employee does not comply with the additional requirements of the\nemployer’s paid leave policy, the employee is no longer entitled to substitute\naccrued paid leave, but remains entitled to take unpaid FMLA leave. (d)   Concurrent\nuse of FMLA and other paid leaves (1)  Leave taken\npursuant to a disability leave plan, which also meets the definition of a\nserious health condition under the FMLA, may be counted against the employee’s\nFMLA leave entitlement.  A serious health condition may result from an injury\non or off the job and leave for an injury meeting the FMLA criteria may be\ndesignated by the employer as FMLA leave. (2)  Because leave\nunder a disability benefit plan or workers’ compensation program is not unpaid,\nthe provision for substitution of accrued paid leave does not apply, and\nneither the employee nor the employer may require the substitution of paid\nleave.  However, employers and employees may agree, where state law permits, to\nhave accrued paid leave supplement the paid plan benefits, such as in a case\nwhere a plan only provides two-thirds of an employee’s salary. (3)  Section 7(o) of\nthe FLSA permits public employers, under certain conditions, to substitute\ncompensatory time off at one and one-half hours for each overtime hour worked\nin lieu of paying cash to employees who work overtime.  If an employee requests\nand is permitted to use accrued compensatory time concurrently with FMLA leave,\nor the employer requires its use, the time may be counted against the\nemployee’s FMLA entitlement. 29 USC 2612(d)29 C.F.R. 825.20773 FR 67934, 67979-67983",
