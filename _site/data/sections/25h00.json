This includes not only the\ntypical hospital employees who work in the hospital but may also include, for\nexample, employees of an employer who owns and operates or operates pursuant to\na contract more than one hospital, who are engaged in performing the following\nservices for the hospitals: public relations, payroll, accounting,\nadministrative services, engineering, architecture and planning, community\nrelations, and personnel and labor relations and remodeling (2)  Employees employed in hospital operations. Employees in the\nvarious medical laboratories and therapy services located in the hospital and\noperated by the employer exclusively as an integral and essential part of the\nhospital may be subject to Sec 7(j). Such employees must be employed in\nmedically related activities connected with the operation of the hospital. On\nthe other hand where the laboratory or therapy services are only providing a\nservice to the hospital and operate as an independent business which is not\npart of the hospital enterprise, Sec 7(j) will not apply to their employees\nbecause they are not deemed “employed by” an ‘employer engaged in the operation\nof a hospital”. Similarly, an independent contractor providing nonmedically\nrelated services, such as a contractor who provides janitorial or maintenance\nservices to a hospital may not use Sec 7(j) since the contractor is not engaged\nin the medically related operations of a hospital. Further, an employer engaged in the operation of a hospital may not\nutilize the provision to relieve himself of his obligations under Sec 7(a) of\nthe Act with respect to any of his employees who devote a substantial part of\ntheir worktime in the w/w to activities other than those in connection with the\noperation of the hospital, such as custodial work for other tenants who occupy\nleased space in the building. Such nonexempt work wilt be considered\nsubstantial if it occupies more than 20% of the time worked by the employee in\nthe w/w. (c)  \nEmployees of a temporary help\ncompany working on assignments in hospitals are considered to be jointly\nemployed by both the temporary help company and the hospital in which they are\nemployed. For enforcement purposes, Wage-Hour will not take exception to a\nclaim by a hospital that Sec 7(j) applies during any 14-day period where the\nemployees work exclusively for a single hospital provided that before\nperformance of the work am agreement is made between the hospital and the\nemployees to use the 14-day period in lieu of the normal w/w. This position is\ntaken without prejudice to the rights of individual employees under Sec 16(b).\nOn the other hand, Sec 7(j) will not apply to any employee who during a 14-day\nwork period is employed in more than one hospital even though all such\nhospitals may be operating under Sec 7(j) with respect to their regular\nemployees.",
