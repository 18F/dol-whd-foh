  "text": "(a)   Employees performing on most SCA food service,\nsecurity guard service, nursing home service, and janitorial service contracts\nare required by the employer, by the employer’s Government contract, by law, or\nby the nature of the work, to wear clean uniforms and/or related apparel or\nequipment. In such situations, the financial cost of furnishing and maintaining\n(except in the case of wash and wear uniforms, see (d) below) clean uniforms or\nequipment is considered to be a business expense of the employer and may not be\nimposed upon the employees if to do so would reduce their wages below the FLSA\nMW or SCA prevailing wage rate (or FLSA or CWHSSA OT). Where the MW (or OT) is\ndiminished below the required rate, the employer must bear the cost of\nproviding clean uniforms and equipment up to the amount of any such deficiency.\n(See 29 C.F.R. 4.168(b).) (b)  A determination of the cost of furnishing the uniforms\n(and related equipment) itself presents no problem. If the employee is required\nto furnish the uniform, the actual cost incurred by the employee shall be used\nto ascertain whether a MW or OT violation has occurred. The same is true where\na commercial laundry or uniform rental services is utilized. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.168(b); FOH 30c12.) (c)   Where uniform cleaning and maintenance is the\nresponsibility of the employee, a contractor may satisfy its wage obligation\nunder the Act by reimbursing employees $3.35/wk or $.67/day for such cleaning\nand maintenance. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.168(b)(1)(ii).) (d)  There generally is no requirement that employees be\nreimbursed where the uniforms furnished are made of “wash and wear” materials\nwhich may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments and\nrequire no special treatment such as daily washing, dry cleaning or commercial\nlaundering. This limitation does not apply, however, where a different\nprovision has been set forth in the applicable WD. In the case of WDs issued\nunder Section 4(c) of the Act for successor contracts, the amount established\nby the parties to the predecessor CBA is deemed to be the cost of laundering\nuniforms. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.168(b)(2).)",
