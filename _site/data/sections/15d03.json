  "text": "(a)   To determine whether a demolition contract is subject\nto DBRA, it is necessary to look at the entire scope of that contract as well\nas other contracts that might be part of the same overall project. Demolition,\nstanding alone, (except for demolition work under Urban Renewal projects\nauthorized pursuant to the Housing Act of 1949, as amended) is not necessarily\nconsidered to be “construction, alteration, and/or repair of a public building\nor a public work” subject to the prevailing wage requirements of DBRA. For\nexample, the demolition of a building because such structure is no longer\nneeded would not in itself be a covered construction activity. However, where\nan existing building is being demolished and further construction activity at\nthe site is contemplated that is subject to DBRA, DBRA would apply to such\ndemolition, such as demolition performed to permit construction of a new\nbuilding or highway (AAM # 190, see also FOH 14d08). (b)  In some cases, the nature of the demolition or removal\nwork alone might be considered construction activity covered by DBA. Removal of\nasbestos or paint from a facility that will not be demolished would be\nconsidered to be an alteration or repair (AAM # 153) and certain hazardous\nwaste removal contracts that involve substantial earth moving to remove\ncontaminated soil and re-contour the surface may be considered construction\n(AAM # 187).",
