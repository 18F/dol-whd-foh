  "text": "(a)   Employees of a railroad company\nmanufacturing ice are within the Sec 13(b)(2) exemption where the ice is made\nsolely for use by the railroad. (b)   The loading and unloading of livestock by\nemployees of a public stockyard onto and from railroad cars is within the Sec\n13(b)(2) exemption, but other stockyard activities, such as the yarding,\nfeeding, watering, and handling of livestock before or after the loading or\nunloading operations, are not within the exemption. (c)   For purposes of the old Sec l3(b)(2)\nexemption during the period prior to 5/1/74, employees of a carrier engaged in\nthe transportation of oil by pipeline within a State as part of an interstate\nsystem of transportation (or connecting with such a transportation system),\nuninterrupted by processing, were within Sec l3(b)(2) because such activities\nare subject to regulation under Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act. This was\ntrue even though a firm was transporting only its own products in its own\npipeline or gathering system since the term “common carrier” in such Act\nincluded all pipelines. (A line laid on an oil lease to move crude oil from the\nwell-head to a lease storage tank, or from one lease storage tank to another,\nis not considered to be a “common carrier”.) (d)   For the period prior to 5/1/74,\nactivities involving the blending of gasoline by employees employed by a\npipeline company which was a carrier subject to Part I of the Interstate\nCommerce Act were exempt under FLSA Sec 13(b)(2).",
