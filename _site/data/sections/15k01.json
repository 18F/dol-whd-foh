  "text": "(a)   The CWHSSA contains no MW standards; MW standards\nresult from the application of DBRA prevailing wage rate determinations, SCA\nprevailing wage rate determinations, or the FLSA MW. The basic rate of pay\nunder CWHSSA is the straight time hourly rate and cannot be less than the basic\nhourly rate required in an applicable wage determination. Under DBRA, amounts\npaid as fringe benefits – both contributions to bona fide benefit plans and\ncash payments made to meet wage determination fringe benefits requirements –\nare excluded in computing overtime obligations under CWHSSA. (b)  If an employee worked in more than one classification\nand at different rates on covered contracts during a workweek, the overtime\npremium is computed based on the regular rate of pay. The regular rate is the\nweighted average of the rates; that is, the total earnings (except statutory\nexclusions) at the different rates are divided by the total number of hours\nworked in the w/w. Overtime may be computed based on the rate in effect during\nthe hours worked over 40 in the workweek provided the provisions of FLSA §\n7(g)(1) or (2) are met. (See 29 CFR §§ 778.6, 778.115 and 778.415-419.)",
