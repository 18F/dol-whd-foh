This does not mean, however, that the only activities within a banking\nenterprise are those which constitute banking in its most narrow sense.\nIncluded in the enterprise of a bank, for example, where conducted under\nunified operation or common control for a common business purpose, would be\nthose real estate operations incidental to a bank’s lending money and providing\nhousing for the conduct of its business. Thus, the operation of the bank\nbuilding or other buildings acquired as an incident to its banking operation,\neven though such buildings are occupied by tenants other than the bank, would\nbe within the banking enterprise. The operation by the bank itself or a\nsubsidiary corporation of a parking lot or garage in conjunction with such a\nbuilding for the purpose of providing parking accommodations for customers of\nthe bank and the building tenants would likewise be included.  (See IB\n779.206(b).)",
