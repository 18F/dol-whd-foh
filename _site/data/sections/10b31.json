For example, an office employee of the city may volunteer to\nperform nonclerical services, such as coaching a softball or basketball team in\na city-sponsored program during his or her off-duty time as a charitable or\ncivil act. Similarly a person may participate in the civil defense program for\ncivil or personal motives. Where a person performs such volunteer services\nwithout promise or expectation of compensation, at hours that suit his or her\nown convenience whether by schedule or otherwise, and where no regular employee\nis replaced in the performance of normal duties, no employer-employee\nrelationship exists with respect to such time. The activity may be performed on\nthe employer’s premises so long as it is not done during any time the employee\nis required to be on the premises and the control exercised by the employer is\nonly minimal. A person, however, may not be both an employee and a volunteer\nwhile performing essentially the same duties. Thus, for example, a person\nemployed in park activities cannot have his or her time divided into “working\nhours” and “volunteer hours” while performing the same or related duties.",
