The primary function of such employees is to take measurements\nand to accumulate data upon which recommendations are based to advise\nmechanical contractors how to rectify imperfections or imbalances in heating\nand air conditioning systems which may become apparent after the contractor(s)\nhave installed such systems. Generally, however, such employees do not\nphysically make the required corrections. If, however, such employees spend a\nsubstantial amount of their time in any workweek (i.e., more than 20 percent)\non the site performing manual, physical, and mechanical functions which are\nthose of a traditional craftsperson, they would be considered laborers or\nmechanics for the time so spent.",
