  "text": "Name:  Occupations in Excavation Operations Originally Adopted:  May 9, 1963 (a)  \nScope of HO 17 (1)  Individuals employed in excavation operations (which\nincludes trenching, building excavation, tunneling, and shaft sinking) are\nexposed to injury producing hazards such as cave-ins, falls climbing in and out\nof the excavated site, working in close proximity with heavy earth moving\nmachines, and the fall of rock from the sides and roof of the site.  Excavation\noperations were selected for study, according to the report establishing HO 17,\nbecause several states had requested an investigation by the Department and\nbecause the Department had received many reports concerning minors being injured\nwhile employed in excavation operations.  Fatalities and injuries resulting\nfrom cave-ins are still a problem in the construction industry.  On April 17,\n1998, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) issued a\n“warning” concerning the danger of cave-ins.  This report stated that six\nworkers were killed by cave-ins in the first four months of 1998, and that, on\naverage, 60 people die each year in accidents caused by cave-ins.  (2)  HO 17 is process specific.  The scope of HO 17\nincludes all work excavating, working in, and backfilling trenches; excavating\nfor buildings or other structures and working in such excavations; driving\ntunnels; and sinking shafts, except in certain specified situations (see FOH\n33h17(c)).  It does not include site clearing or surface grading operations,\ndredging and bore-hole drilling operations, and mining and quarrying operations\ncovered by HO 3 and HO 9.  (3)  Definitions  a.    \nThe term excavation operation\nmeans the removal of earth, rock, or other material to form a cavity below the\nsurface of the ground.   b.    \nThe term trenches includes ditches\n(see Acting Administrator Flynn's letter of January 24, 1990). c.    \nThe term angle of repose is that\nangle where the soil comprising the cut side walls no longer moves or it is at\nrest. (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED (1)  HO 17 prohibits minors from working in occupations in\nexcavating, working in, or backfilling (refilling) trenches [except they may\nmanually excavate/backfill and work in trenches which do not exceed four feet\nin depth at any point (see FOH 33h17(c)(1)).  (2)  HO 17 prohibits minors from working in occupations in\nexcavating for buildings or other structures, or working in such excavations\n[except they may manually excavate to a depth not exceeding four feet below any\nground surface adjoining the excavation and they may work in any excavation not\nexceeding four feet or where the side walls are shored or sloped to the angle\nof repose (see FOH 33h17(c)(2)). (3)  HO 17 prohibits minors from working in tunnels prior\nto the completion of all driving and shoring operations.  (4)  HO 17 prohibits minors from working within shafts\nprior to the completion of all sinking and shoring operations. (c)  \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED (1)  Trenches.  Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may manually\nexcavate, manually backfill, and work in trenches which do not exceed four feet\nin depth at any point.  (2)  Excavating for buildings and other structure a.    \nSixteen- and 17-year-olds may\nmanually excavate to a depth not exceeding four feet below any ground surface\nadjoining the excavation. b.    \nSixteen- and 17-year-olds may work\nin an excavation not exceeding a depth of four feet.  c.    \nSixteen- and 17-year-olds may\nworking in an excavation where the side walls are shored or sloped to the angle\nof repose. (3)  HO 17 does not apply to site clearing or surface\ngrading operations, nor to dredging and bore-hole drilling operations.  (d)  \nExemptions HO 17 does contain an exemption for student-learners and apprentices. \nThere are no other exemptions applicable to this order. (e)  \nEnforcement positions Road graders The use of road graders (power-driven earth moving equipment) in\nexcavation operations is prohibited by HO 17.  The study conducted by the\nDepartment that established HO 17 did not include surface grading operations\n(i.e. use of road graders).  However, as HO 17 only permits manual excavation\nor backfilling and only at a depth of up to four feet – and road graders\nconstitute mechanized excavation, often in ditches up to six feet in depth – the\nuse of road graders is prohibited.",
