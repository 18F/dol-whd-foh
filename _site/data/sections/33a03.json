  "text": "(a)  \nCoverage under § 12(c) is\ndependent upon a minor being employed in commerce or in the production of goods\nfor commerce, or in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of\ngoods for commerce.  Section 12(c) coverage is based upon either the minor’s\nperformance of individually covered activities or employment in a covered\nenterprise.  If such a minor is employed under these circumstances a violation\nof § 12(c) would occur regardless of where he or she may be employed or what\nhis employer may do and regardless of whether there is a “removal” of goods or\na shipment or delivery for shipment in commerce.   (b)  \nCoverage under § 12(a) on the\nother hand, often said to apply on an “establishment” basis, is dependent upon\nthe performance of duties in or about an establishment producing goods for commerce\nrather than upon the nature of the work performed by the minor employee or by\nthe nature of the enterprise.  Section 12(a) coverage does not require that the\nminor whose employment constitutes oppressive child labor be covered on an\nenterprise or individual basis.  The provisions of § 12(a) would still apply in\na situation in which an under-age employee does not engage in the production of\ngoods themselves if somewhere in the establishment in or about which they are\nemployed goods are “produced” which are subsequently shipped or delivered for\nshipment in commerce.   (c)   Section 12(a) does not directly exclude the employment\nof oppressive CL.  Instead, it prohibits the shipment or delivery for shipment\nin interstate or foreign commerce of goods produced in an establishment where\noppressive CL has been employed within thirty days before removal of the\ngoods.  Section 12(c), on the other hand, is a direct prohibition against the\nemployment of oppressive CL in commerce, or in the production of goods for commerce.",
