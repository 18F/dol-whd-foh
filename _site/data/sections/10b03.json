  "text": "(a)           \nThere is no special provision in the FLSA which precludes an\nemployee-employer relationship between a religious, charitable or nonprofit\norganization and persons who perform work for such an organization. For\nexample, a church or religious order may operate an establishment to print\nbooks, magazines, or other publications and employ a regular staff who do this\nwork as a means of livelihood. In such cases there is an employee-employer\nrelationship for purposes of the Act. (b)           \nPersons such as nuns, monks, priests, lay brothers, ministers,\ndeacons, and other members of religious orders who serve pursuant to their\nreligious obligations in the schools, hospitals, and other institutions\noperated by their church or religious order shall not be considered to be “employees”.\nHowever, the fact that such a person is a member of a religious order does not\npreclude an employee-employer relationship with a State or secular institution. (c)           \nIn many cases the nature of religious, charitable and similar\nnonprofit organizations, and schools is such that individuals may volunteer\ntheir services in one capacity or another, usually on a part-time basis, not as\nemployees or in contemplation of pay for the services rendered. For example,\nmembers of civic organizations may help out in a sheltered workshop; women’s\norganizations may send members or students into hospitals or nursing homes to\nprovide certain personal services for the sick or the elderly; mothers may\nassist in a school library or cafeteria as a public duty to maintain effective\nservices for their children; or fathers may drive a school bus to carry a\nfootball team or band on a trip. Similarly, individuals may volunteer to\nperform such tasks as driving vehicles or folding bandages for the Red Cross,\nworking with children with disabilities or disadvantaged youth, helping in\nyouth programs as camp counselors, scoutmasters, den mothers, providing child\ncare assistance for needy working mothers, soliciting contributions or\nparticipating in benefit programs for such organizations and volunteering other\nservices needed to carry out their charitable, educational, or religious\nprograms. The fact that services are performed under such circumstances is not\nsufficient to create an employee-employer relationship. (d)           \nAlthough the volunteer services (as described in (c) above) are\nnot considered to create an employment relationship, the organizations for\nwhich they are performed will generally also have employees performing\ncompensated service whose employment is subject to the standards of the Act.\nWhere such an employment relationship exists, the Act requires payment of not\nless than the statutory wages for all hours “worked” in the w/w. However, there\nare certain circumstances where such an employee may donate services as a\nvolunteer, and the time so spent is not considered to be compensable “work”.\nFor example, an office employee of a hospital may volunteer to sit with a sick\nchild or elderly person during off-duty hours as an act of charity. WH will not\nconsider that an employee-employer relationship exists with respect to such\nvolunteer time between the establishment and the volunteer or between the\nvolunteer and the person for whose benefit the service is performed. Another\nexample is where an office employee of a church may volunteer to perform\nnon-clerical services in the church preschool during off duty time from his or\nher office work as an act of charity. Conversely, a preschool employee may\nvolunteer to perform work in some other facet of the church’s operations\nwithout an employment relationship being formed with respect to such volunteer\ntime. However, this does not mean that a regular office employee of a\ncharitable organization can volunteer services on an uncompensated basis to\nhandle correspondence in connection with a special fund drive or to handle\nother work arising from exigencies of the operations conducted by the employer. (e)           \nAs part of their overall educational program, public or private\nschools and institutions of higher learning may permit or require students to\nengage in activities in connection with dramatics, student publications, glee\nclubs, bands, choirs, debating teams, radio stations, intramural and\ninterscholastic athletics and other similar endeavors. Activities of students\nin such programs, conducted primarily for the benefit of the participants as a\npart of the educational opportunities provided to the students by the school or\ninstitution, are not “work” of the kind contemplated by Sec 3(g) of the Act and\ndo not result in an employee-employer relationship between the student and the\nschool or institution. Also, the fact that a student may receive a minimal\npayment for participation is such activities would not necessarily create an\nemployment relationship. (f)           \nThe sole fact that a student helps in a school lunchroom or\ncafeteria for periods of 30 minutes to an hour per day in exchange for their\nlunch is not considered to be sufficient to make him or her an employee of the\nschool, regardless of whether he or she performs such work regularly or only on\noccasion. Also, the fact that students on occasion do some cleaning up of a\nclassroom, serve the school as junior patrol officers or perform minor clerical\nwork in the school office or library for periods of an hour per day or less\nwithout contemplation of compensation or in exchange or a meal or for a cash\namount reasonably equivalent to the price of a meal or, when a cash amount is\ngiven in addition to a meal, it is only a nominal sum, is not considered\nsufficient in itself to characterize the students as employees of the school. A\nsimilar policy will be followed where the students perform such tasks less\nfrequently but for a full day, with an arrangement to perform their academic\nwork for such days at other times. For example, the students may perform\nfull-day cafeteria service four times per year. In such cases, the time devoted\nto cafeteria work in the aggregate would be less than if the student worked an\nhour per day. However, if there are other indicia of employment or the students\nnormally devote more than an hour each day or equivalent to such work, the\ncircumstances of the arrangement should be reviewed carefully. (g)           \nIn the ordinary case, tasks performed as a normal part of a\nprogram of treatment, rehabilitation, or vocational training in the following\nsituations will not be considered, under Sec 3(g) of the Act, as “work” of a\nkind requiring a hospital patient, school student, or institutional inmate to\nbe considered an employee of the hospital, school, or institution conducting\nthe program, for purposes of the FLSA: tasks performed by individuals committed\nto training schools of a correctional nature, which are required as a part of\nthe correctional program of the institution as a part of the institutional\ndiscipline and by reason of their value in providing needed therapy,\nrehabilitation, or training to help prepare the inmate to become\nself-sustaining in a lawful occupation after release (h)          \nWH will not assert that initial participation by a student with\ndisabilities in a school-work program constitutes an employment relationship if\ncertain conditions are met. However, after an employment relationship has\ndeveloped, the provisions of the Act will be applicable. (i)            \nThe conditions under which an employment relationship initially\nwill not be asserted are: (1)          \nThe activities are basically educational, are conducted primarily\nfor the benefit of the participants, and comprise one of the facets of the\neducational opportunities provided to the students. The student may receive\nsome payment for their work in order to have a more realistic work situation,\nor as an incentive to the student or to insure that the employer will treat the\nstudent as a worker. (2)          \nThe time in attendance at the school plus the time in attendance\nat the experience station (either in the school or with an outside employer)\ndoes not substantially exceed the time the student would be required to attend\nschool if following a normal academic schedule. Time in excess of 1 hour beyond\nthe normal school schedule or attendance at the experience station on days when\nschool is not in session would be considered substantial. (j)            \nThe student does not displace a regular employee or impair the\nemployment opportunities of others by performing work which would otherwise be\nperformed by regular employees who would be employed by the school or an\nindependent contractor including, for example, employees of a contractor\noperating the food service facilities at the school. (k)          \nThe shift to an employment relationship may occur shortly after\nthe placement or it may occur later. As a general guide, work for a particular\nemployer, either a private employer or the school, after 3 months will be\nassumed by WH to be part of an employment relationship unless the facts\nindicate that the training situation has not materially changed. Thus, if the\nconditions which warranted the finding that the student is not considered an\nemployee continue, he or she may remain for a period of time as a trainee\nrather than an employee. On the other hand, if after the 3-month period the\ntraining aspects are subordinated and the work aspects clearly predominate, the\nstudent will be considered as an employee.",
