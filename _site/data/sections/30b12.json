  "text": "Certain employment, such as that in schools,\ndoes not normally constitute 12 months of actual work each year. For the\nconvenience of the employee, the annual salary earned during the duty months is\noften paid in equal monthly installments throughout the entire year. In\ndetermining whether the statutory MW has been paid in such cases, the annual\nsalary is considered in relation to the duty months rather than in relation to\nthe entire year. Thus, for example, a school bus driver may receive an annual\nsalary of $6,000 for 10 months’ duty but be paid twelve equal monthly\ninstallments of $500 each. In such case, the employee is considered as being\npaid at the salary rate of $600 per month or $138.46 per week. Compliance with\nthe statutory MW is determined in the usual manner based on this weekly salary.\n(See FOH 22b11 and 32b08.)",
