  "text": "(a)  \nTip credit Section\n3(m) of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. 203(m), permits an employer meeting all of the\nrequirements of that section to take a \"tip credit\" as part of the\nSec. 6(a)(1) wage it is required to pay its tipped employees and further\nprovides that the “wage” of a tipped employee equals the sum of the direct or\ncash wage paid by the employer (which cannot be less than $2.13 per hour) and\nthe additional amount the employer is using as a credit against tips received,\nwhich cannot exceed the difference between the minimum wage specified in Sec.\n6(a)(1) of the FLSA and the direct or cash wage paid.  See FOH 30d for a full\ndiscussion of the tip credit.   (b)  \nTip credit in overtime hours An\nemployer may not take a higher tip credit during overtime hours than during\nnon-overtime hours.  Under Sec. 3(m), the amount of the tip credit is the\ndifference between the direct wage paid (which cannot be less than $2.13 per\nhour) and the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.  This formula determines the maximum\namount of an employee’s tips that can be considered wages per hour during the\nworkweek.  The amount of the tip credit may not increase during the workweek,\neven during overtime hours. (c)  \nOvertime Obligation   FLSA\novertime principles apply to tipped employees in the same manner as they apply\nto all covered, non-exempt employees.   (d)  \nDetermining the Regular Rate\nfor Tipped Employees   The\nregular rate for a tipped employee is determined by dividing the total\nremuneration in any workweek, minus statutory exclusions, by the total hours\nworked. 29 CFR 531.60.  The regular rate can never be less than the highest\napplicable minimum wage.  29 CFR 778.5. An\nemployer may claim a tip credit and also provide board, lodging, or other\nfacilities. See 29 CFR part 531; FOH30c.  The tip credit equals the difference\nbetween the minimum wage and the direct wage paid, which may be comprised of\ncash, board, lodging, and/or facilities, and must be at least $2.13 per hour. \nFOH30d06(b).  In determining the regular rate for a tipped employee, all\ncomponents of the employee’s wages must be considered (cash, board, lodging,\nfacilities, tip credit). Tips in excess of the FLSA tip credit are not\nconsidered wages under Sec. 3(m) and are not considered in determining the\nregular rate.  29 CFR 531.60. In\ndetermining the regular rate for a tipped employee, both the direct wage and\nthe tip credit must be included.  For example, if the employee is paid a direct\nwage of $2.13 and the employer claims a tip credit of $5.12, the regular rate\nwill be $7.25 and the overtime rate will be $10.88 ($7.25 x 1.5).  The direct\nwage payment in overtime hours would be $5.76 ($10.88 - $5.12); the overtime\ndirect wage payment is not 1.5 x the non-overtime direct wage payment. Examples: (1)  An employee works 50 hours in a tipped occupation. \nThe employer pays a cash wage of $2.13 per hour and claims a tip credit of\n$5.12.  The employer complies with the requirements in 29 CFR 531.59(b) to\ninform its employees about the tip credit and the employee receives at least\n$5.12 per hour in tips. $7.25\nregular rate ($2.13 cash wage + $5.12 tip credit)50 x\n7.25 = 362.50 (straight time)10 x\n.5 x 7.25 = 36.25 (overtime premium)$398.75\ntotal wages due50 x\n5.12 = 256 tip credit398.75\n– 256 = 142.75 direct wage (2)  An employee works 45 hours in a tipped occupation. \nThe employer pays a cash wage of $3.00 per hour and claims a tip credit of\n$4.25.  The employer complies with the requirements in 29 CFR 531.59(b) to\ninform its employees about the tip credit and the employee receives at least\n$4.25 per hour in tips. $7.25\nregular rate ($3.00 cash wage + $4.25 tip credit)45 x\n7.25 = 326.25 (straight time)5 x\n.5 x 7.25 = 18.13 (overtime premium)$\n344.38 total wages due45 x\n4.25 = 191.25 tip credit344.38\n– 191.25 = $153.13 direct or cash wage (e)  \nDeductions  When\nan employer claims a tip credit, the tipped employee is considered to have been\npaid only the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage for all non-overtime hours worked in a\ntipped occupation.  See FOH 30d06.  An employer that claims a tip credit\ntherefore may not make deductions in a workweek of 40 hours or less for\nnon-3(m) costs such as shortages, breakage, cost of uniforms, etc., because any\nsuch deduction would reduce the tipped employee’s wages below the minimum\nwage.  Updating Regulations Issued Under the Fair Labor Standards Act; Final\nRule, 76 FR 18839, April 5, 2011; 29 CFR 531.36.  Because non-3(m) deductions\ncannot be made in a workweek of 40 hours or less when the tip credit is\nclaimed, employers are also prohibited from taking such deductions in overtime\nweeks, even when the regular rate is higher than the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage\n(for example, when a higher state minimum wage is the regular rate).  See 29\nCFR 531.37.  When an employer claims a tip credit, deductions for non-3(m)\nitems, therefore, cannot be valid in an overtime workweek, because deductions\nnot permitted in non-overtime workweeks are also prohibited in overtime\nworkweeks.  See 32j08(b). An\nemployer may only make non-3(m) deductions from the wages of a tipped employee\nwhen no tip credit is claimed and the direct or cash wage paid is greater than\nthe Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.   (f)  \nRegular Rate in Excess of FLSA\nMW When\nFederal, state or local laws require an employer to pay a higher minimum wage\nthan required by FLSA, or if the wage set through established practice,\nagreement, or understanding is greater than the  Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage, FLSA\novertime provisions require that the employee receive the regular rate for all\nhours worked before overtime is calculated.  Where an employer claims a tip\ncredit under Sec. 3(m), straight time wages paid to the employee are capped at\nthe Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.  See FOH30d00. Consequently, where the regular\nrate exceeds the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage, before additional half time for\novertime is computed, the rate paid to the tipped employee in overtime weeks\nmust be raised to the regular rate.  The employer therefore owes the difference\nbetween the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage and the regular rate in cash for all\nhours worked as a tipped employee.   (g)  \nQuestions regarding the proper\ncalculation of overtime pay often arise in situations where state or local laws\nrequire an employer to pay a higher minimum wage than required by the FLSA and\npermit the employer to claim a higher tip credit than permitted under the\nFLSA.   For\nexample, assume the state minimum wage is $7.50 and that the state law requires\na cash wage of $2.13 per hour and allows the employer to take a tip credit of\n$5.37 per hour.  Assuming all hours worked during the week were at the state\nminimum wage rate, the employee’s regular rate is the state minimum wage rate\n($7.50) but the employer is limited to a tip credit of $5.12 under the FLSA\n($7.25 – $2.13). See 29 CFR 778.5.  The employer must make up the difference\nbetween the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage and the regular rate in cash before\ncalculating the additional half time due.  See FOH32j02. (h)  Examples of how to compute overtime for tipped\nemployees For\npurposes of these examples, assume the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage rate is $7.25\nper hour, that the employee worked 45 hours in the workweek, and that all hours\nworked were in a tipped occupation.  Assume the employee meets the Sec. 3(t)\ndefinition of a tipped employee and that the employer complied with the\nrequirements in 29 CFR 531.59(b) to inform employees about the tip credit and\nthat the payroll records are accurate. (1)  The state minimum wage is $7.40 per hour, the employer\npays a cash wage of $2.89 as required under state law and claims a tip credit\nof $4.51.  The employee’s regular rate is $7.40 per hour.   \n\n\n \n  \n  State Tip Credit Provision\n  \n  \n  FLSA Tip Credit Provision\n  \n \n \n  \n  $7.40 (Regular Rate)\n  \n  \n  $7.25 (FLSA MW)\n  \n \n \n  \n  $2.89 (Cash Wage)\n  \n  \n  $2.89 (Cash Wage)\n  \n \n \n  \n  $4.51 (State Tip Credit)\n  \n  \n  $4.36 (FLSA Tip Credit)\n  \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n  \n  Wages Owed:\n  \n  \n  Straight Time\n  \n  \n  45 hours x $7.40 = $333.00\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  OT Premium\n  \n  \n  5 hours x .5 x $7.40 =\n  $18.50\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  Total Wages Due\n  \n  \n  $351.50\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  45 hours x FLSA tip credit\n  of $4.36 = $196.20 \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  $351.50 total wages due -\n  $196.20 FLSA tip credit = $155.30 (direct or cash wage)    \n  \n \n\n\n      (2)  The state minimum wage is $8.15 per hour.  The\nemployer pays a cash wage of $3.95 per hour as required under state law and\nclaims a tip credit of $4.20 per hour.  The employee’s regular rate is $8.15\nper hour.    \n\n\n \n  \n  State Tip Credit Provision\n  \n  \n  FLSA Tip Credit Provision\n  \n \n \n  \n  $8.15 (Regular Rate)\n  \n  \n  $7.25 (FLSA MW)\n  \n \n \n  \n  $3.95 (Cash Wage)\n  \n  \n  $3.95 (Cash Wage)\n  \n \n \n  \n  $4.20 (State Tip Credit)\n  \n  \n  $3.30 (FLSA Tip Credit)\n  \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n  \n  Wages Owed:\n  \n  \n  Straight Time\n  \n  \n  45 hours x $8.15 = $366.75\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  OT Premium\n  \n  \n  5 hours x .5 x $8.15 =\n  $20.38\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  Total Wages Due\n  \n  \n  $387.13\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  45 hours x FLSA tip credit\n  of $3.30 = $148.50 \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  $387.13 total wages due -\n  $148.50 FLSA tip credit = $238.63 (direct or cash wage)    \n  \n \n\n\n (3)  The state minimum wage is $7.50 per hour.  The\nemployer pays a cash wage of $2.13 per hour and claims a tip credit of $5.37\nper hour as permitted under state law.  The employee’s regular rate is $7.50\nper hour.    \n\n\n \n  \n  State Tip Credit Provision\n  \n  \n  FLSA Tip Credit Provision\n  \n \n \n  \n  $7.50 (Regular Rate)\n  \n  \n  $7.25 (FLSA MW)\n  \n \n \n  \n  $2.13 (Cash Wage)\n  \n  \n  $2.13 (Cash Wage)\n  \n \n \n  \n  $5.37 (State Tip Credit)\n  \n  \n  $5.12 (FLSA Tip Credit)\n  \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n  \n  Wages Owed:\n  \n  \n  Straight Time\n  \n  \n  45 hours x $7.50 = $337.50\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  OT Premium\n  \n  \n  5 hours x .5 x $7.50 =\n  $337.50\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  Total Wages Due\n  \n  \n  $356.25\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  45 hours x FLSA tip credit\n  of $5.12 = $230.40 \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  $356.25 total wages due -\n  $230.40 FLSA tip credit = $125.85 (direct or cash wage)    \n  \n \n\n\n (i)   \nDual Occupations  Where\nan employee works in both a tipped occupation and a non-tipped occupation in\nthe same workweek, a weighted average will generally be used to calculate the\nregular rate (blended rate).  29 C.F.R. § 778.115.  Under a blended rate, the\nearnings from the hourly rates for both occupations are added together and the\nsum is divided by the total number of hours worked at both jobs.  The\nemployee’s earnings are the total of all straight time pay plus overtime for\nhours worked in excess of 40 based on one-half times the blended rate. See\n29 CFR 778.419 and FOH 32h00 for guidance on overtime pay based on the rate in\neffect Example: An\nemployee works as a server for 32 hours and as a cook for 22 hours for the same\nemployer in the same workweek.  The employer pays $9.75 per hour for hours\nworked as a cook, which is a non-tipped occupation.  The employer paid a direct\nwage of $2.13 and claimed a tip credit of $5.12 for the hours worked as a\nserver;
