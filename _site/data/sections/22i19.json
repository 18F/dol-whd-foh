  "text": "An\nIT Support Specialist (renamed from Help Desk Support Specialist) who is\nresponsible for the diagnosis of computer-related problems, conducts problem\nanalysis and research, troubleshoots, resolves complex problems either in\nperson or by using remote control software, and ensures timely closeout of\ntrouble tickets is not exempt as an administrative or professional employee. The\nIT Support Specialist position required a high school diploma or GED, although\nan associate degree was preferred.   WHD\nhas found that an IT Support Specialist who spent time on such duties as\ndescribed below was not exempt under either the administrative or computer\nprofessional categories: Analyzes,\ntroubleshoots, and resolves complex problems with business applications,\nnetworking, and hardware.  Accurately documents all work in appropriate\nproblem tracking software.  Prioritizes tasks based on service level\nagreement criteria with limited supervision (55%). Installs,\nconfigures, and tests upgraded and new business computers and applications\nbased upon user-defined requirements.  Assists users in identifying\nhardware/software needs and provides advice regarding current options,\npolicies, and procedures.  Creates and troubleshoots network accounts and\nother business application user accounts as documented in the employee\nlifecycle process (20%). Participates\nin the design, testing, and deployment of client configurations throughout the\norganization.  This process requires detailed knowledge of Microsoft\noperating systems and compatible business applications.  Leverages\napplication packaging software technology for deployment of business applications\nto client systems (10%).  Participates\nin the analysis and selection of new technology required for expanding\ncomputing needs throughout the organization.  Works with competing vendors\nto determine the best selection based on price, technical functionality,\ndurability, manufacturer support, manufacturer vision, and position in the\nhealthcare industry (5%). Documents\ntechnical processes and troubleshooting guidelines.  Documents end-user\nfrequently asked questions about computer systems or programs and publishes on\nIntranet as guidelines for the entire organization (5%).  Monitors\nautomated alerts generated by systems management tools and makes decisions on\nthe most effective resolution (5%). Although\nthe upkeep of a computer system may be viewed as essential to an employer’s\nbusiness operations, the nature of the individual employee’s particular work,\nand not the possible results or consequences of its performance, is the focus\nof the analysis for determining if a particular employee is exempt.  To\nqualify as an exempt administrative employee, therefore, the work performed\nmust itself relate to significant matters in the management or general business\noperations of the employer.  In addition, performing highly skilled\ntechnical work in troubleshooting computer problems does not, by itself,\ndemonstrate the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to\nmatters of significance.  As stated in 29 CFR § 541.202(e), “[t]he\nexercise of discretion and independent judgment must be more than the use of\nskill in applying well-established techniques, procedures or specific standards\ndescribed in manuals or other sources.”  The\nprimary duty of the IT Support Specialist as described above consists of\ninstalling, configuring, testing, and troubleshooting computer applications,\nnetworks, and hardware.  Maintaining a computer system and testing by\nvarious systematic routines to see that a particular piece of computer\nequipment or computer application is working properly according to the\nspecifications designed by others are examples of work that lacks the requisite\nexercise of discretion and independent judgment within the meaning of the\nadministrative exemption.  Employees performing such activities are using\nskills and procedures or techniques acquired by special training or\nexperience.  Their duties do not involve, with respect to matters of\nsignificance, the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct,\nand acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been\nconsidered as required by 29 CFR § 541.202(a).  Such work does not\ninvolve formulating management policies or operating practices, committing the\nemployer in matters that have significant financial impact, negotiating and\nbinding the company on significant matters, planning business objectives, or\nother indicators of exercising discretion and independent judgment with respect\nto matters of significance discussed in 29 CFR § 541.202(b). \nAlthough minor aspects of the work (described as five to ten percent) include\nparticipating in the design of client configurations and analyzing and\nselecting new technology, the description of the tasks performed and the\ndecisions made by an IT Support Specialist does not demonstrate that their\nprimary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with\nrespect to matters of significance to the management or general business\noperations of the employer.  Therefore, the IT Support Specialist position\ndoes not qualify for the administrative exemption under section 13(a)(1) of the\nFLSA.  With\nrespect to the Computer Employee Exemption, the following analysis applies: The\nprimary duty of the IT Support Specialist consists of installing, configuring,\ntesting, and troubleshooting computer applications, networks, and\nhardware.  The primary duty of this employee does not involve the\n“application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting\nwith users, to determine hardware, software or system functional\nspecifications.”  29 CFR § 541.400(b)(1).  Nor is the primary\nduty of the IT Support Specialist “[t]he design, development, documentation,\nanalysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs,\nincluding prototypes, based on and related to user or system design\nspecifications,” see 29 CFR § 541.400(b)(2), “[t]he design, documentation,\ntesting, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating\nsystems,” 29 CFR § 541.400(b)(3), or “[a] combination of these duties, the\nperformance of which requires the same level of skills,”  29 CFR\n§ 541.400(b)(4).  Because the primary duty of the IT Support\nSpecialist as described does not consist of duties similar to those discussed\nin 29 CFR § 541.400(b)(1)-(4), the IT Support Specialist position does not\nqualify for the computer professional employee exemption under FLSA sections\n13(a)(1) and 13(a)(17).  See FOH 22i00. WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2006-42",
