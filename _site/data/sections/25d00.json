This exemption was\nnot changed by the 1974 Amendments. (b)  \nEffective 5/1/74 Sec 13(b)(4)\nprovides an exemption from the OT provisions of FLSA for “any employee employed\nin the canning, pro­cessing, marketing, freezing, curing, storing, packing for\nshipment, or distributing of any kind of fish, shellfish, or other aquatic\nforms of animal or vegetable life, or any byproducts thereof and who receives\ncompensation for employment in excess of 48 hours in any workweek at a rate not\nless than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.” (c)  \nThe phrase “and who receives\ncompensation for employment in excess of 48 hours in any workweek at a rate not\nless than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed” was\nadded to the Act by the 1974 Amendments effective 5/1/74.
