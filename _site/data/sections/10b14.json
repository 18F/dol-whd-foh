  "text": "(a)           \nWhether a student training for certain paramedical occupations is\nviewed as an employee of a hospital within the meaning of the Act will depend\nupon all the circumstances of the student’s activities on the premises of the\nestablishment. Where a bona fide student training program exists for such\nparamedical occupations, and such program meets the criteria in Sec 10b11, no\nemployment relationship will be deemed to exist. Generally this involves\nstudents training for such occupations as registered nurse, licensed vocational\nor practical nurse, x-ray technician, certified laboratory assistant, or any\nother skilled paramedical position. Such programs involve on-the-job training\ncombined with extensive classroom lectures and laboratory instruction generally\nresulting in students receiving degrees, licensing, registration, or\ncertification by an appropriate board or society. The mere payment of a\nscholarship, stipend, or allowance (as long as it does not exceed a reasonable\napproximation of the expenses incurred by the trainee taking the course or\nwhere it serves as an allowance for subsistence) will not be considered to\nestablish an employment relationship. (b)           \nSituations may be encountered where such a student will work in\nthe hospital for compensation outside of the training schedule. In the typical\ncase a student may do office or switchboard work. In such cases the student\nwill be considered an employee during the time spent on such work and must be\npaid in compliance with the Act’s requirements for such time. However, the fact\nthat the student would be considered an employee during such time would not\nrequire the time spent in activities described in (a) above to be counted as\nhours worked. (c)           \nOn the other hand, the principles in (a) above do not include\ncertain training programs such as those conducted for nurses aides and\norderlies where much of the training consists of on-the-job training and work\nexperience with little if any related classroom lectures or laboratory\ninstructions and which ordinarily do not lead to licensing, registration or\ncertification. In many cases these programs exist only for the purpose of\nfilling existing vacancies on the hospital staff. In such cases the students\nwould be considered employees of the hospital. In this regard any time spent in\nthe classroom or attending lectures would not be considered hours worked.",
