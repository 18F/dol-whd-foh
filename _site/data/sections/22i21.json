For example, in law enforcement organizations,\ninvestigation activities are among the primary functions of the “business.” \nTherefore, investigations are more related to the day-to-day operations than to\nthe management or general business operations.  Such\nemployees also do not typically qualify for the administrative exemption\nbecause their work involves the use of skills and technical abilities in\ngathering factual information, applying known standards or prescribed\nprocedures, determining which procedure to follow, or determining whether\nprescribed standards or criteria are met. Thus, the primary duty does not\ntypically include the exercise of discretion or independent judgment with\nrespect to matters of significance to the management or general business\noperations of the employer. Public\nsector investigators whose primary duty is management may qualify for the\nexecutive exemption, provided that the other tests of the exemption are met.
