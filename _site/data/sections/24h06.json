  "text": "(a)   Old Sec 13(a)(12), prior to 2/l/67,\nprovided a MW and OT exemption for “any employee of an employer engaged in the\nbusiness of operating taxicabs”. Since the old Sec 13(a)(12) exemption extended\nto all employees whose work is performed in connection with the employer’s\ntaxicab business, it would include drivers, dispatchers, office workers,\nmechanics, etc. Employment which became subject to the MW provisions by virtue\nof the repeal of old Sec 13(a)(12) is subject to the Sec 6(b) rate. (b)   Tolerance for nonexempt work. Nonexempt\nwork, for purposes of old Sec 13(a)(12), is work which is not normally\nconsidered a part of the taxicab business . However, for enforcement purposes,\nthe exemption shall be deemed applicable even though some nonexempt work is per­formed\nby a particular employee during the w/w, unless the amount of such nonexempt\nwork is substantial. The amount of nonexempt work will be considered\nsubstantial if it occupies more than 20% of the time worked by the employee\nduring the w/w. (See IB 786, Subpart E.) Examples of nonexempt work include: (1) \nthe transfer of\nbaggage or freight which is not performed in conjunction with and as an\nincident to the transportation of persons in the same vehicle; (2) \nwork performed in\nconnection with garage and repair services on vehicles other than those used in\nthe employer’s taxicab business; or (3) \nwork performed in\nconnection with other business operations of the employer (i.e. not his taxicab\noperations) such as the operation of an airport limousine service (see FOH\n24c04), a pick-up and delivery service, or a moving and storage service.
