  "text": "(a)   It is the position of WH that the Department\nof Transportation (DOT) has no jurisdiction over the operation of ambulances\nand hearses within the meaning of the FLSA Sec 13(b)(1) motor carrier\nexemption, and that the exemption does not apply to employees so engaged. This\nposition is derived from court and administrative decisions and a statement by\nDOT disclaiming jurisdiction over ambulances. Spires v. Ben Hill County, 980\nF.2d 683 (11th Cir. 1993); Jones v. Giles, 741 F.2d 245 (9th Cir. 1984); Lonnie\nW. Dennis. Common Carrier Application 63 M.C.C. 66 (1954); 42 Federal Register\n60,078, 60,080 (November 23, 1977). (b)   The Eleventh Circuit (Spires) recently\njoined the Ninth Circuit (Jones) in holding that ambulance drivers are not\nsubject to FLSA Sec 13(b)(l). Both courts noted that the Interstate Commerce\nCommission (ICC) (DOT predecessor) had determined that the unique operation of\nambulances compared to other forms of motor transportation put them outside the\nICC’s jurisdiction. The only decision specifically contrary is Benson v.\nUniversal Ambulance Service. Inc., 675 F.2d 783 (6th Cir. 1982), a decision\nwhich did not deal with the ICC ruling, and both the Ninth and Eleventh\nCircuits specifically declined to follow Benson. (See also FOH 52p07.)",
