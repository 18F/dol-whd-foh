  "text": "(a)   As Sec 13(d) is a CL exemption as\nwell as an MW and OT exemption, there can be no tolerance for nonexempt work.\nIf any of the work performed by the minor is not exempt under the section, the\nexemption does not apply. (b)  However, if the minors are 14 and 15\nyears old, their employment may be permissible even though the Sec 13(d)\nexemption is defeated by the performance of nonexempt work. For example, if the\nduties of the minors consist wholly of exempt work and nonexempt work which is\npermitted by CL Reg 3, their employment would be permissible provided it\ncomplies with the conditions of that Reg. One of the conditions is that the\nwork must not be performed so as to be a part of the manufacturing process and\nmust not be performed in any manufacturing or processing room or work place.",
