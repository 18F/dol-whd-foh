  "text": "(a)   General WDs contain no expiration date. Once issued,\nthey remain valid until modified, superseded, or canceled. They may be used by\nthe contracting agency, without prior notification to DOL, in contracts to be\nperformed within the specified geographical area and for the types of\nconstruction designated in the WD. (b)  Project WDs are effective for 180 calendar days from\nthe date they are issued. If the contract for which a project WD is requested\nis not awarded within the 180 days before the WD expires, the contracting\nagency must request a new WD or obtain an extension of the expiration date from\nthe Administrator. A project WD is applicable only to the particular project\nfor which it was initially requested; it may not be included by the contracting\nagency in any other construction contracts. (c)   Modifications to general and project WDs, notice of\nwhich are published in web site http://www.wdol.gov or received by the\ncontracting agency less than 10 days before bid opening, but not after bid\nopening, are effective unless the agency finds there is not sufficient time to\nnotify bidders of the change. (See 29 CFR § 1.6(c).) (d)  In addition, 29 CFR § 1.6(c)(3)(iv) provides that if a\ncontract to which a general WD has been applied is not awarded within 90 days\nafter bid opening, any modification published prior to contract award is\neffective, unless the agency obtains an extension of the 90-day period from the\nAdministrator. 29 CFR § 1.6(e) provides that if a bid solicitation is found to\ncontain a wrong WD, or if a WD is withdrawn as a result of an Administrative\nReview Board decision, notification to the contracting agency of such a finding\nis effective immediately, provided notification is made prior to contract\naward. Further, 29 CFR § 1.6(f) provides a mechanism to require contracting\nagencies to utilize a WD after award if it is found that the agency failed to\ninclude any WD in a covered contract or used a WD which clearly does not apply\nto the contract. 29 CFR § 1.6(g) contains guidelines for the application of WDs\nin situations where Federal funding or assistance is not approved until after\ncontract award (or after start of construction where there is no contract\naward). (e)   Project or general WDs included in a contract are\neffective for the life of the contract. However, contracts that contain Option\nClauses by which a contracting agency may unilaterally extend the term of the\ncontract require inclusion of a current WD at the time the option is exercised.\n(AAM # 157).",
