  "text": "(a)  \n29 CFR 570.33(a) prohibits the\nemployment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing, mining, or processing\noccupations.  This section also prohibits the employment of such minors in\noccupations which require the minors to perform any duties in work rooms or\nwork places where goods are manufactured, mined, or otherwise processed.  FLSA\n§ 13(c)(7) provides an exemption from these requirements for certain youth who\nmay now be employed inside and outside of establishments where power-driven\nmachinery is used to process wood products (see FOH 33e06). (b)  \nThe definitions of manufacturing\nand processing contained in (e) and (f) below are intended for use only in\nconnection with the CL provisions of the FLSA. (c)  \nIt is necessary to distinguish\nbetween manufacturing and processing only when the parental exemption is\ninvolved (see FOH 33c00).  The parental exemption contained in the\nFLSA does not permit the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing or\nmining, but does allow the employment of this age group by a parent in\nprocessing occupations. (d)  \nAlthough CL Reg 3 generally\nprohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in processing occupations (29\nCFR 570.33(a)), youth may perform certain named processing occupations that are\ndetailed in § 570.34.   (e)  \nManufacturing defined The\nterm manufacturing means making anything from raw materials by\nhand, or by machinery, or by art.  The process of manufacturing generally\ninvolves the transformation of raw materials or semi-finished goods into new or\ndifferent articles.  The manufacturing process is not completed until the\narticle being manufactured has reached the form in which it will be available\nto the ultimate consumer.  Any occupation involved in the manufacture of a\nproduct from the assembling of the raw materials for manufacture to the\ncompletion of the manufactured article is a part of the manufacturing process,\nand, therefore, a manufacturing occupation.  All manufacturing is processing,\nbut not all processing is manufacturing.  The following are examples of\nmanufacturing within the meaning of CL Reg 3:   (1)  Trimming and examining of items when performed as a\npart of a manufacturing process. (2)  Quality control and inspection of manufactured\nproducts.   (3)  Cleaning of a printing press and proofreading in a\nprint shop.   (4)  Canning of fresh fruits or vegetables.   (5)  The assembly of component parts into a finished\nproduct away from the place where the component parts are manufactured is a\ncontinuation of the manufacturing process, and is manufacturing.   (6)  Assembling of box shook or crates in which goods are\nto be packed, including making of the lid or cover, is a change in the raw\nmaterial from which the box or crate is made and constitutes “manufacturing”\nwhether done by hand or machine.  However, assembling light-weight flat-folded\ncartons either by stapling with a hand stapler machine or by pasting with tape\nis not manufacturing.   (7)  “Lidding”—the operation of fastening down the cover on\nthe filled container—is manufacturing when it is accomplished by use of a\npower-driven machine.   (8)  Stitching of bags containing produce by means of\nautomatic electric sewing machines in fresh fruit and vegetable packing sheds\nis manufacturing.   (9)  The folding, pinning, and packaging for shipment of\nnewly manufactured apparel. (10)  “Carding.”  If the article is sold to the consumer as a\npackaged or carded article, as is often the case with jewelry or buttons, the\npackaging or carding of the article into the form in which it is offered to the\npublic is considered an integral part of the manufacturing of the article when\nthe work is performed in the manufacturing establishment. (f)  \nProcessing defined (1)  The term processing ordinarily is understood to convey\nthe idea of an operation in the course of which goods undergo a change in form\nor substance.  Examples of processing within the meaning of CL Reg 3 are:   a.    \nCleaning and filleting of fish,\nfreezing fresh shrimp, and the picking and packing of crabs. b.    \nSlaughtering of livestock.   c.    \nDressing of poultry.   d.    \nCracking of nuts.  e.    \nLaundering, folding, hanging, and\npressing clean laundry; and the altering of clothes (whether performed in\ncommercial laundries or retail dry cleaners).  Except the washing and drying of\nlaundry performed in a coin-operated laundromat with home-type washer and dryer\nmachines is not considered processing if performed in a room separated from all\nother processing.  f.     \nCutting or chipping of ice.   g.    \nAir drying or seasoning of\nlumber.   h.    \nRepairing of motor vehicles,\nchanging tires and batteries.   i.     \nPlacing of business records on\nmicrofilm.   j.     \nOperations in connection with bulk\nmailings including folding letters; addressing, stuffing, and sealing\nenvelopes; affixing postage; and bundling mailings.   k.    \nPainting of mine timbers; painting\nand embossing objects.   l.   \nDeveloping of X-rays. m.  \nDevelopment of film into\nphotographs, including the use of automated systems in retail stores. n.    \nThe cutting of “mats” for\nphotographs, engravings, and artwork whether by hand, with a power-driven tool,\nor a computerized automatic cutter.   (2)  The following activities would not be manufacturing or\nprocessing activities: a.    \nThe trimming and shearing of\nordinary household-size Christmas trees with hand tools (i.e., not power-driven\nequipment) does not constitute a “processing occupation” as the term is used in\nCL Reg 3.  Therefore, minors 14 and 15 years of age may be employed in this\noccupation in accordance with the other provisions of CL Reg 3.  In some\ninstances, occupations in connection with Christmas trees may be within the\ndefinition of agriculture contained in FLSA § 3(f) (see\nFOH 20b06); in such cases §§ 13(c)(1) and (2) apply.  b.    \nThe transfer of propane from large\npressurized tanks to smaller tanks of a lower pressure without the use of power\ndriven equipment is not considered processing.  Therefore, minors 14 and 15 years\nof age are not be prohibited from performing this activity because it is not\nconsidered processing.  The basic form of the propane gas is not altered when\nit is transferred from the large pressurized tank to the smaller pressurized\ntank.   c.    \nThe packing of fresh fruits and\nvegetables is not processing because the goods remain in their raw or natural\nstate.  Packing includes cleaning, washing, trimming, application of artificial\ncoloring, sorting, grading, tiering, wrapping, packaging and labeling packages\nwhen these operations take place in conjunction with and as a part of the\npacking of fresh fruits and vegetables.  d.    \nThe tagging and pricing of\nclothing for sale in a retail used-clothing shop, when some of the clothing is\nnot salable and is returned to a central location for processing into rags or\nsold for scrap, is not processing.  The mere sorting of clothing does not\nchange or alter the clothing.   e.    \nThe stuffing of newspapers—that is\nthe placing of one section of newspaper inside another—when performed outside\nthe work rooms in which printing, manufacturing, or processing takes place, is\na distribution function rather than a manufacturing or processing function. \nTherefore, 14- and 15-year-old minors may be employed in such newspaper\nstuffing, provided all the terms and conditions of CL Reg 3 are met.  This\napplies also to other occupations in the newspaper industry further removed\nfrom the manufacturing of the newspaper, such as bundling, tying up,\naddressing, and other mailing room occupations, and to employment in a\nwholesale house engaged in the distribution of newspapers and magazines. \nProhibited processing would occur if the minors placed newspapers in plastic\nbags and then “heat sealed” the bags for security reasons or to protect the\ncontents from the elements.",
