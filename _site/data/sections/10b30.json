  "text": "(a)        “Foster\nGrandparent” and “Senior Companion” programs. Volunteers\nparticipating in either the “Foster Grandparent” or “Senior Companion” programs\nunder the Domestic Volunteer Services Act of 1973, are not employees under the\nFLSA. (b)           \n“University Year for Action” (UYA) programs. (1)          \nSituations may be encountered where a university has established\na federally-funded “University Year for ACTION” (UYA) service learning program\npursuant to the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (DVSA). These programs\nprovide that students will receive college credits when they volunteer to\nperform various services, often for a nonprofit private organization, on a\nfull-time basis for a year. The students receive a subsistence-level stipend to\ncover their expenses, and they are required to live at the low income level of\nthe people they serve. The legislative history of the DVSA and the FLSA make\nclear that these students are not considered employees for purposes of the\nFLSA. (2)          \nUniversities which receive federal “University Year ACTION” funds\nhave a five-year funding limit, but are required to make every effort to\ncontinue the program after federal funds cease. Under such UYA continuation\nprograms, the students generally receive college credit, pay tuition, receive a\nstipend, keep a journal of their experiences, make presentations of their work\nand learning, and present periodic written reports of their progress in\nachieving the program’s objectives. In addition, the sponsor, ordinarily a\nfaculty member, evaluates their internship performance. (3)          \nWhere a UYA continuation program meets this description, WH will\nnot assert that an employment relationship exists. However, where programs are\nencountered which differ materially from the above described circumstances,\nobtain all the facts of the case and refer the file to the NO/OEP, ATTN: FLSA\nTeam.",
