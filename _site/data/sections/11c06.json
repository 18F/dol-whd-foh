  "text": "(a)   Under IB 776.26 and 776.27, the construction of a new\nfactory building or other production facility designed as a replacement,\nenlargement, extension or improvement of an existing covered production\nfacility will be individually covered. IB 776.26 points out that “Coverage of\nany construction work, whether new or repair work, depends upon how closely\nintegrated it is with, and how essential it is to the functioning of, existing\ncovered facilities. Neither the mere fact that the construction is ‘new\nconstruction’ nor the fact that it is physically separated from an existing\ncovered plant, is determinative.” Thus the fact that the new plant is located\nat a considerable distance from the existing facility will not preclude\nindividual coverage. If such coverage is present, certain preparatory\noperations would likewise be covered under the principles set fourth in IB\n776.28(a)(3). (b)   The following examples, while not intended to be\nrestrictive in any way, are illustrative of some types of construction over\nwhich individual coverage has been asserted under the position set forth in (a)\nabove: (1)  The construction of a new building in an adjacent town\nto expand the operations of an existing plant which will continue to produce\ngoods for commerce. (2)  The construction of a suburban drive-in branch for an\nexisting downtown bank. Also, the construction of a building for an existing\nbank to serve as a replacement of the bank notwithstanding that the predominant\nuse of the new structure may be devoted to uses other than banking. (3)  The construction of a new factory at a new location to\nreplace the existing plant of a firm manufacturing goods for commerce although\nthe new factory is at a substantial distance from the manufacturer’s present\nplant. (4)  The construction of a new factory outside of the city\nlimits designed specifically for the purpose of housing a garment factory now\noperating in the same town, in rented quarters. The building is being financed\nby local subscription under a State program of inducing new industries to move\ninto or remain in the state. The building when constructed will be leased to\nthe manufacturer. (c)   If the Inv can make a clear determination that the\nconstruction is individually covered because it falls within any of the four\nexamples described in (b) above, the investigation may proceed. If not, the\nfollowing facts should be developed and the case referred to the RS: (1)  Is the new plant to be coordinated in any way with\nproduction at the existing plant, and if so, how (i.e., will it be used to\nproduce the complete ultimate product, or will it be used for partial\nprocessing or assembling of products begun, finished, or otherwise processed at\nan existing plant)?  (2)  Does the new plant include features (in design,\nmaterials or equipment, or otherwise) specifically adapted to the particular\nkind of production? (3)  Will there be any transfer of employees or equipment\nfrom the existing plant to the new plant, or will there be any interchange of\nemployees between the existing and the new plant? (4)  Will there be joint management and operation of the\nnew and the existing plant, giving any available information on plans for a\njoint or segregated management and operation? (5)  Will production start at the new plant before\ncompletion of the construction, and if so, when and to what extent; or how soon\nafter completion is production at the new plant to start? (6)  Is the new plant being constructed to produce products\nfor an entirely new set of customers, or is it to meet the needs of the present\nsource of customers because their current or imminent needs have expanded\nbeyond the capacity of the existing plant? (7)  Are there outstanding any specific orders or contracts\nwhich the new plant will be used to fill?",
