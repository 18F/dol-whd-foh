  "text": "Name: \nOccupations of Motor-vehicle Driver and Outside HelperOriginally Adopted:  January 1, 1940 (a)  \nScope of HO 2  (1)  Driving a motor vehicle involves a high degree of\naccident risk for persons of all ages, and is particularly hazardous for minors\nbetween the ages of 16 and 18 due to their lack of experience.  Despite the\nprohibitions of HO 2, transportation-related deaths, largely\nhighway incidents, remained the most frequently recorded cause of occupational\ndeaths of 16- and 17-year-olds between 1980 and 2007.  HO 2 applies to all\nemployers subject to the nonagricultural CL provisions of the FLSA and, with a\nlimited statutory exception, specifically prohibits the employment of persons\nunder the age of 18 as motor-vehicle operators and as “outside helpers” on any\npublic road, highway and in or about any mine (including open pit mine or\nquarry), place where logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any\nexcavation covered by HO 17.  However, driving on private property (other than\ndescribed above) is permitted.  These provisions apply whether the employee is\ndriving a personal or business owned-vehicle. (2)  The Drive for Teen Employment Act, effective October\n31, 1998, amended the FLSA by creating § 13(c)(6) and established the\nconditions under which 17-year-olds (but not those under 17 years of age) may\ndrive certain automobiles and trucks on the job.   (3)  Definitions a.    \nThe\nterm motor vehicle shall mean any automobile, truck, truck-tractor, trailer,\nsemi-trailer, motorcycle, or similar vehicle propelled or drawn by mechanical\npower and designed for use as a means of transportation but shall not include\nany vehicle operated exclusively on rails. 1.    \nThe\nabove definition is not dependent upon the source of energy – vehicles may be\npropelled by gasoline, propane, electricity, etc. 2.    \nThis\ndefinition does not require that the motor vehicle be licensed or outfitted\nwith special equipment, nor is the size of the vehicle a factor.  Golf carts,\nall terrain vehicles (ATVs), and riding mowers designed or used as a means of\ntransportation, meet the definition of “motor vehicles” and fall within the\nscope of HO 2 when operated on any public road or highway (see 75 FR 28409).  3.    \nThe\nterm “similar vehicle” includes buses, vans, mopeds, pickup trucks, panel\ntrucks, recreational vehicles, ice-cream and chuck-wagon-type trucks, motorized\ntrail bikes, jeeps, and other all terrain vehicles. b.    \nThe\nterm driver shall mean any individual who, in the course of employment, drives\na motor vehicle at any time.  c.    \nThe\nterm outside helper shall mean any individual, other than a driver, whose work\nincludes riding on a motor vehicle outside the cab for the purpose of assisting\nin transporting or delivering goods. d.    \nThe\nterm gross vehicle weight includes the truck chassis with lubricants, water and\na full tank or tanks of fuel, plus the weight of the cab or driver’s\ncompartment, body and special chassis and body equipment, and payload. e.    \nThe\nterm occasional and incidental driving is now defined in the FLSA as driving\nthat involves no more than one-third of the worktime in any work day and no\nmore than 20 percent of the worktime in any workweek. f.     \nThe\nterm urgent, time-sensitive deliveries means trips which, because of such\nfactors as customer satisfaction, the rapid deterioration of the quality or\nchange in temperature of the product, and/or economic incentives, are subject\nto time-lines, schedules, and/or turn around times which might impel the driver\nto hurry in the completion of the delivery.  Prohibited trips would include,\nbut are not limited to, the delivery of pizzas and prepared foods to the\ncustomers; the delivery of materials under a deadline (such as deposits to a\nbank at closing, or parts to a job site for the completion of an emergency\nrepair job); and the shuttling of passengers to and from transportation depots to\nmeet transport schedules.  Urgent, time sensitive deliveries do not depend on\nthe delivery’s points of origin and termination, and include the delivery of\npeople and things to the employer’s place of business as well as from that\nbusiness to some other location. g.    \nTo\ndefine the term public road, WHD uses the generally accepted definition of a\npublic road as “a road or way established and adopted (or accepted as a\ndedication) by the proper authorities for the use of the general public, and\nover which every person has a right to pass and to use it for all purposes of\ntravel or transportation to which it is adapted and devoted.  The proper test\nin determining whether [a] road is a ‘public’ or ‘private road’ is [the] use to\nwhich such roadway is put, and [the] fact that [the] road has been constructed\nat public expense is not conclusive” (Bush & Burchett, Inc. v. Reich, 117\nF.3d 932, 938 n. 11 (6th Cir. 1997), citing Black's Law Dictionary\n1329 (6th ed. 1990)).  Under this standard, a pathway or road in or\nat the perimeter of a City park would not be considered a public road, if it is\nused only by pedestrians, bicyclists, golf carts, and similar traffic to access\nparts of the park grounds for recreational purposes.  But if the pathway or\nroad is used by automobiles or trucks to traverse the park or to access park\nfacilities for purposes such as delivery of goods, then it would be considered\na public road. (b)   Occupations PROHIBITED (1)  Driving any type of motor vehicle on public roads or\nhighways and in or about any mine (including open pit mine or quarry), place\nwhere logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any excavation\ncovered by HO 17, except as authorized by § 13(c)(6). (2)  Riding outside the cab of a vehicle as an outside\nhelper. (3)  Towing of any vehicles.  (c)  \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED (1)  Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may operate motor vehicles\non private property other than any mine (including open pit mine or quarry),\nplace where logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any excavation\ncovered by HO 17. (2)  Other motorized vehicles to which HO 2 does not apply a.    \nHO 2\ndoes not apply to self-propelled vehicles that are designed to perform work as\ndistinguished from being used “as a means of transportation.”  This includes\ncertain types of riding mowers, farm tractors, bulldozers, road scrapers, and\nother vehicles not suitable for travel on public streets, geared only for\noff-the-road use, and only designed for use on construction sites, grassy areas\nand along walk paths.  When it is necessary to move such vehicles any distance,\nthey are generally loaded on a lowboy-type flatbed trailer and transported from\njob site to job site.  Some of these vehicles, however, may be prohibited under\nHO 17 when used in excavation.  Note:  See “Enforcement positions”\n(FOH 33h02(e)(3)) regarding riding mowers and golf carts that must cross\npublic roads to complete a work assignment. b.    \nTrucks\nthat have equipment permanently mounted on them (such as mobile drilling rigs)\nor equipment that has its own built-in means of transport are considered motor\nvehicles under HO 2 and fall under the prohibitions of the HO when\noperated on public roads.  Some of these trucks and pieces of equipment can\ntravel at speeds in excess of 30 miles per hour.   c.    \nCertain\nelectric carts are used as a means of transportation in large industrial\nplants, and at railroad stations and airport terminals.  Generally, such\nvehicles are outside the scope of HO 2 unless employees use these vehicles as a\nmeans of transportation on a public street.  Thus, 16- and 17-year-old minors\nmay operate motorized vehicles such as riding mowers or golf carts as long as\nthey are not driven on public roads. (d)   Exemptions (1)  HO 2 does not contain an\nexemption for apprentices or student-learners.  Furthermore, none of the\nlimited exemptions applicable to HOs 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17 permit\napprentices or student-learners to drive motor-vehicles as part of their\ntraining programs. (2)  Occasional and\nincidental driving by 17-year-olds.  The Drive for Teen Employment Act, enacted\non October 31, 1998, amended the FLSA to permit 17-year-olds (but not those\nunder 17 years of age) to drive automobiles and trucks as part of their\nemployment if all of the following criteria are met: a.     The automobile or truck does\nnot exceed 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, b.     The driving is\nrestricted to daylight hours, c.     The minor holds a state\nlicense valid for the type of driving involved in the job performed, d.     The minor has\nsuccessfully completed a state approved driver education course, e.     The minor has no records\nof any moving violation at the time of hire, f.      The vehicle is equipped\nwith a seat belt for the driver and any passengers and the employer has\ninstructed the youth that the seat belts must be used when driving the vehicle, g.     The driving does not\ninvolve: 1.     Towing\nvehicles,2.     Route\ndeliveries or route sales,3.     Transportation\nfor hire of property, goods, or passengers,4.     Urgent,\ntime sensitive-deliveries,5.     Transporting more than 3\npassengers, including employees of the employer, 6.     Driving beyond a 30 mile\nradius from the minor’s place of employment, 7.     More than two trips away\nfrom the primary place of employment in any single day to deliver the\nemployer’s goods to a customer (other than urgent, time-sensitive deliveries\nwhich are prohibited), or 8.     More than two trips away\nfrom the primary place of employment in any single day to transport passengers,\nother than employees of the employer, and h.     Such driving is only\noccasional and incidental to the minor’s employment.  This means that the youth\nmay spend no more than one-third of the worktime in any workday and no more\nthan 20 percent of the worktime in any workweek driving. (e)   Enforcement positions (1)  Ambulance attendants Minors 16 and 17 years of age who have completed\nthe necessary training as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and are employed\nas qualified ambulance attendants are not “outside helpers” within the meaning\nof HO 2 and may ride in the rear of the ambulance while attending the patient\nbeing transported. (2)  Cart caddy The operation of battery operated “cart caddy”\nmachines used by grocery stores to move large strings of shopping carts back to\nthe front area of the store would be a permissible occupation for minors 16 and\n17 years of age.  This machine is not considered a “motor vehicle” and does not\nfall within the scope of HO 2.  However, as it is a power-driven machine, its\nuse by 14- and 15-year-olds is prohibited under CL Reg 3. (3)  Golf carts and riding\nmowers a.     Golf carts, riding\nmowers, and similar motorized vehicles fall within the scope of HO 2 if used as\na means of transportation on public roads.  Because these motorized vehicles\nare not “automobiles or trucks, operation of such vehicles would not fall under\nthe limited exemption contained in FLSA § 13(c)(6). b.     There are certain\nsituations where a public road traverses a golf course or other establishments\nwhere motorized vehicles are used off the roadway.  It may be necessary for\ngolf carts, riding mowers, or other motorized vehicles to cross the public road\nin order to reach a particular work site or return to the club house.  Although\na strict interpretation of HO 2 would prohibit those under 18 years of age from\ndriving the carts and mowers across public roads, WH will not assert a\nviolation of HO 2 if the contact with the public road involves only the\ncrossing of that road, and such crossings occur only at marked cross walks and\npathways. (4)  Messengers  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may, under certain\nconditions, be employed as messengers and errand boys/girls by firms other than\npublic messenger services to pick up and deliver messages or packages in\npassenger type vehicles operated by someone other than the minor (see\nFOH 33c(19)(b), see also § 570.34(o)).",
