  "text": "Migrant agricultural worker temporary housing inspections\nnormally will be conducted under MSPA, (see FOH Chapter 36) or the H-2A program\nrequirements pertaining to housing (see FOH Chapter 38). It is recommended that\nthe WHI first determine whether or not temporary labor camp housing standards\ncan be enforced under MSPA or H-2A.  Generally, enforcement of the temporary\nlabor camp standards (i.e., 29 CFR 1910.142) should be carried out under the\nMSPA statutory authority or H-2A program of the INA if the employer is subject\nto those requirements.  However, if the employer housing is located within a\nState for which WHD has jurisdiction under the OSHAct and it is uncertain\nwhether or not MSPA coverage applies or if the provider of the housing can\nclaim a MSPA exemption - or if the violations involve risks to health and\nsafety that warrant the application of the remedies available under OSHAct, the\ninvestigation shall be conducted under WHD’s OSHAct authority.  It is not\nappropriate to cite and sanction violations under different Acts for the same\nviolation(s). Note that S/O 5-96 specifies that WHD temporary labor\ncamp enforcement under the OSHAct is  limited to those agricultural\nestablishments where employees are engaged in “agricultural employment” as\ndefined by MSPA at 29 USC 1802(3) (See also 29 CFR 500.20(e)), regardless of\nthe number of employees, including employees engaged in hand packing of produce\ninto containers, whether done on the ground, on a moving machine, or in a\ntemporary packing shed, except OSHA retains jurisdiction over agricultural temporary\nlabor camps for employees engaged in egg, poultry, or red meat production, or\npost-harvest processing of agricultural or horticultural commodities.  Again,\nWHD authority under the OSHAct is not limited to whether the workers are\nmigrant or seasonal agricultural workers as those terms are defined under the\nMSPA – but whether the work being performed by the workers constitutes\n“agricultural employment” as that term is defined under MSPA. 29 CFR 500.132; 29 USC 1802; 26 USC 3121(g)",
