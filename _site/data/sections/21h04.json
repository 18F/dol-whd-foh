  "text": "(a)   Some retail or service establishments compute an\nemployee’s compensation on the basis of percentage of the charge to the\ncustomer, such as the charge for labor or the charge for service and parts used\nin repair. Compensation computed in this manner “represents commissions on\ngoods or services” for purposes of applying Sec 7(i). Employees whose\ncompensation (either in whole or in part) is frequently computed in this\nfashion are barbers, beauty shop operators, household appliance repairmen, and\nautomobile mechanics. (b)  Some auto service garages compensate mechanics or\npainters on the basis of commissions which are based on a percentage of the\nestimated labor charges to recondition used cars which are subsequently sold.\nSuch payments “represent commissions on goods or services” for purposes of sec\n7(i). The term “commissions or services” includes commissions measured by value\nas well as by sale of services and the value of such services is ultimately\nreflected in the price of the used cars worked on. (c)   Some auto service garages pay employees a flat fee to\nrecondition used cars which are subsequently sold. Such payments which are paid\nwithout regard to the value of the service performed do not represent\n“commissions on goods or services” for purposes of Sec 7(i). Such employees are\nconsidered to be compensated on a piece rate basis and not on the basis of\ncommissions. Commissions, for purposes of Sec 7(i), usually denotes a\npercentage of the amount of monies paid out or received (see (b) above).\n(However, see (d) below.) (d)  Some auto service garages and car dealerships\ncompensate mechanics and painters on the following basis: The painter or\nmechanic gets so much a “flat rate” hour for the work he or she performs. A\n“flat rate” hour is not an actual clock hour. The painter or mechanic may work\nonly 7, 8 or 9 hours a day and still receive credit for 10, 11 or 12, etc.,\nflat rate hours depending upon how much work he or she has done. Each job is assigned\na certain number of hours for which the customer is charged, regardless of the\nactual time it takes to perform the job. The employee is given a certain\nproportion of that charge expressed in terms of so many dollars and cents per\n“flat rate” hour rather than in terms of a percentage of the charge to the\ncustomer. The dealer does not change the employee’s share per flat rate hour if\nthe charge to the customer is changed. In such situations Wage-Hour will not\ndeny that such payments represent “commissions on goods or services” for\npurposes of Sec 7(i) (see IB 778.117 and 779.413(b)). Such employment will\nqualify for exemption under Sec 7(i) provided all the other tests of the\nexemption are met.",
