  "text": "(a)   Limited\nexceptions provide for an employer to deny job restoration to an employee when: (1)  The employment\nrelationship ended and would have even if the employee had been continuously\nworking, (2)  A key\nemployee’s reinstatement would cause substantial and grievous economic injury\nto the employer, see FOH 39j06(g), (3)  The employee is\nunable to perform an essential function of his or her job because of a physical\nor mental condition, or (4)  The employee\nfraudulently obtained FMLA leave. 29 CFR 825.216(a) and (b) (b)   If an employee\nchooses not to or is unable to return to work after exhausting his or her FMLA\nleave, all entitlements and rights under the FMLA cease at that time.  The\nemployee is no longer entitled to any further job restoration rights under the FMLA\nand may be terminated. WHD Non-Administrator\nLetter FMLA-91 December 9, 1997 (c)   No\ngreater right An employee on FMLA\nleave maintains the same rights he or she would have if the employee had\ncontinued to work instead of taking FMLA leave.  This applies to reinstatement\nand other benefits and conditions of employment.  An employer must be able to\nshow that an employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time for\nreinstatement in order to deny restoration. For example, an\nemployee is not entitled to restoration at the end of 12 workweeks if the\nemployee is laid off during the leave, the employee’s shift has been\neliminated, or the term or project for which the employee was hired has ended. \nAn employer would have the burden of proving the employee would have been laid\noff, the shift would have been eliminated, or the term or project for which the\nemployee was hired would have ended during the leave period. 29 CFR 825.216(a) (d)   Unable to\nperform an essential function If an employee\nreturning from FMLA leave is unable to perform an essential function of the\nposition, the employee has no right to restoration to another position under\nthe FMLA and the FMLA does not require the employer to create a position that\ndid not previously exist.  However, the employer may have obligations under the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA), State or other laws governing\nrestoration. 29 CFR\n825.216(c)WHD Non-Administrator\nLetter FMLA-47 October 17, 1994 (e)   Outside\nemployment The FMLA does not\nprohibit an employee from working at a second job while on FMLA leave unless\nthe employer has a uniformly applied policy against outside or supplemental\nemployment.  An employer which does not have such a policy may not deny\nbenefits to which an employee is entitled under the FMLA on this basis unless\nthe FMLA leave was fraudulently obtained. 29 CFR 825.216(e)WHD Non-Administrator\nLetter FMLA-106 July 1, 1999 (f)   Fraudulent\nFMLA usage An employee who\nfraudulently obtains leave under the FMLA is not protected by the FMLA’s job\nrestoration or maintenance of health benefits provisions. 29 CFR 825.216(d) (g)   Key\nemployee (1)  An employer may\ndeny job restoration to a key employee if the denial is necessary to prevent\nsubstantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer. a.     Definition\nand determination A key employee is a\nsalaried FMLA-eligible employee who is among the highest paid 10 percent of all\nemployees employed by the employer within 75 miles of the employee’s worksite. \nThe determination of whether a salaried employee is among the highest paid 10\npercent is made at the time the employee gives notice of the need for leave. b.     Substantial\nand grievous economic injury1.     In\norder to deny restoration to a key employee, the employer must determine that\nthe employee’s restoration, not his or her absence, will cause “substantial and\ngrievous economic injury.” 2.     There\nis no precise test for determining the level of hardship or injury the employer\nmust sustain.  If the reinstatement of a key employee threatens the economic\nviability of the firm, that would constitute substantial and grievous economic\ninjury.  A lesser injury which causes substantial, long-term economic injury\nwould also be sufficient.  Minor inconveniences and costs that the employer\nwould experience in the normal course of doing business do not constitute\nsubstantial and grievous economic injury. (2)  An employer who\nbelieves that reinstatement may be denied to a key employee must give written\nnotice to the employee at the time the employee gives notice of the need for\nFMLA leave (or when FMLA leave commences, if earlier) that he or she qualifies\nas a key employee.  The employer must also fully inform the employee of the\npotential consequences with respect to reinstatement and maintenance of health\nbenefits if the employer should determine that substantial and grievous\neconomic injury to the employer's operations will result if the employee is\nreinstated from FMLA leave.  An employer who fails to provide such timely\nnotice will lose its right to deny restoration even if substantial and grievous\neconomic injury will result from reinstatement. (3)  As soon as an\nemployer makes a good faith determination that substantial and grievous\neconomic injury to its operations will result if a key employee is reinstated,\nthe employer must notify the employee in writing of its determination and that\nit cannot deny FMLA leave but that it intends to deny restoration on completion\nof the FMLA leave.  The employer must serve this notice either in person or by\ncertified mail.  This notice must explain the basis for the employer's finding\nthat substantial and grievous economic injury will result, and, if leave has\ncommenced, must provide the employee a reasonable time in which to return to\nwork. (4)  After notification\nof the employer’s intent to deny restoration has been given to an employee, an\nemployee is still entitled to request reinstatement at the end of the leave\nperiod.  The employer must then again determine whether there will be\nsubstantial and grievous economic injury from reinstatement, based on the facts\nat that time.  If the determination remains the same, the employer must notify\nthe employee in writing (in person or by certified mail) of the denial of\nrestoration. (5)  If an employee\non leave does not return to work in response to the employer's notification of its\nintent to deny restoration, the employee continues to be entitled to\nmaintenance of health benefits and the employer may not recover its cost of\nhealth benefit premiums.  A key employee's rights under the FMLA continue\nunless and until the employee either gives notice that he or she no longer\nwishes to return to work, or the employer actually denies reinstatement at the\nconclusion of the leave period. 29 CFR 825.216(b), 825.217--825.219",
