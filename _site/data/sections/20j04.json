If an employer can qualify for one of these exemptions he need not\npay daily OT for hours in excess of 10 in a day when no Sec 7(a) weekly OT is\nworked by the employee. If an employee works two 14-hour days in a particular\nw/w (28 hours total for the w/w) no OT compensation is due as he has not\nexceeded the 40-hour weekly OT standard. But if an employee engaged in exempt\noperations worked three 14-hour days in a selected w/w (42 hours total for the\nw/w), payment of OT compensation would be due for 12 hours.",
