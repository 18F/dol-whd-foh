  "text": "(a)   If the\nemployer pays the employee’s share of premium payments to maintain health plan coverage\nwhen the employee fails to make payments, the employer may recover that expense\nfrom the employee. (b)   In\naddition, the employer may recover its share of health plan premiums during a\nperiod of unpaid FMLA leave from the employee if the employee fails to return\nto work after the FMLA leave entitlement has been exhausted or expires. \nHowever, the employer may not recover its costs if the employee does not return\ndue to a continued need for leave for a serious health condition of the\nemployee or eligible family member, or a serious illness or injury of a covered\nservicemember, or to other circumstances beyond the employee’s control. (1)  When the\nemployer cannot recover its share of benefit payments due to the employee’s continued\nneed for FMLA leave, the employer may require medical certification of the\nserious health condition of the employee or family member or the serious injury\nor illness of a covered servicemember.  If the employer requires such medical\ncertification, the certification must be provided to the employer within 30\ndays of the employer’s request.  It is the employee’s responsibility to provide\nthe certification and pay any cost incurred. (2)  If the employee\nfails to provide the certification, or the reason for leave does not meet the\ntest of circumstances beyond the employee’s control, the employer may recover\n100 percent of the health benefit premiums it paid during the period of unpaid\nFMLA leave. (c)   If an\nemployer elects to maintain other benefits by paying the employee’s share of\npremiums during unpaid FMLA leave, such as life insurance, disability\ninsurance, etc., at the conclusion of the leave, the employer is entitled to\nrecover only the costs incurred for paying the employee’s share of any\npremiums, whether or not the employee returns to work. WHD Opinion Letter\nFMLA-2006-3-AWHD Non-Administrator\nLetter FMLA-6 October 1, 1993 (d)   For the\npurposes of the employer’ recovery of benefit costs, an employee who has\nreturned to work for at least 30 calendar days is considered to have “returned”\nto work.  An employee who transfers directly from taking FMLA leave to\nretirement or who retires during the first 30 days after returning to work is\ndeemed to have returned to work. (e)   When paid\nleave is substituted for FMLA leave, the employer may not recover its share of\nbenefit premiums for any period of the FMLA leave covered by the paid leave. \nSimilarly, when FMLA leave runs concurrently with paid leave provided under\nworkers’ compensation or a temporary disability plan, recovery of premiums does\nnot apply. (f)   Self-insured\nemployers may recover only the employer’s share of allowable premiums as\ncalculated under COBRA, excluding the 2 percent fee for administrative costs. (g)   Any share\nof premiums that the employer is entitled to collect when an employee fails to\nreturn to work is a debt owed by the employee to the employer.  Such a debt\ndoes not alter the employer’s responsibilities for health benefit coverage or\npayment of claims incurred during the FMLA leave under a self-insurance plan. \nThe employer may recover the costs through deductions from any sums due to the\nemployee as allowed under State and Federal law, or the employer may initiate legal\naction against the employee to recover such costs. 29 CFR 825.212(b),\n825.213",
