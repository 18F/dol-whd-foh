  "text": "Name:     Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven\nwood-working machines. Originally Adopted:  August 1, 1941 (a)  \nScope of HO 5 (1)  Power-driven woodworking machines are among the most\nhazardous of all machine tools. Although great strides have been made by\nmanufacturers and OSHA to improve the safety of such machines through design\nchanges and guarding, the risk of injury to operators or workers assisting to\noperate such machines has not been eliminated.  Several hazardous factors are\ninherent to woodworking machines—extremely high speeds of operation, sharpness\nof cutting tools, and the lightness of material being cut making “kick-backs”\npossible.  The fact that many woodworking machines are hand fed increases the\nhazards.     (2)  This order is very broad in scope and is applied on a\nmachine basis.  Basically, if a minor, while performing covered employment, is\noperating, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and/or cleaning a\npower-driven wood working machine, HO 5 most likely applies. (3)  HO 5 does not apply when the machinery or tools are\ndesigned to be used, and are used exclusively, on materials other than\nwood—such as metal, plastic or stone.  Another HO (such as HO 8, 14, 16 or 17)\nmay prohibit such work. (4)  HO 5 applies in any industries where power-driven\nwoodworking tools are used—including furniture plants; sawmills, cabinet makers\nand other woodworking plants and shops; construction sites; packing sheds;\nretail and service establishments such as hardware and lumber stores; state and\nlocal government entities; and other industries which use power-driven\nwoodworking machines, but which may not directly manufacture wood products.  Even\nthough FLSA § 13(c)(7) exempts certain minors 14 to 17 years of age from\nthe HO 4 prohibition concerning the performance of work that entails entering a\nsawmill building, the HO 5 prohibitions regarding operating and assisting to\noperate power-driven woodworking machines are applicable to the employment of\nthose youth who may now legally work in a sawmill. (5)  Definitions a.    \nThe term power-driven woodworking\nmachine shall mean all fixed or portable machines or tools driven by power and\nused or designed for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing, stapling,\nwire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing, or printing wood,\nveneer, trees, logs, or lumber.  This definition is broad and includes machines\nused at the time the order was issued as well as all power-driven woodworking\nmachines developed in subsequent years.  It may also apply to multiple-use\nwoodworking machines as well as those designed for a single woodworking\npurpose.  A machine that was designed to be used on wood is prohibited by HO 5\neven when used to cut, shape, form, etc., a material other than wood. b.    \nThe term driven by power shall\nmean machines driven by electrical, animal, mechanical, water, or other power\nsuch as steam or hydraulic.  It also includes battery-operated and pneumatic-operated\nmachines and tools, but does not apply to machines or tools driven by foot or\nhand power, such as foot-powered jig saws or hand-operated saws or drills. c.    \nThe term off-bearing shall mean\nthe removal of material or refuse directly from a saw table or from the point\nof operation.  Operations not considered as off-bearing within the intent of HO\n5 include: 1.    \nThe removal of material or refuse\nfrom a circular saw or guillotine-action veneer clipper where the material or\nrefuse has been conveyed away from the saw table or point of operation by a\ngravity chute or by some mechanical means such as a moving belt or expulsion\nroller, and 2.    \nThe following operations when they\ndo not involve the removal of material or refuse directly from a saw or from\nthe point of operation: A.   \nThe carrying, moving, or\ntransporting of materials from one machine to another or from one part of a\nplant to another, B.   \nThe piling, stacking, or arranging\nof materials for feeding into a machine by another person, and C.   \nThe sorting, tying, bundling or\nloading of materials. (6)  The following examples of power-driven machines and\ntools, when used for “cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing, stapling,\nwire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing, or printing wood,\nveneer, trees, logs, or lumber” are subject to HO 5.  This list is not\nall-inclusive – other machines exist or may be developed which meet the\ndefinition of power-driven woodworking machines: a.    \nCutting – circular saw, band saw,\njig saw, drag saw, chain saw, veneer clipper. b.    \nShaping and forming – shaper,\nmolder, heel turner, lathe, tenoner, mortiser, sticker, drill, boring machine,\nhole cutter. c.    \nSurfacing – planer, jointer,\nsander, barker. d.    \nNailing – nailer, box nailer,\ncleat nailer, roofing gun, drywall gun (when used to attach drywall to wood\nstuds), siding gun, finishing nail gun. e.    \nStapling – stapler. f.     \nWire stitching – wire stitcher,\nberry-basket machine, bushel-tub machine. g.    \nFastening, or otherwise assembling\n– corrugator or other similar type machine for fastening two pieces of wood\ntogether by means of a metallic fastener of some type. h.    \nPressing – veneer press, boxboard\nsqueezer, and printing press used on wood. (7)  HO 5 prohibits minors from operating power-driven\nwoodworking equipment in sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, and cooperage\nstock mills—industries that are covered by HO 4.  HO 5 (rather than HO 4)\napplies to the planing-mill department or other re-manufacturing departments of\nthese enterprises when contained in buildings separate from the sawmill, lath\nmill, shingle mill or cooperage stock mill.  HO 5 also applies to the\nemployment of minors between the ages of 14 and 17 who, although now permitted\nto work in sawmills because of the exemption contained in FLSA § 13(c)(7),\nare found to have operated or assisted in the operation of, power-driven\nwoodworking machines. (8)  Guards.  The fact that a machine is guarded has no\neffect on the application of HO 5.  Woodworking machines are the most difficult\nto guard and guards alone cannot be relied upon to protect minors from the\nhazards of woodworking machines.  (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED (1)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the\noccupation of operating power-driven woodworking machines, including\nsupervising or controlling the operation of such machines, feeding material\ninto such machines, and helping the operator to feed material into such\nmachines. a.    \nThe occupations of operating\nwoodworking machines includes starting and stopping the machine, adjusting for\nthe type of work being performed, and placing the wood stock on the machine. \nMachines may be automatic, hand fed or power-fed.  b.    \nHO 5 does not prohibit these\nminors from placing materials on a moving chain or in a hopper or slide for\nautomatic feeding. (2)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the\noccupation of setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning\npower-driven woodworking machines. (3)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the\noccupation of off-bearing (unloading materials) from circular saws when the\nmaterial is not conveyed away from the machine by some mechanical means. (4)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the\noccupation of off-bearing (unloading materials) from guillotine-action veneer\nclippers when the material is not conveyed away from the point of operation by\na moving belt or gravity chain. (5)  The following is a partial list of power-driven\nwoodworking machines prohibited by HO 5. This equipment may be stationary or\nportable and may be powered by batteries: a.     Band saws.b.     Circular saws (table saws, swing\nsaws, portable saws, etc.).c.    \nSurfacing machines (planers,\nshapers, jointers, molders, matchers, stickers, panel raisers, tenoners, etc.). d.     Lathes.e.     Drills, boring machines, mortisers.f.     \nSanding machines (belt sanders,\ndisc sanders, drum sanders, cone sanders, etc.). g.     Nailing and stapling machines, wire\nstitchers, berry box machines.h.    \nVeneer presses, other pressing\nmachines; machines designed to print on wood. i.     \nWood chippers when used to shape\nthe wood for pressing into fiberboard such as in mills. j.      Veneer lathe.k.     Veneer clipper.l.      Veneer press. m.   Nail guns (as used to

poles.o.    \nChuckers used for tapering one end\nof a wooden handle, and “threaders” used to cut a screw thread on the other end\nfor later insertion into the threaded hole of a brush or broom. p.     Air clamps used to assemble\nfurniture.q.    \nRouters designed to be used on\nwood and used to finish countertops, molding and other wood products. r.     \nStruct-O-Matic and similar\nmachines used to press clamps into trusses during the manufacturing\npre-assembled roofing trusses.  (c)  \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED (1)  The following work in a planing-mill, box factory, or\nother remanufacturing department is permitted: a.    \nOff-bearing or tailing from: 1.     Band saws.2.    \nCircular saws when the material is\nconveyed away from the saw table by some mechanical means such as an expulsion\nroller (cleat saw), moving belt, or gravity chute. 3.     Planers, molders, or other surfacing\nmachines.4.     Sanding machines.5.     Nailing or wire-stitching

spreader.3.     Veneer drier.d.    \nCarrying or moving material from\none machine to another or otherwise handling or shipping veneer. (d)  \nExemptions  HO 5 does provide an exemption for apprentices and student-learners. \nThere are no other exemptions applicable.   (e)  \nEnforcement positions (1)  Chain saws HO 14 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from operating chain\nsaws—regardless of the material being processed.  HO 5 also prohibits the\noperation of chain saws to cut wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber because\nchain saws, when used as such, are “power-driven woodworking machines”.  HO 4\nalso prohibits the use of chain saws by minors in logging and sawmilling\noperations. (2)  Power-driven machines used to cut materials other than\nwood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber a.    \nHO 5 applies to any power-driven\nmachines used or designed for cutting or shaping wood, veneer, trees, logs, or\nlumber—regardless of what material is cut by it.   b.    \nHO 5 does not prohibit minors from\noperating machines designed and used exclusively to cut or shape plastic,\nleather, or items other than wood.  HO 14, however, may prohibit minors from\nusing circular saws, band saws, guillotine shears, wood chippers, reciprocating\nsaws, chain saws, and abrasive cutting discs to cut these materials.  c.    \nCertain machine tools are designed\nto cut or shape metal.  These tools may have the same name as woodworking tools\nand may share many characteristics of woodworking tools.  But if they are\ndesigned to be used on metal, they are not subject to HO 5.  Such tools include\nmetal drills, lathes, planers, grinders, borers, etc. (see FOH\n33h08 for a list of these machines). (3)  The following situations were determined not to fall\nunder HO 5, mainly because the power-driven woodworking machines were not used\nor designed to be used for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing,\nstapling, wire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing or\nprinting wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber: a.    \nOperation of staple machines in\nthe upholstery department of furniture manufacturers, in boat yards or\nautomobile repair shops, when used to attach vinyl, plastic film, webbing\nstraps, velcro, plastic molding or fabric to a wooden or plastic seat. b.    \nOperation of drywall screw guns\nwhen used only to attach drywall to metal studs. c.    \nOperation of belt sanders when the\nsandpaper is designed for use on products other than wood. d.    \nOperation of rivet machines used\nto attach hardware to other objects. e.    \nOperation of portable electric\ndrills used to bore holes in products other than wood, such as metal. f.     \nOperation of tumbler machines used\nto polish wood products. g.    \nOperation of electric, pneumatic\nand battery-operated screwdrivers which tighten screws but perform no work on\nthe wood itself. h.    \nOperation of routers designed to\nbe used on metal and used to finish metal countertops and other products not\nmade of wood (HO 8 does not apply to metal routers).",
