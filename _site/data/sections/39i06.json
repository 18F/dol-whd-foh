  "text": "(a)   An employer’s\nobligation to maintain health insurance coverage ceases under the FMLA if an\nemployee’s premium payment is more than 30 days late, unless the employer has\nan established policy providing a more generous grace period. (b)   Dropping\nemployee coverage In order to drop the\ncoverage for an employee whose premium payment is late, the employer must\nprovide written notice to the employee that the payment has not been received. \nSuch notice must be mailed to the employee at least 15 days before coverage is to\ncease, advising that coverage will be dropped on a specified date at least 15\ndays after the date of the letter unless the payment has been received before\nthen.  Coverage for the employee may be terminated at the end of the 30-day\ngrace period (where the 15 day notice has been provided) unless the employer\nhas established policies regarding other forms of unpaid leave that allow the\nemployer to end coverage retroactively to the date the unpaid premium payment\nwas due. (c)   Restoration\nof benefits entitlement remains (1)  When coverage\nlapses because the employee has not made required premium payments or any other\nvalid reason, upon the employee’s return to work the employer must restore the\nemployee to coverage and benefits that are equivalent to those the employee\nwould have had if leave had not been taken and the premium payment(s) had not\nbeen missed or coverage had not been canceled, including family or dependent\ncoverage.  The employee cannot be required to meet any qualification\nrequirements imposed by the plan, including any preexisting condition requirements\nor waiting period, to wait for an open season, or to pass a medical examination\nto obtain reinstatement of coverage. (2)  If an employer\nfails to restore the employee’s health insurance upon the employee’s return to\nwork, the employer may be liable for benefits lost, for other actual monetary\nlosses sustained as a direct result, and for appropriate equitable relief\ntailored to the harm suffered. (d)   Employer\npayment of employee’s share of premium payments An employer may\nchoose to pay an employee’s share of premium payments continuously while the\nemployee is on FMLA leave.  For example, an employer may choose to maintain an\nemployee’s group health plan benefits or other benefits, such as life insurance\nor disability insurance, during an employee’s FMLA leave to avoid a lapse of\ncoverage and ensure that it can meet its responsibilities to provide equivalent\nbenefits upon the employee’s return to work.  If the employer elects to\nmaintain such benefits during the leave, at the conclusion of the leave, the\nemployer is entitled to recover the costs incurred for paying for the\nemployee’s share of any premiums whether or not the employee returns to work.  See\nFOH 39i07. 29 CFR 825.212",
