  "text": "(a)  \nUnder 29 CFR § 541.601, an employee who receives total\nannual compensation of at least $100,000 is considered exempt if the employee\n“customarily and regularly” performs any one or more of the exempt duties or\nresponsibilities of an executive, administrative or professional employee\nidentified in 29 CFR part 541 subparts B, C or D.  “Customarily and regularly”\nmeans greater than occasional but may be less than constant, and includes work\nnormally and recurrently performed every workweek but does not include isolated\nor one-time tasks.   29\nCFR §§ 541.601, 541.707  (b)  \n (1)  “Total annual\ncompensation” must include at least $455/wk paid on a salary or fee basis. See 29\nCFR §§ 541.602, 541.605.  Thus, highly compensated employees must receive at\nleast the same base salary throughout the year as required for exempt employees\nunder the standard exemption tests, while allowing highly compensated employees\nto receive additional income in the form of commissions and nondiscretionary\nbonuses.  Total annual compensation may include commissions, nondiscretionary\nbonuses and other nondiscretionary compensation earned during a 52-week\nperiod.  Total annual compensation does not include board, lodging and other\nfacilities as defined in 29 CFR § 541.606, and does not include payments for\nmedical insurance, payments for life insurance, contributions to retirement\nplans and the cost of other fringe benefits. 29 CFR § 541.\n601(b)(1)  (2)  Whether bonuses\nor other forms of compensation are discretionary or nondiscretionary is\ndetermined by applying the principles in the Act and regulations defining\ndiscretionary bonuses in 29 U.S.C. § 207(e)(3)(a) and 29 CFR § 778.211.  (Under\nthese principles, discretionary bonuses are excluded from an employee’s regular\nrate of pay; nondiscretionary bonuses must be included in the regular rate. \nSimilarly, under the highly compensated employee test, all nondiscretionary\nbonuses and any other form of nondiscretionary compensation earned during the\nyear are counted, together with the employee’s salary, towards the $100,000\nthreshold.)  If the employer retains the discretion as to both the fact that a\npayment will be made and the amount of the payment until at or near the point\nin time that the payment is to be made, the payment is discretionary;\notherwise, it is nondiscretionary.  If an employer promises in advance to pay a\nbonus, it is nondiscretionary.  If, under the terms of an employment agreement,\nan employee has a contract right, express or implied, to receive a particular\ntype of payment, it is nondiscretionary.   The following types\nof payments are considered nondiscretionary:  a.    \nPayments made pursuant to any prior contract, agreement, or\npromise causing the employee to expect such payments regularly (e.g.,\ncommissions or bonuses paid monthly or quarterly based on the amount of sales\nor profits), b.    \nBonuses that are promised to employees upon hiring, c.    \nBonuses that result from collective bargaining, d.    \nBonuses that are announced ahead of time to induce\nemployees to complete assignments more quickly, more efficiently, or more\ncost-effectively; (such as attendance bonuses, individual or group production\nbonuses, or bonuses for quality and accuracy of work), e.    \nBonuses that are made contingent upon the employee\nremaining employed with the employer until the time the payment is to be made. All forms of\nnondiscretionary compensation are included when determining if a highly\ncompensated employee has received not less than $100,000 in total annual\ncompensation. (3)  If an\nemployee’s total annual compensation does not total at least $100,000 by the\nfinal pay period of the 52-week period, the employer may, during the last pay\nperiod or within one month after the end of the 52-week period, make one final payment\nsufficient to achieve the $100,000 compensation level.  Any such final payment\nmade after the end of the 52-week period may count only toward the prior year’s\ntotal annual compensation and not toward the total annual compensation in the\nyear it was paid.  If the employer fails to make such a payment, the employee\ndoes not qualify as a highly compensated employee, but may be tested for\nexemption under the standard exemption tests in 29 CFR part 541 subparts B, C\nor D. 29 CFR §\n541.601(b)(2)  (4)  An employee who\ndoes not work a full year for the employer, either because the employee is\nnewly hired after the beginning of the year or ends the employment before the\nend of the year, may qualify for exemption as a highly compensated employee if\nthe employee receives a pro rata portion of the minimum $100,000 annual amount,\nbased upon the number of weeks that the employee will be or has been employed. \nAn employer may make one final payment as under 22g01(b)(3) within one month\nafter the end of the employee’s employment. 29 CFR §\n541.601(b)(3)  (5)  The employer\nmay utilize any 52-week period as the compensation year, such as a calendar\nyear, a fiscal year, or an anniversary of hire year.  If the employer does not\nidentify some other year period in advance, the calendar year will be applied. 29 CFR §\n541.601(b)(4) (c)  \nA high level of compensation is a strong indicator of a\n“white collar” employee’s exempt status, thus eliminating the need for a\ndetailed analysis of the employee’s particular job duties.  A highly\ncompensated employee will qualify for exemption if the employee customarily and\nregularly performs any one or more of the exempt duties or responsibilities of\nan executive, administrative or professional employee identified in 29 CFR part\n541 subparts B, C or D.  For example, an employee may qualify as a highly compensated\nexecutive employee if the employee customarily and regularly directs the work\nof two or more other employees, even though the employee does not meet all of\nthe other requirements for the executive exemption under 29 CFR § 541.100.   29\nCFR § 541.601(c) 69\nFR 22173 through 22174 (d)  \nThe highly compensated employee exemption applies only to\nemployees whose primary duty includes performing office or non-manual work. \nThus, for example, non-management production-line workers and non-management\nemployees in maintenance, construction and similar occupations such as\ncarpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen,\noperating engineers, longshoremen, construction workers, laborers and other\nemployees who perform work involving repetitive operations with their hands,\nphysical skill and energy cannot qualify for exemption under this test no\nmatter how highly paid they might be.   29\nCFR § 541.601(d)",
