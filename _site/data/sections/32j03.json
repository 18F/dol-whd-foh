When it is necessary to use a formula\nof this type, one should be selected which will result in a reasonable relation\nbetween the cost of renting equipment and the wages paid to operators. (b)  \nWherever possible, clause (1)\nabove shall be followed. Clause (2) shall be followed only when clause (1)\ncannot be used, and clause (3) shall be used only as a last resort. (c)  \nIn order to be in compliance in\nthe future, particularly as to the record-keeping regulations, employers shall\nbe required to break down the compensation paid into labor rates and equipment\nrental. By agreement with the employees involved, separate rates shall be\nestablished for the rental of the equipment and for the labor. (d)  \nThe separate rates for labor and\nequipment rentals thus established, wherever they appear unreasonable or\ndisproportionate, shall be scrutinized for possible evasion of the OT\nrequirements of the FLSA or PCA. Such evasions might be evident, for example,\nif the rates set up for labor of an owner-operator are grossly out-of-line with\nthe rate paid by the same employer to operators of similar company-owned\nequipment or with the prevailing rate in the area for such operators. It may be\nfound that in breaking down the rates which covered both the equipment and\nlabor, the employer has allocated an unreasonable or disproportionate part of the\nrate to the equipment rental with the intent of diminishing the regular rate of\npay on which OT has to be computed. (e)  \nThe half time OT premium on a\nregular rate determined as above shall be paid in addition to the total\ncontract earnings and may not be charged to or deducted from equipment\nearnings.",
