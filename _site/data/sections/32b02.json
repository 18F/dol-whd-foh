This sum is then\ndivided by the number of hours worked in the week to yield the pieceworker’s\n“regular rate” for that week. In some cases, the pieceworker is hired on a\npiece rate basis with a minimum hourly guarantee. Where the total piece rate\nearnings for the week fall short of the amount that would be earned for the\ntotal hours at the guaranteed rate, the employee is paid the difference. In\nthose weeks in which the “make-up” payment is made, the employee is in fact\npaid at an hourly rate and the minimum hourly guaranty which he was paid is his\nregular rate for that week.",
