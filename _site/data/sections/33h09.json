  "text": "Name:  Occupations in Connection with Mining, Other than\nCoal Originally Adopted:  January 6, 1951 (a)  \nScope of HO 9 (1)  Prior to the enactment of HO 9, only coal\nmining (HO 3) was covered by a hazardous occupations order.  Since the issuance\nof HO 9, all mining, with the exception of mining in the petroleum and natural\ngas industries, falls within the scope of a hazardous occupations order.  An\ninvestigation of the mining industry concluded, in an April 1950 report, that\nall work in this industry involved an “exceptionally high degree of accident\nrisk” and the employment of young people should be prohibited in the vast\nmajority of mining occupations.  Moreover, the report cited inadequate state\nchild labor laws, which in many instances allowed children as young as 14 years\nof age to work in underground mines, as an additional reason for establishing\nHO 9. (2)  HO 9 is industry specific.  It applies to\nmetal mines, nonmetal mines, ore-dressing plants, quarries, clay pits and clay\nmines, and sand and gravel operations.  In terms of product mined, the HO\ncovers:  iron, copper, lead, zinc, and other metals, barite, gypsum, salt,\nsulfur, and other nonmetals, limestone, marble, granite, and other minerals. \nIts scope includes all occupations in connection with mining, other than coal,\nwith the exception of certain surface occupations not directly concerned with\nthe extraction or haulage of the mined material. (3)  Many occupations prohibited by HO 9 may\nalso be prohibited by other HOs.  Examples include operating motor-vehicles (HO\n2), using a power-driven chain saw to cut timber (HO 5), and operating some\nearth moving equipment while working in a tunnel (HO 17).   (4)  HO 9 does not cover work in coal mines\nwhich is prohibited by HO 3; in petroleum production; or in the production of\nnatural-gas.  The HO also does not prohibit work involving most manufacturing\nor processing operations applied to the extracted materials. (5)  Definitions a.    \nThe term all\noccupations in connection with mining, other than coal shall mean: 1.    \nAll work performed\nunderground in mines and quarries; on the surface at underground mines and\nunderground quarries; in or about open-cut mines, open quarries, clay pits, and\nsand and gravel operations; at or about placer mining operations; at or about\ndredging operations for clay, sand or gravel; at or about bore-hole mining\noperations; in or about all metal mills, washer plants, or grinding mills\nreducing the bulk of the extracted minerals and at or about any other crushing,\ngrinding, screening, sizing, washing or cleaning operations performed upon the\nextracted minerals except when those operations are performed as part of a\nmanufacturing process. 2.    \nThe term shall not\ninclude work performed in subsequent manufacturing or processing operations,\nsuch as work performed in:  smelters, electro-metallurgical plants, refineries,\nreduction plants, cement mills, plants where quarried stone is cut, sanded and\nfurther processed, or plants manufacturing clay, glass, or ceramic products.  3.    \nNeither shall the term\ninclude work performed in connection with coal mining (see HO 3,\nFOH 33h03),\nin petroleum production, in natural-gas production, nor in dredging operations\nwhich are not a part of mining operations, such as dredging for construction or\nnavigation purposes. b.    \nThe term placer mining\nshall mean the mining of a placer deposit (a surface deposit of loose particles\nof certain heavy minerals—frequently gold) utilizing the following methods: 1.    \nPlacer dredging\noperations – Operating in a pond, a placer dredge (a kind of floating washer\nplant) utilizes a series of buckets connected by a chain to scoop gravel from\nthe bottom of the pond.  The dredge is also equipped with machinery to recover\nthe heavy metal from the gravel and dispose of the refuse.  2.    \nSurface placer\noperations – This method, often called sluicing, requires a source of water\nlarge enough to make a fast-flowing stream in a sluice box.  At the upper end\nof the sluice there is a screen onto which gravel is shoveled or dumped.  Water\nruns over the gravel on the screen, washing the fine gravel through it, and the\nheavy metal is caught on a bar fastened across bottom of the sluice box. 3.    \nHydraulic placer\noperations – In this method, a powerful stream of water is used to break down\nearth and rock and guide the particles through channels into long sluices. \nDiesel power is used extensively for pumps, tractors, or for drag lines, and\nsome operations use tractors equipped with a blade to push the material to the\nsluice box. c.    \nThe term bore-hole\nmining shall mean a method of recovering some minerals (most notably sulfur and\nsalt) by pumping compressed air into the holes bored down to the deposit to\nforce the mineral to the surface. d.    \nThe term metal mill\noperations shall mean a highly automated operation requiring few employees\nconsisting of three distinct steps:   1.    \nPreparation (crushing,\ngrinding, cleaning, and classifying),  2.    \nSeparation (jigging,\ntabling, heavy-media separation, and froth flotation), and  3.    \nFinishing (including\nsettling, filtering, drying, and otherwise preparing the concentrates for\nshipment). e.    \nThe term washer plant\noperations shall mean an operation performed to the ore after it is mined to\nremove clay and dirt form the solids. f.     \nThe term grinding mill\noperations shall mean the reduction of the concentrate into a powder form at a\ngrinding mill.  This operation that occurs after the ore is cleansed at a\nwasher plant. (b)  \nOccupations\nPROHIBITED (1)  All occupations involving underground work\nin mines or underground quarries. (2)  All surface occupations at underground\nmines unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(1). (3)  All occupations involving work in or about\nopen cut mines, open quarries (including crushing, screening, and washing),\nclay pits (including dredging), and sand and gravel operations (including\ndredging, washing, and screening), unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(2). (4)  All occupations involving work at or about\nplacer mining and bore-hole mining operations, unless otherwise permitted by\nFOH 33h09(c)(1). (5)  All occupations involving work in metal\nmills, unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(2). (6)  All occupations involving work in washer\nplants or grinding mills, unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(1). (c)  \nOccupations NOT\nSPECIFICALLY BANNED (1)  The following occupations are permitted\nfor 16- and 17- year-olds when performed at the surface of underground mines;\nin or about open pit mines, open quarries, clay pits and sand and grave\noperations; in surface placer mines, including placer dredging operations,\nhydraulic placer mining operations and bore-hole mining operations; and in\nwasher plants or grinding mills: a.    \nWork in offices, in\nthe warehouse or supply house, in the change house, in the laboratory, and in\nrepair or maintenance shops not located underground.  In the case of open\nquarries and other types of open-pit operations, this work is permitted in the\npit or quarry proper, but not outside of the building itself. b.    \nWork in the operation\nand maintenance of living quarters (Some of this work may be prohibited by\nanother HO). c.    \nWork outside of the\nmine in surveying, in the repair and maintenance of roads, and in general\nclean-up about the mine property (such as clearing brush and digging drainage\nditches).  This work is not permitted when done underground or in an open\nquarry or pit.  For example, maintenance of roads in an open-cut mine would\nonly be allowed if it was done outside of the open-cut. (2)  The following work is permitted in metal mills:   a.    \nWork involving the operation of\njigs, sludge tables, flotation cells, or drier-filters. b.    \nHand-sorting work at picking table\nor a picking belt. c.    \nGeneral clean-up work. d.    \nWork of track crews in the building\nand maintenance of railroad tracks located in an area of an open-cut metal\nmine, if haulage and mining activities are not being conducted where the track\ncrew is working.  This exception applies only to metal mines, since such\noperations are vast in scale, much of the track work is physically removed from\nthe extractive operation, and the track crew can work without undue exposure to\nhazard. e.    \nThe only work permitted in\nmercury-recovery mills or mills using the cyanide process is the kind of work\nstated in FOH 33h09(c)(1) above. (d)  \nExemptions There are no provisions in HO 9 for apprentices or\nstudent-learners.  There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.   (e)  \nEnforcement\npositions (1)  Peat moss HO 9 does\nnot apply to cutting, gathering, piling or any other occupation performed on\npeat moss.  Peat moss is defined as partially decomposed sphagnum;\nconsequently, it is not a mineral within the meaning of this order and any\nactivities performed on it or to it would not be “occupations in connection with\nmining.” (2)  Motor-vehicle operator and outside helper HO 9\nprohibits almost all work in or about a mine, which would include the\noccupations of motor-vehicle driver and outside helper.  HO 2 also specifically\nprohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from performing the occupations of motor-vehicle\ndriver and outside helper in or about any mine, including an open pit mine or\nquarry.   (3)  Weighing trucks The\nweighing of trucks filled with gravel, crushed stone, or other minerals is\nprohibited by HO 9.  This work is prohibited even if the minors spend only a\nsmall percentage of their time weighing trucks and the majority of their work\nis confined to an office environment.   (4)  Processing stockpiled limestone into lime HO 9 does\nnot apply to occupations involved in the processing of stockpiled limestone\ninto hydrated lime.  This process is deemed to be manufacturing and not mining\n(the crushed stockpiled limestone is heated at extreme temperatures to create\nquicklime, water is then added to the quicklime to make hydrated lime which is\nshipped to the consumer).  The prohibitions of HO 9 would cease to apply when\nthe extracted, crushed, and screened limestone was stockpiled. (5)  Railroad track work Track work\nperformed three miles from the open quarry is not an occupation prohibited by\nHO 9 as the work is not in close proximity to the mining haulage or to mining\nactivities.  (6)  Processing marble into a finished building\nproduct a.    \nThe prohibitions of HO\n9 apply to occupations in the processing of marble into a finished building\nmaterial when it involves the following steps:  the marble is quarried, run\nthrough a primary crusher, through a secondary crusher or grinding operation, and\nthen into elevated storage bins.  The finished product is loaded from these\nbins into bulk trucks or it is sacked and stored for later shipment.   b.     This process is not deemed to be\nmanufacturing since the marble has not been chemically changed and nothing was\nmanufactured from the crushed marble (i.e. bricks, blocks, tile, etc.)",
