(See 29 C.F.R.\n4.123(d)(1).) (2) \nPostal Service contracts entered\ninto with individual owner-operators of vehicles for transportation of mail\nwhere it is not contemplated at the time the contract is made that the\nowner-operator will hire any service employee except for brief periods of time\nsuch as vacation, or for unexpected contingencies or emergency situations such\nas illness or accident. Application of this exemption depends on conditions\nexisting at the time the contract is made. If the criteria for the exemption\nhave been met, then SCA WD requirements would not apply to anyone subsequently\nengaged in the performance of the contract services during the term of the\ncontract for reasons within the limitations described in 29 C.F.R. 4.123(d)(2).\nThe term owner-operator refers to an individual, not a partnership, two closely\nrelated individuals (“mom & pop operations”), or a corporation. (3) \nContracts for the carriage of\nfreight or personnel where such carriage is subject to rates covered by Sec\n10721 of the Interstate Commerce Act. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(d)(3).); (4) \nPrime contracts and subcontracts\nfor the seven types of “commercial services” identified immediately below where\nan employee’s work on a Government service contract represents a small portion\nof time when compared to the balance of time spent on commercial work and where\nadditional specific criteria for exclusion from SCA coverage are satisfied.\nThis exemption does not apply to solicitations and contracts for any of the\nseven services listed below that are: (1) entered into under the\nJavits-Wagner-O’Day Act, 41 U.S.C. 47; (2) for the operation of a Government\nfacility or portion thereof (“GOCO” or “GOPO”) (but may apply to subcontracts);\nor (3) subject to Section 4(c) of the SCA, as well as options or extensions\nunder contracts subject to Section 4(c) provisions. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.123(e)(2).) The seven commercial services are:                                              \na.     Automotive (fleet of automobiles) or other vehicle\n(e.g., aircraft) normal maintenance services (other than contracts to operate a\nGovernment motor pool). (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(A).)                                             \nb.     Financial services involving the issuance and\nservicing of cards (including credit cards, debit cards, purchase cards, smart\ncards, and similar card services) for use by traveling Federal employees or to\nmake small purchases of commercial items to meet the day-to-day needs of a\nFederal agency. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(B).)                                              \nc.     Contracts with hotels/motels for conferences of\nlimited duration (e.g., 1-5 days) that may include lodging, meals, and space\n(e.g., conference rooms) as part of the contract. This exemption does not cover\ncontracts for lodging on an as needed or continuing basis (e.g., lodging for\nmilitary recruits or for employees attending training at a training center over\na longer period of time). (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(C).)                                             \nd.     Maintenance, calibration, repair, and/or installation\n(not subject to the DBA, as provided in 29 C.F.R. 4.116(c)(2)) for all types of\nequipment where the services are obtained from the manufacturer or supplier\nunder a contract awarded on a sole source basis. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.123(e)(2)(i)(D).)                                              \ne.     Transportation by common carrier of persons by air,\nmotor vehicle, rail, or marine vessel on regularly scheduled routes or via\nstandard commercial services (e.g., “City Pairs” contracts) (does not include\ncharter services). (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(E).)                                              \nf.     Real estate services, including real property\nappraisal services related to housing Federal agencies or disposing of real\nproperty owned by the Federal government. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(F).)                                              \ng.     Relocation services, including services of real estate\nbrokers and appraisers, to assist Federal employees or military personnel in\nbuying and selling homes (which shall not include actual moving or storage of\nhousehold goods and related services). (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(G).) (b)  The following categories of service employees have a\nvariation to the prevailing wage requirements pursuant to Section 4(b): (1) \nWorkers with disabilities – The SCA, like the FLSA, allows an employer to pay\napprentices, student-learners, workers with disabilities in competitive\nemployment, and workers with disabilities in rehabilitation facilities at\nspecial minimum wages (SMWs) that are less than the prevailing wages required\nby the WD. The SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.6(o) instructs the employer to follow the same\n\"conditions and procedures\" required for the employment of such workers\nas are set forth in Section 14 of the FLSA. This regulatory exception is from\nthe prevailing wage only. Employers are still required to pay the full FBs, or\nequivalent cash payment in lieu of providing FBs, to service employees with\ndisabilities for the work performed. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(o)(1) and 4.152(c)(2).)\nA SMW or commensurate wage will be based upon the prevailing wage listed in the\napplicable SCA WD for the classification of work to be performed on the\ncontract. It will be determined by the individual productivity of the workers\nwith disabilities in proportion to the productivity of experienced workers\nwithout disabilities who perform essentially the same type, quality, and\nquantity of work. (See SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.6(o)(1); FLSA 29 C.F.R. Part 525) (2) \nApprentices – Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the\nSCA predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and\nindividually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a\nState apprenticeship agency that is recognized by DOL, or, if no such\nrecognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office\nof Apprenticeship, ETA, DOL. The terms and conditions of the approved program\nwill be followed in the employment of apprentices. Wage rates paid apprentices\nmust not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in\nthe registered program, usually expressed as a percentage of the\njourneyworker’s rate in the applicable WD. The allowable ratio of apprentices\nto journeyworkers employed on the contract work must not be greater than the\nratio permitted to the contractor under the registered program. Any employee\nwho is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program must be paid the\nwage rate and FBs contained in the applicable WD for the journeyworker\nclassification of work actually performed.
