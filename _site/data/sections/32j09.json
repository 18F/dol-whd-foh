It is\nexplained in this section of the IB that the parties may agree to exclude from\nhours worked those activities, such as eating meals between working hours,\nwhich would not be hours worked even if they were paid for pursuant to a\ncontract, custom, or practice. Sec 778.320(b) states further that where “the\nparties have agreed to exclude such activities from hours worked, payments for\nsuch time will be regarded as qualifying for exclusion from the regular rate\nunder the provisions of section 7(e)(2)” of the FLSA.",
