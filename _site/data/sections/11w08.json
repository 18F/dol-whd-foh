The first group\ncomprises those goods purchased by the wholesaler upon the order of a customer\nwith the definite intention that the goods shall be carried at once to the\ncustomer. (b)   The second group comprises those goods obtained by the\nwholesaler from the manufacturer or supplier to meet the needs of specified\ncustomers pursuant to some understanding with the customer even though not\nnecessarily for immediate delivery. The Court ruled that the goods comprising\neach of these two groups are within the channels of interstate commerce until\ndelivery is finally effected to the specific customer, known and intended at\nthe time of purchase by the wholesaler. (c)   The third group comprises those goods the orders for\nwhich have been based, by the wholesaler, on anticipation of the needs of a\nstable group of specific customers rather than upon prior orders or\nunderstandings.",
