  "text": "(a)  \n29 CFR 570.34(l) permits\n15-year-olds, but not 14-year-olds, to be employed to perform lifeguard duties\nat traditional swimming pools and water amusement parks when such youth have\nbeen trained and certified by the American Red Cross, or a similar certifying\norganization, in aquatics and water safety.  Section 570.34(l) was incorporated\ninto the Regulation by the 2008 Final Rule and replaces an enforcement position\npreviously adopted by WH.   (1)  The core and defining duty of a lifeguard is to rescue\nswimmers in danger of drowning, often by entering the water and physically\nbringing the swimmer to safety (see 75 FR 28418).  CL Reg. 3 now prohibits the\nemployment of anyone under 15 years of age to perform this core duty; and\n15-year-olds may do so only when properly certified.  (2)  Any employee under the age of 16 whose duties include\nthis core duty—such as a “junior lifeguard” or a “swim teacher aide”—or whose\nemployment could place him or her in a situation where the employer would\nreasonably expect him or her to perform such rescue duties, would be performing\nthe duties of a lifeguard while working is such a position.  For such\nemployment to comply with CL Reg. 3, the employee must be at least 15 years of\nage and be properly certified.   (3)  A 15-year-old who has been properly certified as a\nlifeguard, may also serve as a swimming instructor, but only when he or she has\nalso been properly certified as a swimming instructor by the American Red Cross\nor some other recognized certifying agency (see 29 CFR 570.34(l)(2)). (b)  \nWhere 15-year-old lifeguards may\nand may not be employed: (1)  Traditional swimming pools   a.    \nProperly certified 15-year-old\nlifeguards may be employed at traditional swimming pools.  A traditional\nswimming pool means a water tight structure of concrete, masonry, or other\napproved materials located either indoors or outdoors, used for bathing or\nswimming and filled with a filtered and disinfected water supply, together with\nbuildings, appurtenances and equipment used in connection therewith.  b.    \nThe provisions of § 570.34(l)\napply irrespective of who owns, operates, or manages the pool.  Therefore, such\nminors could be employed at hotel pools, apartment complex pools, and homeowner\nassociation pools, as well as community pools.   (2) \nWater amusement parks   a.    \nProperly certified 15-year-olds\nmay be employed as lifeguards at most facilities of a water amusement park.  A\nwater amusement park means an establishment that not only encompasses the\nfeatures of a traditional swimming pool, but also includes such additional attractions\nas wave pools, lazy rivers, baby pools, activities areas,\nand elevated water slides.  b.    \nFifteen- year-olds may serve as\nlifeguards at the wave pools, the lazy rivers, the activities areas, the baby\npools, and at the receiving or splashdown areas of the elevated water slides. c.    \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds may not\nbe stationed at the top of an elevated water slide to monitor the slide\noperations, keep order, and serve as “dispatcher” to ensure patrons properly\nride the slide.  The general prohibition against operating or tending\npower-driven equipment contained in CL Reg. 3 prohibits youth under 16 from\nperforming these “nontraditional” lifeguard duties at the top or on the stairs\nof an elevated slide.  This same prohibition prevents youth under 16 from being\nemployed to operate or tend, or serve as “attendants” on, amusement park rides (3)  Natural environments.  No one under 16 years of age\nmay be employed as a lifeguard at rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, quarries,\nreservoirs, wharfs, piers, canals, oceanside beaches, nor other natural\nenvironments.  (c)  \nThe duties 15-year-old lifeguards\nmay perform include the following: (1)  Rescuing swimmers in danger of drowning, (2)  Monitoring activities at poolside to prevent\naccidents, (3)  Providing swimming lessons, but only if properly\ncertified to do so (see FOH 33d06(e)(3)a below, (4)  Teaching water safety, (5)  Providing assistance to patrons, (6)  Helping maintain order and cleanliness in the pool and\npool areas, (7)  Conducting and officiating at swim meets, (8)  Administering first aid, (9)  Checking in and out items such as towels, and personal\nitems such as rings, watches, and apparel, (10)  Using a ladder to access and descend from a lifeguard\nchair, (11)  Using hand tools to clean the pool and pool area, and (12)  Testing and recording water quality for temperature\nand/or Ph levels, using all of the tools of the testing process including\nadding chemicals to the test water sample. (d)  \nThe duties 15-year-old lifeguards\nmay not perform include the following: (1)  Such youth may not enter or work in any mechanical\nroom or chemical storage area, including any areas where the filtration and\nchlorinating systems are housed. (2)  Such youth may not operate or tend any power-driven\nequipment, including power-driven elevated water slides often found at water\namusement parks and some swimming pools. a.    \nCL Reg. 3 prohibits the employment\nof youths under 16 years of age as dispatchers or attendants at the top of\nelevated water slides performing such tasks as maintaining order, directing\npatrons as to when to depart the top of the slide, and ensuring that patrons\nhave begun their “ride” safely (see § 570.34(l)(2)). b.    \nProperly certified 15-year-old\nlifeguards may be stationed at the “splashdown pools” at the bottom of the\nelevated water slides to perform those permitted duties listed in FOH 33d06(b)\nabove. c.    \nThe prohibition concerning tending\npower-driven water slides would not apply to those small water slides designed\nfor use by very small children and often located in “baby pools.”  These slides\nnormally rise no more than five or ten feet are accessed by ramps that patrons\nwalk up rather than stairways or ladders.  Properly certified 15-year-old\nlifeguards may tend these little slides designed for very small children. (e)  \nCertification (1)  29 CFR 570.34(l) requires that 15-year-olds be trained\nand certified in water safety and aquatics by the American Red Cross or a\nsimilar certifying agency, before they may be employed as lifeguards or to\nperform the core duties of a lifeguard as discussed in FOH 33d06(a)(1) above. (2)  Normally, the youth will have in his or her custody a\ncertificate documenting that he or she has successfully completed all classroom\nand practical skill sets necessary for certification as a lifeguard.  Such\ncertification will normally be sufficient for purposes of establishing\ncompliance with this portion of CL Reg. 3. (3)  As per § 570.34(l)(2), 15-year-olds who, as part of\ntheir employment, serve as swimming instructors—teaching others how to\nswim—must not only hold proper certification as a lifeguard, but must also be\ncertified as a swimming instructor by the American Red Cross or some other\nrecognized certifying organization. (4)  Once a lifeguard turns 16 years of age, this dual\nrequirement for certification, just as all the other provisions of CL Reg. 3,\nend.  (5)  WH has determined that the following organizations\noffer lifeguard certification programs that are similar to that offered by the\nAmerican Red Cross and therefore satisfy the requirements of § 570.34(l).  This\nlist is not to be considered exhaustive. a.    \nAmerican Lifeguard Association (www.americanlifeguard.com). b.    \nEllis &\nAssociates (www.jellis.com).  c.    \nNational Aquatic Safety Company (NASCO)
