The usual tests for such individual coverage apply. (c)           \nThe language of Sec 3(s) of the\n1966 Amendments--”. . . including employees handling, selling, or otherwise\nworking on goods . . .“--was changed in the 1974 Amendments to “. . . or\nemployees handling, selling or otherwise working on goods or materials ... .“\nBy changing the word “including” to “or”, Congress indicated its intention to\nreflect more clearly that this is an additional basis of coverage. The 1974\nAmendments also added the words “or materials” to make clear the Congressional\nintent to include within this additional basis of coverage the handling of\ngoods consumed in the employer’s business, e.g., the soap used by a laundry. (d)          \n  (1)  The 1977 amendments established a new Sec 3(s)(2) for\ncoverage of enterprises comprised exclusively of one or more retail or service\nestablishments and whose AGV of sales or business done (exclusive of the usual\nexcise taxes) is not less than: $275,000 effective 7/1/78 $325,000 effective 7/1/80 $362,500 effective 1/1/82 (2)  Sec 3(s) was further amended in 1977 to require that\nthose retail or service enterprises which were subject to Sec 6(a)(1) on June\n30. 1978, and which were removed from coverage under Sec 3(s)(2) because the\nAGV is less than the sales volume tests, must (if the AGV does not fall below\n$250,00) pay its employees not less than the MW in effect on the day before\ncoverage was lost. Such newly uncovered retail or service enterprises are\nrequired to pay OT.",
