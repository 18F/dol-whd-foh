  "text": "(a)   In some instances a Government agency (or a State or\npolitical subdivision thereof using Federal money) may perform construction\nwork under what is generally known as “force account”. In essence, this is a\n“do-it-yourself” type of construction - the governmental agency receiving the\ngrant decides not to contract out the work but actually performs it “in-house”\nwith its own employees. Such work is not generally subject to DBRA/CWHSSA\nbecause governmental agencies and States or their political subdivisions are\nnot considered “contractors” or “subcontractors” within the meaning of the D-B\nAct. However, any part of the work not done under “force account” but\ncontracted out is subject to DBRA/CWHSSA in the usual manner. (b)  Certain related acts require payment of prevailing\nwages to all laborers and mechanics “employed in the construction (or\ndevelopment) of the project” (e.g., the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 and the\nHousing Act of 1949). (See FOH l5e13.) State and local government agencies\nreceiving Federal assistance under statutes containing this or similar wording\nnot restricting coverage to employees of contractors or subcontractors, which\nperform construction with their own employees, must pay such employees\naccording to DBRA/CWHSSA.",
