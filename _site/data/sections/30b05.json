  "text": "(a)   Many\nemployers, especially in retail enterprises, compensate certain employees\nwholly or in part on a commission basis. The methods of computation and payment\ninvolving commissions vary widely (see IB 779.413) and the determination of\nMW/OT compliance must be made on the facts of each case. The general principles\n(except in circumstances where Sec 7(i) is applicable) are as follows: (b)   If an\nemployee paid wholly or in part on a commission basis is subject to OT, the\nprinciples set out in IB 778.117 - 778.122 shall be followed. (c)   If an\nemployee paid on a commission basis is exempt from OT, such as salespersons\nreferred to in Sec 13(b)(l0) of FLSA, the following shall be used in determining\nwhether the employee is paid in compliance with MW requirements: (1)  There is no\nrequirement that wages be paid weekly, as long as some regular pay period (such\nas biweekly or monthly) is established by the employer. The only requirement is\nthat employees receive “prompt payment” of the MW covering all hours worked\nduring the pay period. (2)  A “settlement\nperiod” does not have to coincide with the regular pay period. However, in the\nabsence of strong evidence to the contrary, it must be assumed that an employer\nintended that a settlement period for commissions represents the pay period for\nthe affected employees. Where a pay (settlement) period exceeds one month, the\nfacts should be developed and the issue submitted to the NO (Attn: AA/OPO)\nsince the bona fides of the pay (settlement) period raise serious questions as\nto the validity of the pay arrangement. (3)  Periodic draws\nagainst commission earnings within the pay (settlement) period need not equal\nthe MW. Employers may credit these draw or guarantee payments against their MW\nobligation when settling out the amount due employees at the end of the pay\n(settlement) period. The following examples illustrate this principle. Assume a\n4-week month and that a commission salesperson exempt from OT works 50 hours a\nweek (50 x $3.35 - $167.50):                                              \na.     The\nemployer has established payment of a weekly draw against commissions and a\nmonthly pay (settlement) period. The salesperson draws $125 a week against\nearned commissions. By the pay (settlement) date, the commission salesperson\nhas earned $950 in commissions. The employer pays the salesperson $450 ($950 -\n$500 previously paid by weekly draw). This commission salesperson has been paid\nin compliance with the monetary requirements of FLSA by being paid at least the\nMW for all hours of work during the pay (settlement) period.                                              \nb.     The\ncircumstances are the same as in a. above, but the employer only pays the\nsalesperson $170 at the end of the pay (settlement) period in order to bring\nthe individual up to the MW and carries the balance of $280 over, to be paid on\nthe next pay (settlement) period, thus crediting it toward the MW obligation\nfor that subsequent pay (settlement) period. This salesperson has also been\npaid in compliance with FLSA. Commissions earned but not paid on the next pay\n(settlement) date which are in excess of the amount required to satisfy MW\nrequirements may be carried forward and applied to the MW on subsequent pay\n(settlement) dates.                                              \nc.     The\ncircumstances are the same as in a. above, except that the salesperson has\nearned only $500 in commissions and is paid an additional $170 at the end of\nthe pay (settlement) period to meet the total MW ($3.35 x 200 - $670) due for\nthe hours worked during that month or pay period. At the end of the following\nmonth, the salesperson has earned $1,000 in commissions. The employer deducts\nfrom this amount the $170 that was paid the previous month to bring the\nemployee up to the MW. The employer pays the salesperson $670 ($3.35 x 200) and\ncarries the remaining $160 into the next month. This salesperson has also been\npaid in compliance with FLSA. If the employer pays an additional amount ($170\nthe first month) to satisfy the MW, this amount may be recovered from excess\ncommissions earned but not paid in subsequent pay (settlement) periods.\nSimilarly, commissions earned but not paid in a given pay (settlement) period\nwhich are in excess of the amount required to satisfy MW requirements may be\ncarried forward and applied to the MW on subsequent pay (settlement) dates.                                              \nd.     A\nsalesperson is paid four weekly draws of $150 each for a total of $600 for the\nmonthly pay (settlement) period. At the end of the month, the salesperson’s\ncommission earnings total $1,000. The employer deducts the $600 in draws from\nthis amount and pays the remainder (or excess) of $400 to the salesperson. The\nfollowing month, the salesperson is paid $600 in draws and earns no\ncommissions. To meet the MW obligation for the salesperson, the employer\napplies $70 from the $400 excess earned and paid the previous month. This practice\nis not in compliance with the requirements of FLSA. Any part of a commission\nthat is actually paid to the employee may not be carried forward as a credit\ninto subsequent pay (settlement) periods.                                              \ne.     Assume\nthe same 50-hour week and that the employer has definitely established a weekly\npay period and has a monthly settlement period. The salesperson draws $150 a\nweek against earned commissions. This salesperson has not been paid in\ncompliance with FLSA since this individual is not receiving the MW for all\nhours worked in the pay period (50 x $3.35 - $167.50). (Note: In example\n“e”, the pay period is one week; in example “a”, the pay period is one month.)",
