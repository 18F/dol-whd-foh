  "text": "An\nexempt employee’s earnings may be computed on an hourly, daily, or shift basis,\nwithout losing the exemption or violating the salary basis requirement, if the\nemployment arrangement also includes a guarantee of at least the minimum weekly\nrequired amount paid on a salary basis regardless of the number of hours, days,\nor shifts worked; and a reasonable relationship exists between the guaranteed\namount and the amount actually earned.  The reasonable relationship test will\nbe met if the weekly guarantee is roughly equivalent to the employee’s usual\nearnings at the assigned hourly, daily, or shift rate for the employee’s normal\nscheduled workweek, as the case may be.  Thus, for example, an exempt employee\nguaranteed compensation of at least $500 for any week in which the employee\nperforms any work, and who normally works four or five shifts each week, may be\npaid $150 per shift without violating the salary basis requirement (such an\nemployee must receive the full $500 guarantee in any week in which he or she\nworks three or fewer shifts). The reasonable relationship requirement applies\nonly to situations where the employee’s pay is computed on an hourly, daily or\nshift basis.  It does not apply, for example, to an exempt store manager paid a\nguaranteed salary of $650 per week who also receives a commission of one-half\npercent of all sales in the store or five percent of the store’s profits, which\nin some weeks may total as much as, or even more than, the guaranteed salary. \nThe actual facts under the employment arrangement must be scrutinized in each\ninstance to determine the predetermined amount that was actually guaranteed to\nbe paid “on a salary basis.” 29\nCFR § 541.604(b)",
