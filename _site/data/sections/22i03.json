  "text": "WHD\nhas found acquisition agents, relocation agents, and property management agents\nto be exempt as follows (see FOH 22i00): (a)  \nAcquisition Agents.  Acquisition\nAgents (AAs) are employed to perform various tasks relating to the acquisition\nof property for the employer’s clients. The AAs are responsible for purchasing\nthe property by negotiating with the property owners, analyzing property\nappraisals, and making recommendations to the client using real estate\npractices, legal concepts, governmental standards, and regulations. The AAs\nrepresent the client in negotiations with the property owners and attorneys.\nThey regularly recommend to the client whether a reasonable compromise is\nlikely and further negotiations should be pursued, or whether to pursue\ncondemnation litigation. If the property owner has a legitimate basis for\nseeking a substantially higher amount, the employees can recommend such\nincreases to the client. If the negotiation process fails, the AAs prepare the\nlawsuit packages for condemnation proceedings, assist the client’s attorney,\nand serve as an expert witness in mediation or trial. The AAs are also\nresponsible for preparing for the real estate closing, including preparing\nclosing documents.  When\nthe duties performed are those described above, the Acquisition Agents qualify\nfor the administrative exemption. The type of work performed by the AAs is\ndirectly related to the general business operations of the employer’s clients.\nAs noted in 29 CFR § 541.201(b), work in the functional areas of purchasing,\nprocurement, and legal and regulatory compliance qualifies as work that is\ndirectly related to management or general business operations. Additionally,\nthe many responsibilities of the AAs meet the discretion and independent\njudgment standard. The AAs interpret management policies, negotiate, consult\nwith and provide expert advice to management, and bind the client financially\non significant matters, as discussed in several of the factors found in 29 CFR\n§ 541.202(b). Furthermore, the AAs are similar to the insurance claims adjusters\nlisted as exempt in 29 CFR § 541.203, because they are responsible for\ninspecting and determining the value of property including unique real\nproperty, negotiating settlements, and making recommendations regarding\nlitigation when necessary.  (b)  \nRelocation Agents.  Relocation\nAgents (RAs) assist in property appraisal and provide relocation assistance to\nthe owners and tenants of the property purchased by the client. The RAs\nevaluate possible replacement properties and make recommendations as to the\namount of the “replacement housing payment” to be paid to the displaced\nproperty owner. The RAs conduct research and analyze the best options for the\nproperty owners. They also analyze possible alternative properties under\nfederal law. The RAs provide advice to the property owner on the moving process\nand any relocation assistance that might be available to them. The RAs can also\nmake recommendations to the client to offer additional payments to the property\nowner or to extend the occupancy period given to the displaced property owner.\nThey represent the client in appeals of the relocation payment amount, serving\nas expert witnesses in administrative appeals and/or in litigation. Where the\ntenant of the property is a business, the proceedings can be especially\ncomplicated because there often is tenant-installed equipment or machinery\nand/or significant build-outs by the tenant. In such cases, the relocation\nbenefits can be as much as a million dollars, and RAs have saved clients\nhundreds of thousands of dollars at a time in appeals of business relocation\npayments. The RAs also assist the property owner in preparations for the\nproperty closing.  When\nthe duties performed are those described above, the Relocation Agents qualify\nfor the administrative exemption. The type of work performed by the RAs is\ndirectly related to the general business operations of the employer’s clients.\nLike the AAs, the RAs work in the functional areas of procurement, government\nrelations, and legal and regulatory compliance, which are management and\ngeneral business operations functions. See 29 CFR § 541.201(a). The RAs\nexercise discretion and independent judgment as to significant matters by\nanalyzing housing alternatives, recommending “replacement housing payments,”\nand advising the client on significant financial matters. See 29 CFR\n§ 541.202(b). The RAs are also similar to the insurance claims adjusters\nlisted as exempt in 29 CFR § 541.203 because they are responsible for\ninspecting property, evaluating and making recommendations regarding the\n“replacement housing payment,” negotiating settlements with property owners,\nand representing management in any appeals.  (c)  \nProperty Management Agents.  The\nProperty Management Agents (PMAs) serve as spokespersons and representatives of\nthe client. They are responsible for dealing with governmental authorities,\nutility companies, contractors and other consultants during the conversion of\nthe property for public use. They are responsible for contacting and developing\nrapport with various local officials and explaining the project in order to\ndevelop good relationships and ensure compliance with the law. Additionally,\nthey must protect the client’s investment by working with the officials to keep\nthe property safe from possible vandals and by making police reports in the\nevent of vandalism. The PMAs work with environmental consultants to address\nenvironmental issues such as the presence of asbestos and to ensure compliance\nwith environmental protection laws. The PMAs coordinate all of their work and\ndevelop an Operations and Maintenance Plan to ensure that the consultants and\ncontractors follow proper procedures. The PMAs also coordinate and direct the\ndemolition of the property, including preparing detailed specifications prior\nto the bidding, advertising for bids, and conducting pre-bid meetings to explain\nthe project prior to accepting bids for the demolition work. They have\nauthority to use their knowledge and experience with contractors to select\npreferred contractors from an approved list or to shop for the best price for\nthe work. After selection, the PMAs oversee and evaluate the work of all\ncontractors. When\nthe duties performed are those described above, the Property Management Agents\nare exempt administrative employees. A PMA’s primary duty of serving as a\nliaison between the client and various government agencies qualifies as\nmanagement and general business operations because it involves government\nrelations and legal and regulatory compliance. In addition, their work during\nthe bid process and in the selection of contractors relates to purchasing and\nprocurement, and their oversight activities involve quality control. The PMAs\nimplement management policies, carry out major assignments, and negotiate on\nbehalf of the company on significant matters, thereby fulfilling the exercise\nof discretion and independent judgment requirement. See 29 CFR\n§ 541.202(b). WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2006-23",
