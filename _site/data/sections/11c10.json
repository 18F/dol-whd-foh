Thus, for example,\nemployees engaged in installing porcelain enamel paneling (such as is used on gasoline\nservice stations or store fronts) or in erecting prefabricated houses or other\nstructures are not thereby individually covered where the sole basis for such\ncoverage would be that the materials have been shipped from out-of-State. Of\ncourse, employees engaged at the construction site in receiving materials which\nare still moving interstate commerce would be individually covered under the\nAct. (See also FOH 11i04 and 11i05.)",
