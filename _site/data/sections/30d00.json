  "text": "(a)   Tipped\nemployees are subject to the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.  Section 3(m) of the\nFLSA permits an employer to claim a partial credit against its minimum wage\nobligation to a tipped employee based on tips received by the employee.  This\ncredit against wages due is called a “tip credit.”  29 CFR Part 531 contains\nfurther guidance on this topic. (b)   Section\n3(m) of FLSA makes clear the intent of Congress to place on the employer the\nburden of proving the amount of tips received by tipped employees and the\namount of tip credit, if any, which the employer may claim.  The employer may\nnot claim a tip credit greater than the tips received.  If the direct (or cash)\nwage paid plus the tips received is less than the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage,\nthe employer is required to pay the balance so that the employee receives at\nleast the minimum wage with the combination of wages and tips. (c)   The\nlanguage of Sec. 3(m) was amended by the Small Business Job Protection Act of\n1996.  Effective August 20, 1996, Sec. 3(m) provides: In determining the\nwage an employer is required to pay a tipped employee, the amount paid such\nemployee by the employee’s employer shall be an amount equal to – (1) the cash\nwage paid such employee which for purposes of such determination shall not be\nless than the cash wage required to be paid such an employee on August 20,\n1996; and (2) an additional amount on account of the tips received by such\nemployee which amount is equal to the difference between the wage specified in\nparagraph (1) and the wage in effect under section 206(a)(1) of this title. \nThe additional amount on account of tips may not exceed the value of the tips\nactually received by an employee.  The preceding two sentences shall not apply\nwith respect to any tipped employee unless such employee has been informed by\nthe employer of the provisions of this subsection, and all tips received by\nsuch employee have been retained by the employee, except that this subsection\nshall not be construed to prohibit the pooling of tips among employees who\ncustomarily and regularly receive tips. (d)   Tip\ncredit principles As amended in 1996, Sec. 3(m) limits the tip\ncredit an employer may claim to \"the difference between the wage specified\nin paragraph (1) and the wage in effect under section 206(a)(1).”  Thus, the\ntip credit is \"capped\" at the difference between the Sec. 6(a)(1)\nwage and the direct or cash wage paid.  The cash wage paid may not be less than\nthe cash wage required to be paid a tipped employee on August 20, 1996, which\nwas $2.13 per hour.   Because Sec. 3(m) limits the tip credit to the difference\nbetween the cash wage paid and the federal minimum wage, for purposes of the\nFLSA, employees who are paid using the tip credit are paid the minimum wage. 29 CFR 531.50(1)  Definition of\nTipped Employee A “tipped employee”,\nas defined in Sec. 3(t) of the FLSA, is any employee engaged in an occupation\nin which the individual customarily and regularly receives more than $30.00 a\nmonth in tips.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88) Although some states\ndefine “tipped employee” differently, the definition in Sec. 3(t) is used for\nFLSA enforcement purposes. Tip provisions apply\non an individual employee basis. An employer may claim the tip credit for some\nemployees even though the employer cannot meet the requirements for others. (Rev.\n563, 12/9/88) 29 CFR 531.50(b) (2)  Tips are the\nproperty of the employee A tip is a sum\npresented by a customer to the tipped employee as a gift or gratuity in\nrecognition of some service performed for him.  Section 3(m) sets forth the\nonly ways in which an employer can use its employee's tips: as a partial credit\nagainst its minimum wage obligations, or through a valid tip pool (defined in\nFOH 30d04).  These restrictions on an employer's use of its employees' tips\napply even when the employer has not taken a tip credit.   29 CFR 531.52 (3)  Notice\nrequirement An employer cannot take\na tip credit unless it informs the tipped employee of the provisions of Sec.\n3(m) and allows the tipped employee to retain all tips, except to the extent\nthe employee participates in a valid tip pooling arrangement.  Where an\nemployer does not inform the tipped employee of the use of the tip credit, the\nfull minimum wage is due, no tip credit will be allowed, and the employee must\nretain all tips received.  See FOH 30d01(c). 29 CFR 531.59(b)\nstates that the employer must inform its tipped employees, in advance of taking\nthe tip credit, of the following requirements in Section 3(m):                                              \na.     The\namount of the cash wage that is to be paid to the tipped employee by the\nemployer, which may not be less than $2.13 per hour,                                              \nb.     The\nadditional amount by which the wages of the tipped employee are increased on\naccount of the tip credit claimed by the employer,                                              \nc.     The\namount of the tip credit claimed may not exceed the value of the tips actually\nreceived by the employee,                                              \nd.     All\ntips received by the tipped employee must be retained by the employee except\nfor a valid tip pooling arrangement limited to employees who customarily and\nregularly receive tips,  and                                              \ne.     The\ntip credit shall not apply to any employee who has not been informed of these\nprovisions. (e)   Dual Jobs (1)  When an individual\nis employed in a tipped occupation and a non-tipped occupation – for example,\nas a server and janitor (dual jobs) -- the tip credit is available only for the\nhours spent in the tipped occupation, provided such employee customarily and\nregularly receives more than $30 a month in tips. (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)  29\nCFR 531.56(e). (2)  29 CFR\n531.56(e) permits the employer to take a tip credit for time spent in duties\nrelated to the tipped occupation of an employee, even though such duties are\nnot by themselves directed toward producing tips, provided such related duties\nare incidental to the regular duties of the tipped employees and are generally\nassigned to the tipped employee.  For example, duties related to the\ntipped occupation may include a server who does preparatory or closing\nactivities, rolls silverware and fills salt and pepper shakers while the\nrestaurant is open, cleans and sets tables, makes coffee, and occasionally\nwashes dishes or glasses.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88) (3)  However, where\nthe facts indicate that tipped employees spend a substantial amount of time (in\nexcess of 20 percent of the hours worked in the tipped occupation in the\nworkweek) performing such related duties, no tip credit may be taken for the\ntime spent in those duties.  All related duties count toward the 20\npercent tolerance.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88) (4)  Likewise, an\nemployer may not take a tip credit for the time that a tipped employee spends\non work that is not related to the tipped occupation.  For example,\nmaintenance work (e.g., cleaning bathrooms and washing windows) are not related\nto the tipped occupation of a server; such jobs are non-tipped\noccupations.  In this case, the employee is effectively employed in dual\njobs.",
