  "text": "(a)   If an employee performs work which can be clearly\nidentified and segregated under more than one job classification listed in the\napplicable WD, i.e., working in different capacities in the performance of the\ncontract, then the time spent by the employee in work properly related to each classification\nshould be segregated and paid according to the wage rate specified for each\nclassification. If the contractor cannot provide affirmative proof (employer\nrecords) of the hours spent in each class of work, then the contractor must pay\nthe employee the highest of such rates for all hours worked in the workweek.\n(See 29 C.F.R. 4.169.) (b)  Working in “different capacities” applies only to work\nin different job classifications (e.g., janitors and window cleaners as defined\nin the SCA Directory of Occupations), not to levels within the same job\nclassification (e.g., security guards I and II as defined in the SCA Directory\nof Occupations). Thus, for example, segregating work performed by an employee\nas security guard I and II would not be permitted. In such a situation, the\nemployee must be paid the highest rate listed in the WD for security guards\n(i.e., security guard II rate) for all hours worked in the workweek on the\ncovered contract.",
