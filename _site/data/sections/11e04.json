Those employees using the mails and other means of\ninterstate communication are engaged in commerce. (b)   If an employment agency merely screens and refers\napplicants to the usual miscellany of local customers, some of whom are engaged\nin the production of goods for commerce, the employees who handle the\nproducers’ accounts are not engaged in an occupation closely related and\ndirectly essential to the production of goods for commerce and thus are not\nindividually covered by the FLSA. (c)   However, if any employment agency engages in\nrecruitment or renders specialized services for producers of goods for\ncommerce, and thus acts as a substitute for the employment or personnel office\nof the producer, employees whose work is clearly connected with a particular\nemployer or industry or whose activities are specifically directed to meet the\nspecial personnel needs of producers are individually covered as engaged in an\noccupation closely related and directly essential to the production of goods\nfor commerce. In determining whether the activities of an employment agency are\ncloser to the substitute function than to the typical agency (b) above, the\nfollowing factors should be considered: (1)  Who pays the agency fees? (2)  Is there a continuing contractual relationship between\nthe employer and the agency? (3)  Is it a large scale recruitment program for particular\nproducers? (4)  Does the agency actually take part in the selection of\nemployees or does it merely refer an applicant to possible employers? (5)  Does the agency check references? (6)  Does the producer of goods also advertise and solicit\nhelp directly or does he depend primarily on the agency for his employment\nsupply? (7)  Are the efforts of the agency directed primarily to\nservicing the job applicant or the employer? Where\na determination cannot be made based upon the factors noted above, the matter\nshould be referred through channels to the RS for an opinion.",
