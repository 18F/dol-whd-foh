  "text": "Name: \nOccupations in or about Plants or Establishments Manufacturing or Storing\nExplosives or Articles Containing Explosive Components  Originally\nAdopted:  July 1, 1939 (a)  \nScope of HO 1 (1)  Workers in plants or establishments manufacturing or\nstoring explosives, including articles containing explosive components, are\nespecially subject to accident from explosions despite the progress made by\nmanufacturers and OSHA in developing safeguards.  The finding of the original\ninvestigation accompanying the report was that the accident severity rate for\nexplosive manufacturing was about twice as great as the average for all\nmanufacturing industries in 1936.  The injuries resulting from such explosions\nare often serious, resulting in fatalities or permanent injuries. (2)  This order deals with occupations in plants or\nestablishments engaged in manufacturing, handling, storing, and transporting of\nexplosives, articles containing explosive components, small arms ammunition,\nblasting caps and primers.  This includes fireworks (see FOH 33h01(a)(4)a\nfor the definitions of the terms explosives and articles\ncontaining explosive components). (3)  The order does not apply to the following: a.    \nRetail stores, including the\nstorage of ammunition in gun shops, sporting goods stores, building supplies\nand hardware stores; retail fireworks stands; and other retail establishments.  b.    \nGun clubs, trap and skeet ranges,\nturkey shoots, certain armories, police stations and other such areas where\nonly small arms ammunition is being stored.  c.    \nThe use of explosives in mining\noperations is covered by HOs 3 and 9.  The use of explosives in demolition and\nship-breaking work is covered by HO 15.  The use of explosives in excavation\nwork is covered by HO 17.  Storage of explosives at such sites, however, is\ncovered under HO 1.  (4)  Definitions a.    \nThe terms explosives and articles\ncontaining explosive components mean and include ammunition, black powder,\nblasting caps, fireworks, high explosives, primers, smokeless powder, and\nexplosives and explosive materials as defined in 18 U.S.C. 841(c)-(f) and the\nimplementing regulations at 27 CFR part 555.  The terms include any chemical\ncompound, mixture, or device, the primary or common purpose of which is to\nfunction by explosion, as well as all goods identified in the most recent list\nof explosive materials published by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms,\nand Explosives, Department of Justice.  This list is not intended to be\nall-inclusive and is updated and published annually in the Federal\nRegister pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 841(d).  A copy of the most recent\nversion of the list may be found through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\nFirearms, and Explosive’s Website located at www.atf.gov. b.    \nThe term plant or establishment\nmanufacturing or storing explosives or articles containing explosive components\nmeans the land with all the buildings and other structures thereon used in\nconnection with the manufacturing or processing or storing of explosives or\narticles containing explosive components.  Types of establishments which may\nstore these materials include ammunition depots, dynamite magazines, bunkers,\narmories, and fireworks warehouses. c.    \nThe term nonexplosives areas as\nused in the exception in HO 1 are those which meet all four criteria found in\n29 CFR 570.51(b)(3) and listed below (the criteria are such that ordinarily\nonly areas in large plants or establishments could qualify – a small fireworks plant\nor establishment would not ordinarily cover such a large area that it could\nsustain a “nonexplosives area”): 1.    \nNone of the work performed in the\narea involves the handling or use of explosives. 2.    \nThe area is separated from the\nexplosives area by a distance not less than that prescribed in the American\nTable of Distances for the protection of inhabited buildings.  The American\nTable of Distances, published by the Institute of Makers of Explosives, was\nlast revised in 1991.  The table lists “minimum safe distances” for the\nlocation of explosive storage and manufacturing buildings from inhabited\nbuildings, railways, highways, etc.  These distances vary with the type and\namount of explosive materials. 3.    \nThe area is separated from the\nexplosives area by a fence or is otherwise located so that it constitutes a\ndefinite designated area.  The phrase “or is otherwise located so that is\nconstitutes a definite designated area” was included to bring in any area which\nis located at a great distance from the explosives area, or is on the other\nside of a natural barricade at least comparable to a fence. 4.    \nSatisfactory controls have been\nestablished to prevent employees under 18 years of age within the area from\nentering any area in or about the plant that does not meet the above three\ncriteria.  The painting of a warning on the doors of all buildings containing\nexplosives advising minors under 18 years of age to stay out does not satisfy\nthis requirement.  Such warnings would have no actual restraining effect on\nemployees under 18 years of age and, by themselves, would not constitute a\nsatisfactory control within the intent of 29 CFR 570.51(b)(3). (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED.   Sixteen- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from\nperforming: (1)  All occupations in or about any plant or establishment\n(other than retail establishments and those establishments which manufacture or\nstore small-arms ammunition as described in FOH 33h01(b)(2) below); except 16-\nand 17-year-olds may perform work that does not involve the handling or use of explosives\nin qualifying “nonexplosives areas.” (2)  The following work in plants manufacturing or storing\nsmall-arms ammunition not exceeding .60 caliber in size, shotgun shells, or\nblasting caps when manufactured or stored in conjunction with the manufacture of\nsmall-arm ammunitions:  a.    \nAll occupations involved in the\nmanufacturing, mixing, transporting, or handling of explosive compounds in the\nmanufacture of small-arms ammunition and all other occupations requiring the\nperformance of any duties in the explosives area in which explosive compounds\nare manufactured or mixed. b.    \nAll occupations involved in the\nmanufacturing, transporting, or handling of primers and all other occupations\nrequiring the performance of any duties in the same building in which primers\nare manufactured. c.    \nAll occupations involved in the\npriming of cartridges and all other occupations requiring the performance of\nany duties in the same work room in which rim-fire cartridges are primed. d.    \nAll occupations involved in the\nplate loading of cartridges and in the operation of automatic loading machines. e.    \nAll occupations involved in the\nloading, inspecting, packing, shipping, and storage of blasting caps. (3)  The following work peculiar to the “fireworks”\nindustry. a.    \nHO 1 applies to homeworkers engaged\nin the manufacture of fireworks in their own homes.  Since explosives are\nstored in the home prior to and after assembly, a homeworker’s home would meet\nthe definition of a “plant or establishment manufacturing or storing\nexplosives.” b.    \nHO 1 applies to “shooters” who are\nhired by various civic organizations and governments to transport fireworks\nfrom the manufacturer or wholesaler to the display site, set up the fireworks\nat the site, load mortars (tubes from which the shells are fired), and fire\nshells.  Fireworks must be temporarily stored at the site prior to the\ndisplay.  The term “establishments storing explosives” in 29 CFR 570.51(b)(1)\nis sufficiently broad to cover these storage situations.   (4)  Work which involves the storage of ammunition and/or\nexplosives.  a.    \nHO 1 applies to any establishment,\nother than a retail establishment, which stores ammunition (other than\nsmall-arms ammunition not exceeding .60 caliber) or explosives, regardless of\nwhether or not manufacturing takes place at the facility.   b.    \nMinors 16 and 17 years of age,\nhowever, could work in a “nonexplosives area” of such an establishment or at an\nestablishment where only small-arms ammunition was stored.  Central warehouses\nused by retail stores, lacking the retail concept, would also be covered by HO\n1.  (c)  \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED (1)  HO 1 does not cover retail establishments selling\nexplosives or articles containing explosive components such as hardware stores,\nfireworks outlets, or building supply stores.  Individual storerooms, located\nat retail stores used to stock merchandise sold by that store, are also not\ncovered by HO 1 (see FOH 33h01(b)(4)b above concerning\nwarehouses). (2)  Work in plants manufacturing explosives, in plants\nstoring explosives, and in plants manufacturing articles containing explosive\ncomponents which does not involve the handling or use of explosives and which\nis performed in a “nonexplosives area.” (3)  All work in plants manufacturing or storing small-arms\nammunition (not exceeding .60 caliber) or blasting caps that is not\nspecifically prohibited by HO 1.  Examples include working as an inspector,\noffice work, machine operators (if not covered by HOs 5 or 8), packing (except\nblasting caps), shipping, and other work not involving the handling of explosives. (d)  \nExemptions There\nare no provisions in HO 1 for apprentices or student-learners.  There are no\nother exemptions applicable to this order.   (e)  \nEnforcement positions (1) \nGeophysical survey\ncrews a.    \nJug handlers (those\nwho help string the wire from the shooting hole to the recording equipment) in\ngeophysical surveys which involve the detonation of explosives in underground\nlocations are not subject to the prohibitions of HO 1. b.    \nThe overnight parking\nof trucks containing explosives used by the survey crews is not sufficient for\nthe trucks to be considered establishments storing explosives. (2)  Generally, no area in fireworks plants can meet the\n“non-explosive area” criteria of 29 CFR 570.51(b)(3).",
