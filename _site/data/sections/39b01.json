  "text": "(a)   Where two\nor more businesses exercise some control over the work or working conditions of\nthe employee, the businesses may be joint employers under the FMLA.  The\nrelationship is viewed in its totality in making a determination of whether or\nnot a joint employment relationship exists. (b)   A\nprofessional employer organization (PEO) that contracts with client employers\nto perform administrative functions does not enter into a joint relationship\nwith the employees of its                    client companies when it merely\nperforms administrative functions.  The determination of whether a PEO is a\njoint employer depends upon the economic realities of the situation and all the\nfacts and circumstances.  For example, if the PEO exercises control of the\nclient’s employees or benefits from the work that the employees perform, such\nfacts may indicate that the PEO would be a joint employer with the client\nemployer.  Where a PEO is a joint employer, the client employer is commonly the\nprimary employer. (c)   In joint\nemployment situations, only the primary employer is responsible for giving\nrequired notices to its employees, providing FMLA leave, and maintaining health\nbenefits. Factors considered in determining which is the primary employer\ninclude authority/responsibility to hire and fire, assign/place the employee,\nmake payroll, and provide employment benefits.  The primary employer is\nresponsible for job restoration and the secondary employer is responsible for\naccepting the employee returning from leave.  For example, if the joint\nemployment relationship is that of temporary/leased employee and the secondary\nemployer continued to use the agency to fill the position, the employee is\nentitled to return to the position he or she held with the secondary employer. \nIf the secondary employer did not fill the position from that agency, then the\nprimary employer must place the employee in an equivalent position. 29 CFR 825.106WHD Opinion Letter\nFMLA 2004-1-A",
