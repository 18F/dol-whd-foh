The assembling of a plow or other\nsuch farm implement which has been cut to measurements and for which all the\nparts have been manufactured to fit together is no different than the work of a\ndealer assembling a “knocked down” bicycle, and is not the work of a mechanic\nwithin the meaning of Sec 13(b)(10).",
