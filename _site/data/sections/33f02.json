  "text": "[Rev. 599, 12/28/93] (a)  \nThe minimum age is 16 for\nemployment in agriculture during school hours unless:  (1)  The minor is employed exclusively by his or her parent\nor by a person standing in the place of his or her parent.  (2)  The minor has completed his or her high school course.\n (3)  The minor is below the eligible entrance age in the\nstate. In states where there is no written eligible age, the compulsory age\nbecomes the eligible age.  (4)  The school, which the minor normally attends or would\nnormally attend in the district where he or she is living, is closed for crop\nvacation or any other reason. In some communities, one school may close for\ncrop vacation while others in the same community remain in session.  The Inv\nwill need to find out which public or parochial school the minor attends and in\nthe case of the migrant minor, which public school he or she would normally\nattend.  (5)  The school, due to crowded conditions, is operating on\na split shift basis.  Under this plan the school day is divided into half-day\nsessions.  Some children attend classes in the morning and others in the\nafternoon.  The children under these circumstances could be legally employed in\nagriculture the half-day they are not required to attend school.  (6)  The administrative unit, such as the high school or\njunior high school which the minor attends, is closed. The exemption makes no\nprovision for the release of individual children or any class or grade to work\nin agriculture.  (b)  \nMinors below 16 years of age may\nnot be employed in AG H.O.s except where employed by a parent or person\nstanding in the place of a parent on a farm owned or operated by the parent or\nperson standing in place thereof (see FOH 33f03). Thus, the\nemployment during school hours of minors under 16 years of age under the\nconditions set forth in FOH 33f02(a)(2) through (6) above is permitted only\nwhere the minor does not engage in such hazardous work.",
