  "text": "(a)  \n29 CFR 570.33(e) generally\nprohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from occupations which involve the operating,\ntending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing of any\npower-driven machinery other than office machines.  Exceptions to this general\nprohibition are also provided for certain food service related equipment as per\n29 CFR 570.34(c) and certain work in connection with cars and trucks as per\n29 CFR 570.34(n).   (b)  \nThe term power-driven machinery as\nused by CL Reg 3 is very broad, and includes machines driven by electrical,\nmechanical, water, or other power such as steam or hydraulic.  It also includes\nbattery-operated machines and tools but does not apply to machines or tools\ndriven exclusively by hand or foot power (see 75 FR 28408).   (c)  \nTo emphasize the fact that CL Reg\n3 prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from operating and tending almost all\npower-driven equipment, § 570.33(e) lists particular pieces of equipment that\nhave historically been the source of child labor violations.  This list is\ndesigned to provide clarity and is not exhaustive. (d)  \nTending of power-driven machinery\nis also interpreted broadly under CL Reg 3 and generally encompasses all\nactivities associated with the operation of such machinery, including but not\nlimited to:  (1)  Setting up, adjusting, cleaning, fueling, oiling,\nmaintaining, inspecting, transporting, and repairing such machinery.  (2)  Loading materials into the machinery and removing\nmaterials from the machinery.   (3)  Monitoring of machinery to ensure that it is operating\nproperly.   (4)  Individuals who assist the operators of machinery—in\nsuch matters as ensuring that there is a clear path of movement for the\nmachine, ensuring that the load the machine is carrying or transporting is\nproperly balanced or distributed, providing direction for the placement of a\nload (as in the case of a forklift), and providing physical or verbal\nassistance in the steering of machinery—would all be performing tending activities\nunder CL Reg 3.   (5)  Tending includes assisting passengers on and off such\npower-driven machinery as a ski lift, an amusement park ride, or a slide at a\nwater park (when water is pumped to the top of the slide).   (e)  \nThe following are WH enforcement\npositions relating to the operation and/or tending of certain pieces of\npower-machinery.  A discussion regarding power-driven kitchen equipment and\nfood processing equipment is contained in FOH 33c12. (1) \nVacuum\ncleaners and floor waxers.  In addition to certain office machines (see\nFOH 33d01) and kitchen equipment (see FOH 33c12), CL Reg\n3 permits 14- and 15-year-olds to operate vacuum cleaners and floor waxers (see\n29 CFR 570.34(h)).   a.    \nThe term floor waxers refers to\nthose combination or multipurpose floor care machines designed to strip wax\nfrom floors, reapply wax, and buff or polish floors.  Such machines, also\ncalled buffers, burnishers, and polishers, consist of a motor housed above a\ncircular rotating horizontal surface to which various pads or brushes may be\nattached, depending upon the task to be performed.  The operator directs the\nmovement of the machine using a handle that rises perpendicular to the base of\nthe machine. b.    \nThe term floor waxers does not\ninclude the above described machines when used to sand or refinish floors, as\nsuch equipment would generally be prohibited under HO 5 (Occupations involved\nin the operation of power-driven wood-working machines).  In addition, CL Reg 3\nprohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in processing and construction\noccupations. c.    \nThe term floor waxers does not\ninclude any floor stripper, cleaner, scrubber, burnisher or polisher upon which\nthe operator may ride while operating the machine. (2)  Power-driven mowers.  29 CFR 570.33(e) prohibits the\nemployment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations involving the operating or\ntending of power-driven machinery, and specifically names lawn mowers. \nFurthermore, Hazardous Occupations Order 2 (HO 2) would prohibit anyone under\nthe age of 18 from operating a riding lawn mower when used as a means of\ntransportation on public roads or highways (see FOH 33h02(e)(3)). (3) \nCutters,\nincluding weed trimmers and “weed eaters”.  The prohibitions of 29 CFR\n570.33(e) include operating or tending power-driven “cutters” such as weed\ntrimmers, “weed eaters,” and hedge trimmers. (4)  Golf carts and all terrain vehicles (ATVs).  29 CFR\n570.33(e) prohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from operating or tending\npower-driven machinery, including golf carts and ATVs. \n29 CFR 570.33(f) prohibits these same minors from being employed in\noccupations involving the operation of motor vehicles.  As golf carts and ATV’s\nare power-driven machines that are also motor vehicles, no one under 16 years\nof age may operate or tend such machines. a.    \nThese CL Reg 3 prohibitions are\nmuch broader than those of HO 2.  The CL Reg 3 prohibitions are not restricted\nto the operation of the motor vehicle on “public roads or highways.”   b.    \nThe operation of a golf cart or an\nATV would also be prohibited under HO 2 if the minor were operating the vehicle\nas a means of transportation on a public road or highway (see FOH\n33e02c(2)(b)). (5) \n“Cart\nCaddy” and “QuicKART”.  29 CFR 507.33(e) prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from\noperating or tending power-driven machinery.  This would include the “Cart\nCaddy,” “QuicKART,” and similar pieces of equipment. a.    \nThe “Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART”\nare two types of power-driven machines often used by grocers and other retail\nstores to move large strings of shopping carts.  These machines are hooked to\nthe last shopping cart in a string and then the operator guides the string of\ncarts back to the store while commanding the machine to move by means of a\nhand-held remote control.  The operator walks behind the machine and operates\nthe manual throttle when returning to the parking lot to collect more carts.   b.    \nAs these machines are not\nconsidered to be “motor vehicles” as defined in HO 2, they do not fall within\nthe scope of HO 2.  Sixteen- and 17-year-old minors are permitted to operate\nthese machines (see FOH 33h02(e)(2)). (6) \nOffice\nmachines.  29 CFR 570.33(e) and 570.34(a) permit 14- and 15-year-old minors to\noperate office machines.  Office machines that may be operated by 14- and\n15-year-old minors include computers, typewriters, electric staplers, printers,\ncopiers, cash registers, pencil sharpeners, automatic letter openers, adding\nmachines and calculators, postage machines, automatic filing systems, VCRs, and\ndigital cameras.   (7)  Paper shredders.  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may\noperate “office type” paper shredders in an office setting as part of “office\nwork.”  CL Reg 3 prohibits such youth from operating paper shredders in an\nindustrial or recycling setting.  (8) \nAmusement\npark and water park rides.  The CL Reg 3 general prohibition against the\noperation and tending of power-driven machinery includes the operating or\ntending of all power-driven amusement park and water amusement park rides.   a.    \nTending\nwould include such duties as assisting riders as they enter and leave the ride,\nchecking to ensure seat belts are properly fastened, and policing the area to\nensure the ride is operated safely. b.    \nThese\nprohibitions extend to most power-driven rides and attractions at water parks\nas well.  29 CFR 570.34(l)(1) specifically prohibits all minors under 16 years\nof age from working as dispatchers at the top of elevated water slides (see\nFOH 33d06(d)(2)).  Note that certain activities may be performed by\nproperly certified 15 year old lifeguards at traditional swimming pools and\nwater amusement parks (including such water park facilities as wave pools, lazy\nrivers, specialized activity areas that may include water falls and sprinkler\nareas, and at the receiving or splashdown areas of the elevated water slides\n(see 29 CFR 570.34(l)(1); see also  FOH  33d06). WHD\nFLSA Non-Administrator Letter January 17, 2006 c.    \nIn addition, 29 CFR 570.33(f)\nprohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from operating a motor vehicle or serving\nas helpers on such vehicles.  Some amusement park rides or equipment, such as\ngo-carts, coaches, and equipment used in daily parades, meet the definition of\nmotor vehicles (for purposes of Reg. 3, WHD uses the definition of motor\nvehicle from HO 2, 29 CFR 570.52(c)(1)).   d.    \n29 CFR 570.33(n)(1) prohibits 14-\nand 15-year-olds from performing occupations in connection with the\ntransportation of persons or property by rail, highway, air, water, pipeline or\nother means.  Some amusement park rides, such as boats, paddle boats, “swan\nrides,” ferries, and railroads, fall within this prohibition. e.    \nThe operation of amusement park\nrides is not prohibited for 16- and 17-year-old minors under Hazardous\nOccupations Order 7 (HO 7).  Although a number of rides in amusement and theme\nparks have characteristics similar to certain machines that minors are\nprohibited from operating under HO 7, they are not derricks,\ncranes, hoists, elevators, or manlifts\nas defined by the HO (see FOH 33h07(c)). (9) \nConveyors.  See FOH\n33c17. (10) \nAutomatic\nelevators.  CL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from operating “automatic”\nfreight elevators and automatic combined passenger/freight elevators.  Such\nyouth may operate and ride in fully automatic passenger elevators as found in\nmost office buildings.  See FOH 33h07.",
