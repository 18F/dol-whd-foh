  "text": "(a)           \nIn some cases a special duty nurse or “sitter” may be employed to\ncare for a patient in a hospital or nursing home. Whether the employee is employed\nby the patient or by the hospital or nursing home is a question of fact. For\nexample, if the hospital or nursing home determines whether use of a special\nduty nurse or “sitter” will be permitted, what the pay is to be (even though\npaid directly by the patient), and decides which special duty nurse or “sitter”\nwill be assigned to a particular patient, the hospital or nursing home is\nconsidered to be the employer. (b)           \nOn the other hand, if the patient or their representative\ncontracts directly with the special duty nurse or “sitter” as to pay, hours of\nwork and other working conditions, and the establishment does not control or\nsupervise such work, an employment relationship does not exist between the\nspecial duty nurse or “sitter” and the establishment. This same principle will\napply to a nurse or other employee on the hospital or nursing home staff who is\nemployed during her off-duty hours as a special duty nurse or “sitter” by a\npatient in the establishment. During the period or periods in which the employee\nis so engaged on this special duty by the patient, WH will consider the\nemployment relationship as with the patient and not with the hospital or\nnursing home. (c)           \nA special duty nurse or “sitter” who is employed by the patient\nto care for such patient in a hospital or nursing home, as described in (b)\nabove, is not employed “in connection with the operation of” the hospital or\nnursing home (see Sec 3(r)). The employment is in the nursing home or hospital\nonly because the patient is there and the work is not connected “with the\noperation of” the hospital or nursing home as such.",
