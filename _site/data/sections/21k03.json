  "text": "(a)   A question has been raised concerning the\napplicability to employees of a country club’s dining room of the Sec 13(b)(8)\nexemption for “any employee employed by an establishment which is a . . .\nrestaurant”. Wage-Hour will consider this exemption applicable to employees of\na private club who are engaged in preparing or serving food or beverages on its\npremises to its members and guests. Typical of the employees within the\nexemption are cooks and kitchen service employees, bus boys, waiter and\nwaitresses, bartenders, snack bar attendants, and other similar employees\nengaged in the preparation and serving of food or beverages on club premises.\nIn other words, the employees engaged in a club’s food and beverage service\ncould qualify as employees “employed by an establishment which is a restaurant”\neven though their work may take them into other areas of the club premises.\nThus, the food and beverage employees may provide service, for example, to\nmembers and guest at poolside, in the locker rooms, on terraces, on the lawn,\nin cardrooms or in other recreation areas without loss of the exemption. (b)  As described in (a) above, our position that these\nexemptions will be considered to apply to the club’s food and beverage service\nemployees has the effect of a general determination, applicable only to such\nclub’s food and beverage service employees has the effect of a general\ndetermination, applicable only to such clubs, that the employees described will\nbe considered to qualify under Sec 13(b)(8) as “employed by an establishment\nwhich is a . . .  restaurant”. This means that we will not, in individual\ncases, question whether they are “employed by” an identifiable separate establishment\non the premises which is a “restaurant”. The exemption does not apply to other\nservice employees, such as those who maintain the tennis courts, the swimming\npool, or who attend to the general running of the club even though such\nemployees may work in the same areas as the food and beverage service\nemployees. (c)   The term “private clubs” as used in (a) and (b) above\nrefers to private clubs where membership requirements disqualify them for the\nSec 13(a)(2) exemption, but which offer to members and guest a meal service of\nthe kind provided by restaurants. Examples of clubs which may have such\nmembership restrictions and may offer such restaurant service to members and\nguests are country, town, swimming pool, tennis, golf, ski, and beach clubs,\nand lodges of fraternal orders.",
