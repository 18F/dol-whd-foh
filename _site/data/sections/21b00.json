  "text": "A concession such as\none in a ball park which supplies its stands and hawkers with hot dogs,\npopcorn, and the like from one central commissary is a single establishment for\nthe purposes of the retail and service establishment exemptions. The business\npossesses unity of ownership, unity of operations, unity of functions, and\nthough broken into units known as stands, is consolidated and operated as an integrated\nunit. The stands and the vendors do not have independent characters of their\nown as establishments, for they are on a temporary relationship to the\ncommissary and fulfill the functions of departments for an establishment. Only\ntogether with the commissary can they constitute a definable establishment.\nThus, unlike a commissary serving a chain of retail stands operated in a\ntransportation terminal or similar area, the concession commissary does not in\nessence perform a warehouse function for a group of establishments within the\nmeaning of the FLSA, but is rather fundamentally a necessary complement to an\nintegrated retail establishment. This business operates on the same premises of\nthe ball park stadium, and no other establishments separate the parts of the\nbusiness.",
