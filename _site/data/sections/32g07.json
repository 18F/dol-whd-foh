  "text": "(a)  \nWhere it is found that a\nguaranteed weekly wage plan does not meet the requirements of FLSA Sec 7(f)\nduring a particular period of time for a particular employee, a violation will\nexist for that employee and the total amount of his guaranteed wage as\nspecified in the contract or agreement determines his regular rate of pay\nduring the period of violation. In any week in the violation period for which\nit is necessary to compute his regular rate of pay for OT purposes, the rate\nshall be determined as follows: (1)  In workweeks not exceeding the guaranteed number of\nhours, the total amount of the guaranty shall be divided by the number of hours\nactually worked. (2)  In workweeks exceeding the number of hours covered by\nthe guaranty, the guaranteed salary shall be divided by the guaranteed number\nof hours. Compensation received by the employee for work in excess of the\nguaranty may, of course, be offset against the amount found due by computing\nhis earnings on the regular rate of pay calculated as explained above. (b)  \nIllustration: A\nSec 7(f) plan has been determined to be invalid for a particular employee. The\nrate specified in the contract or agreement is $4.00 per hour and a guaranty of\n$220.00 to cover ST and OT compensation for 50 hours is provided. No bonuses or\nother additions to wages are paid to the employee. (1)  In a week in which he worked 45 hours the employee’s\nregular rate of pay would be $220.00 divided by 45 hours, or $4.88. In addition\nto the $220.00 already paid to him under his guaranty, he would be entitled to\nreceive half-time for the five OT hours, or $12.20. (2)  In a week in which the employee worked 50 hours, the\nnumber of hours for which pay was guaranteed, his regular rate would be $220.00\ndivided by 50 hours, or $4.40. He would be entitled to receive an additional\n$22.00 for the 10 OT hours. (3)  In a week in which the employee worked 55 hours and\nreceived under his contract or agreement the total amount of $250.00 ($220.00\nunder his guaranty and $20.00 as ST pay and $10.00 as OT premium for the five\nadditional hours) his regular rate of pay would still be determined by dividing\nthe amount of his guaranty, $220.00 by the number of hours for which pay was\nguaranteed, 50 hours. His regular rate for that week would thus again be $4.40\nand total compensation due would be ($220.00 + $22.00) + (5 X 1-1/2 X $4.40) or\n$275.00. BW due would be $275.00 - $250.00 or $25.00. (c)  \nThe illustrations in (b) above\nmerely state the principle involved. The actual computation should be made by\nuse of the coefficient table as appropriate. (See “Transcription and\nComputation Short Cuts for Overtime”.)",
