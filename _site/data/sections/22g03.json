the time period during which the employer made improper\ndeductions; the number and geographic location of employees whose salary was\nimproperly reduced; the number and geographic location of managers responsible\nfor taking the improper deductions; and whether the employer has a clearly\ncommunicated policy permitting or prohibiting improper deductions.  29\nCFR § 541.603(a)  (b)  \nIf the facts demonstrate that the employer has an actual\npractice of making improper deductions, the exemption is lost during the time\nperiod in which the improper deductions were made for employees in the same job\nclassification working for the same managers responsible for the actual\nimproper deductions.  Employees in different job classifications or who work\nfor different managers do not lose their exempt status.  For example, if a\nmanager at a company facility routinely docks the pay of engineers at that\nfacility for partial-day personal absences, then all engineers at that facility\nwhose pay could have been improperly docked by that manager would lose the\nexemption; engineers at other facilities or working for other managers,\nhowever, would remain exempt.   29\nCFR § 541.603(b)  (c)  \nIsolated or inadvertent improper deductions will not result\nin loss of the exemption for any employees if the employer reimburses the\nemployees for the improper deductions.  Whether deductions are “isolated” is\ndetermined according to an analysis of the factors in 29 CFR § 541.603(a). \n“Inadvertent” deductions are those taken unintentionally, for example, as a\nresult of a clerical or time-keeping error. 29\nCFR § 541.603(c) 69\nFR 22181 (d)  \nSafe harbor. (1)  29 CFR § 541.603(d)\nprovides a safe harbor for employers that have a clearly communicated policy\nprohibiting improper deductions.  If an employer has such a clearly\ncommunicated policy that prohibits the improper pay deductions specified in 29 CFR\n§ 541.602(a), includes a mechanism for employees to file complaints, reimburses\nemployees for any improper deductions and makes a good faith commitment to\ncomply with the salary basis rule in the future, the employer will not lose the\nexemption for any employees unless the employer willfully violates the policy\nby continuing to make improper deductions after receiving employee complaints. \nFailure to reimburse employees for any improper deductions or continuing to\nmake improper deductions after receiving employee complaints will cause the\nexemption to be lost during the time period in which the improper deductions\nwere made for employees in the same job classification working for the same\nmanagers responsible for the actual improper deductions. (2)  Although a\nwritten policy is the best evidence of the employer’s good faith efforts to\ncomply with the salary basis rule under 29 CFR part 541, a written policy is\nnot essential.  However, the policy must have been “clearly communicated” to\nemployees prior to the actual impermissible deduction.  The “clearly\ncommunicated” standard can be met, for example, by providing a copy of the\npolicy to employees when they are hired, publishing it in an employee handbook\nor distributing it to employees over the employer’s Intranet. (3)  The safe harbor\nprovision is available regardless of the reason for the improper deduction,\nwhether made for lack of work or for reasons other than lack of work.  For\nexample, where an employer has a clearly communicated policy prohibiting\nimproper deductions but a manager engages in an actual practice (neither\nisolated nor inadvertent) of making improper deductions, regardless of the\nreasons for the deductions, the exemption would not be lost for any employees\nif, after receiving and investigating an employee complaint, the employer\nreimburses the employees for the improper deductions and makes a good faith\ncommitment to comply in the future.  There are several ways in which an\nemployer could show its “good faith commitment” to comply in the future\nincluding (but not limited to) adopting or re-publishing to employees its\npolicy prohibiting improper pay deductions; posting a notice including such a\ncommitment on an employee bulletin board or the employer’s Intranet; providing\ntraining to managers and supervisors on the employer’s policy and commitment;\nreprimanding or training the manager who took the improper deduction(s); or\nestablishing a telephone number for employees to file complaints concerning\nimproper deductions. 69 FR 22181 through 22182 (4)  An employer\nshould be allowed a reasonable amount of time to look into and correct a matter\nafter receiving an employee complaint of improper deductions.  While the amount\nof time it will take an employer to complete an investigation will depend upon\nthe particular circumstances, an employer should begin such an investigation\npromptly.  However, the mere fact that the employer receives other employee complaints\nbefore timely completion of the investigation should not, by itself, defeat the\nsafe harbor.  69 FR 22183",
