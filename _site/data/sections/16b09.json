  "text": "Part 531.39(b) states, “[w]hen\nthe payment to a third person of monies withheld pursuant to a court order\nunder which the withholding exceeds that permitted by the CCPA, the excess will\nnot be considered equivalent to payment of wages to the employee for purpose of\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act.” Therefore, amounts withheld by the employer from\nan employee’s earnings under a garnishment order in excess of the withholdings\nallowed by sec 303 of the CCPA are not wages pursuant to sec 3(m) of the FLSA.\nAccordingly, where such excess withholdings decrease wages below the\ncompensation due under the FLSA a violation of that Act exists. This is not\naltered by the fact that such excess withholdings are for the benefit of the\nemployee, paid to a third person and the employer derives no profit or benefit\nfrom the transaction.  16bl0 - Draw against commission. The definition of “earnings”\nin sec 302(a) of the Act includes, “compensation paid or payable … whether\ndenominated as wages, salary, commission, ...” WH considers a draw against\ncommission to be earnings. As such, the draw is subject to the restrictions of\nsec 303(a), in the same manner as other forms of compensation. For example, for a period of\n8 weeks an employee receives disposable earnings in the amount of $150.00 a\nweek, as a draw against commission. The employer may make no deduction pursuant\nto a consumer debt garnishment during the 8 weeks, because only disposable earnings\nin excess of $154.50 may be withheld. At the end of the 8-week period, the employee\nreceives $6,000.00 settling the remainder of commissions earned. After\nsubtracting the deductions required by law from this $6,000.00, 25% is\navailable for garnishment. The $1200.00 drawn during the first 8 weeks of this\nperiod is not included in the total subject to garnishment. These wages\nconstitute the earnings subject to capture in each week of the eight week\nperiod. (See FOH 16b00.)",
