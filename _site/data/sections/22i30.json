An LPM’s typical\nwork day consists of performing office or non-manual work. Therefore, the LPM’s\nprimary duty involves the “performance of office or non-manual work directly related\nto the management or general business operations of the employer.”  A\ntypical LPM’s primary duty “includes the exercise of discretion and independent\njudgment with respect to matters of significance.” An LPM who is working\nindependently has certain decision-making authority that is “free from\nimmediate direction or supervision.”  When selecting appropriate steps to\naddress the problem of inventory shortage and pursuing the selected course of\naction, an LPM compares and evaluates possible courses of conduct, and acts or\nmakes a decision after the various possibilities have been considered as\ndiscussed in 29 CFR § 541.202(a). The LPM’s primary duty of implementing the\nloss prevention and shortage control program for a store, and supervisory work\nwhere an LPM is in charge of subordinates, demonstrates that the employee\n“implement[s] management policies or operating practices.”  When implementing\nthe loss prevention and shortage control program for the store, the LPM\n“performs work that affects business operations to a substantial degree”\nbecause the effective performance of such duty is essential for the\nprofitability of the store and, in fact, frequently determines the store’s\nsuccess or failure. When developing store-specific programs to meet or exceed the\nstore’s shortage goals, the LPM “carries out major assignments in conducting\nthe operations of the business.”  In determining what internal investigations\nto pursue and when to conduct interviews, in ascertaining prosecutable cases,\nand in investigating harassment allegations, the LPM “investigates and resolves\nmatters of significance on behalf of management.”  In addition, in consulting\nwith and providing expert advice to store management with respect to the loss\nprevention and shortage control program, the LPM “provides consultation or\nexpert advice to management.”  Therefore, the LPM’s duties meet several of the\nfactors in 29 CFR § 541.202(b) indicating the sufficient “exercise of\ndiscretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance”\nand, as such, may qualify for the administrative exemption.
