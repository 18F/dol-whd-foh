  "text": "(a)   The SCA WD sets forth the MWs and FBs that contractors\nand their subcontractors must pay service employees working on covered\ncontracts. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.3(a).) (1) \nWages are defined as monetary\ncompensation provided to employees. They are usually listed in the WD as hourly\nrates. (2) \nThe FBs specified in the WD depend\nupon the type of WD issued and the evaluation of source data used to develop\nthe WD.  (b)  Most WDs are revised periodically, as new wage and\nbenefit survey data become available. If a WD is properly included in the\ncontract at the time of award, the contract does not need to be modified to\ninclude subsequent revisions to the WD prior to completion of the first year of\nthe contract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.5(a)(2).) (c)   Section 10 of the Act requires a WD to be made by WH\nfor every covered service contract in excess of $2,500 and employing six or\nmore service employees. If five or fewer service employees are employed under a\ncontract, the contracting agency should obtain a WD, and if one is available,\nincorporate it into the contract. WH is not required by the Act to issue a WD\nfor covered contracts that exceed $2,500 with five or fewer service employees,\nbut the contracting agency should still seek to obtain one. In instances where\nno WD has been issued for a service contract involving five or fewer service\nemployees, the contractor can pay no less than the MW required by Section\n6(a)(1) of the FLSA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.2, 4.3(a), 4.4(b)(1).) (d)  Two Bases on which SCA WDs are issued: (1) \nPrevailing in the locality WDs set\nforth MWs and FBs determined to be prevailing for various classes of service\nemployees in the locality of the service contract after giving “due\nconsideration” to the rates applicable to such service employees if directly\nhired by the Government. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.51.)                                              \na.     Rates are usually based on data collected by the BLS\nunder the National Compensation and Occupational Employment Statistics Surveys;\nor                                             \nb.     Rates may be based on union dominance where a single\nrate is paid to a majority (50 percent or more) of workers in a class of\nservice employees engaged in similar work in a particular locality. (See 29\nC.F.R. 4.51(b).) (2) \nSection 4(c), or “successorship”,\nWDs set forth the wages and benefits, including accrued and prospective\nincreases, contained in CBAs reached as a result of arm’s-length negotiations\nthat were applicable to service employees employed on predecessor contracts in\nthe same locality. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163.)                                              \na.     For Section 4(c) to be applicable, the predecessor\ncontract must involve substantially the same services being provided in the\nsame locality. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(i).)                                             \nb.     The successor contractor is obligated to pay its\nservice employees the CBA rates whether or not the employees of the predecessor\ncontractor are hired by the successor contractor. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(a).)                                              \nc.     The provisions of Section 4(c) are self-executing and\nfailure to include the CBA rates in the WD issued for the successor contract\ndoes not relieve a successor contractor of the statutory requirements to comply\nwith the CBA rates. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(b).)                                             \nd.     Any interpretation of the wage and FB provisions of\nthe CBA where its provisions are unclear must be based on the intent of the\nparties to the CBA provided that such interpretation is not violative of law.\n(See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(j).)                                              \ne.     The obligation of the successor contractor is limited\nto the wage and benefit requirements of the predecessor contractor’s CBA and\ndoes not extend to other items such as seniority, grievance procedures, work\nrules, overtime, etc. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(a).)                                              \nf.     The successor contractor may satisfy the FB provisions\nof the CBA by furnishing any equivalent combination of benefits or by making\nequivalent or differential payments in cash in accordance with 29 C.F.R. 4.177.\n(See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(j).)                                              \ng.     Application of Section 4(c) is not negated because the\ncontracting authority may change and the successor contract is awarded by a\ndifferent contracting agency. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(g).)                                             \nh.     The successorship provisions of Section 4(c) apply to\nfull term successor contracts. “Bridge” or short-term interim contracts due to\nbid protest, default by the predecessor contractor, temporary closing of\nfacility, etc., are not predecessor contracts for Section 4(c) purposes and do\nnot negate the application of Section 4(c)’s successorship provisions to the\nfull term contract awarded after the temporary interruption or hiatus.\nContractors are required to pay the predecessor contractor’s CBA rates during\nshort-term interim contracts. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(h).)                                               \ni.     Under Section 4(c), the predecessor contractor’s\nexisting CBA provides the basis for the WD applicable to the successor\ncontract. If the CBA is no longer binding on the parties, e.g., as a result of\nunion decertification or a legitimate impasse recognized by the National Labor\nRelations Act, the successorship requirements of Section 4(c) would be broken.\nThe CBA rates would not apply to the successor contract, but would continue to\napply throughout the contract period during which the decertification or\nimpasse was reached.                                                \nj.     Pursuant to Section 4(b) of the SCA, a variation limits\nthe self-executing application of Section 4(c) for new and changed CBAs entered\ninto by the incumbent contractor such that a new or changed CBA is not\neffective for successorship purposes if: (1) in the case of a successor\ncontract for which bids have been invited by formal advertising, notice of the\nterms of the new or changed CBA is received by the contracting agency less than\n10 days before the date set for bid opening (provided that the contracting\nagency finds that there is not reasonable time still available to notify\nbidders), or (2) for awards of successor contracts to be entered into pursuant\nto negotiations or resulting from execution of a renewal option or extension,\nnotice of the terms of the new or changed CBA is received by the contracting\nagency after the award of the successor contract, and the start of contract performance\nis within 30 days of the award, renewal option, or extension (however, if the\ncontract does not specify a start of performance date within 30 days from the\naward, and/or performance of such procurement does not begin within this 30-day\nperiod, any notice of the terms of the new or changed CBA received by the\ncontracting agency not less than 10 days before commencement of the contract\nwill be effective for purposes of the successor contract under Section 4(c)). This\nvariation will apply only if the contracting agency has given both the\nincumbent contractor and its employees’ collective bargaining representative\nwritten notification at least 30 days in advance of applicable estimated\nprocurement dates. Estimated procurement dates include bid solicitation, bid\nopening, date of award, commencement of negotiations, receipt of proposals, or\nthe commencement date of a contract resulting from a negotiation, option, or\nextension, as the case may be. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.1b(b).)                                             \nk.     There are two types of appeals that can be made\nconcerning collectively bargained rates where Section 4(c) applies -- based on\nsubstantial variance issues, or based on issues concerning arm’s-length\nnegotiations. Both types of appeals are resolved based on administrative proceedings\nhandled by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Part 6, and/or\nthe Administrative Review Board (ARB) pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Part 8. (See 29\nC.F.R. 4.10, 4.11, 4.163(c).)",
