  "text": "(a)   The provisions of Part I of the Interstate\nCommerce Act apply only to common carriers engaged in interstate commerce in\nthe transportation of passengers or property wholly by railroad, or partly by\nrailroad and partly by water when both are under common control, management, or\narrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment. Employers in this category\ninclude railroad carriers, express companies, sleeping car companies, and\nrefrigerator car companies. (Prior to 5/1/74, the exemption also applied to\nemployees of common carriers engaged in interstate commerce by pipeline (except\ncarriers of water or of natural or artificial gas).) (b)   In the foregoing paragraph, the words\n“common control, management, or arrangement” may include a common understanding\nbetween carriers as to traffic policy, even though the separate corporate\nentities of the carriers may be maintained.  For example, a car ferry company\nwhich maintains its own carriage distinct and independent by having separate\ncontracts, independent rates, and receiving direct instructions from the\nshippers concerning carriage by it, is not under common control, management, or\narrangement with another carrier. If, however, the transportation by a railroad\nand such a ferry company is covered by a through bill of lading, or by through\nrates or charges, or if there is any other arrangement indicating a common\ntraffic policy by the two companies, the ferry company may be an employer\nsubject to Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act. (c)   The exemption applies only to those\nemployees who perform activities which subject their employer to Part I of the\nInterstate Commerce Act. (d)   The term “employer”, as used in the\nexemption, refers to the person or persons who would be legally obligated to\npay OT wages, if not specifically exempted therefrom. (e)   Employees of an employer who leases\nrefrigerator and tank cars to railroads and shippers for the interstate\ntransportation of goods are exempt from the requirements of the FLSA under Sec\n13(b)(2). (f)   Employees of an independent railroad\ncontractor engaged in laying and grading track and other maintenance of way\noperations are not within the Sec 13(b)(2) exemption, even though the railroad\nexercises jurisdiction over the manner in which the work is performed and gives\nwritten approval for the wages and OT paid employees by the independent\ncontractor. The contractor, being engaged in construction work for a railroad,\nis not an employer subject to Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act. (g)   Employees of a railroad contractor,\nengaged in maintaining and servicing air-conditioning and car-lighting\nequipment sold to railroads, are not within the Sec 13(b)(2) exemption since\nthe contractor is neither a common carrier nor engaged in transportation in\ninterstate commerce. The fact that a railroad contractor may be subject to the\nRailroad Retirement Act or the Railway Labor Act is not a criterion for\ndetermining the application of the Sec 13 (b)(2) exemption.",
