  "text": "(a)   Sec 13(a)(2) applies to all employees employed by any\nretail or service establishment which meets the tests for the exemption except: (1)  An establishment or employee engaged in laundering,\ncleaning or repairing clothing or fabrics (however, see FOH 12e03); or (2)  An establishment engaged in the operation of a\nhospital, institution, or school described in Sec 3(s)(5); or (3)  An establishment to which Sec 13(a)(2) is inapplicable\nbecause of Sec 13(g). (b)  The application of Sec 13(a)(2) was changed by the\n1977 Amendments through changes to Sec 3(s). See Sec 3(s), FOH 12b00(d)(1), and\nFOH 12d00. The following illustrates this relationship: (1)  All enterprises covered under Sec 3(s)(1), 3(s)(2),\n3(s)(3), 3(s)(4), 3(s)(5), or 3(s)(6), whichever is applicable.  Retail or\nservice establishments of such enterprises cannot qualify for Sec 13(a)(2). (2)  An enterprise comprised exclusively of retail or\nservice establishments which met the ADV test on 6/30/78 but later did not. An establishment of such an enterprise must continue to pay its\nemployees the MW in effect on the day before the increase in the statutory ADV\nlevel took effect. (See FOH 12d.) If the ADV later falls below $250,000, Sec\n13(a)(2) is applicable. Sec 13(a)(2) will remain applicable to such an\nestablishment until the ADV for the enterprise rises to the current ADV under\nSec 3(s)(2) ($362,500). (3)  An enterprise comprised exclusively of retail or\nservice establishments which was not covered under Sec 3(s)(2) on 6/30/78. An establishment of such an enterprise would be exempt under Sec\n13(a)(2) unless and until the enterprise meets the expanded AGV tests of Sec\n3(s)(2): $275,000 effective 7/1/78 $325,000 effective 7/1/80 $362,500 effective 1/1/82 (c)   Hospitals, nursing homes, and certain schools do not\nqualify for Sec (13(a)(2) (see FOH 12f). (d)  A veterinary hospital is not a “hospital” within the\nmeaning of this exclusion from Sec 13(a)(2). Therefore, a veterinary hospital\nmay qualify for Sec 13(a)(2) if the tests are met. (e)   Schools described in Sec 3(s)(5) are excluded from\nexemption under Sec 13(a)(2). However, in some cases, particularly in colleges\nor universities, the school enterprise may operate (or lease for operation) on\nthe campus a separate and distinct physical place of business (see IB 779.302\n-779.305), which invites the patronage of the public (including students and\nfaculty) and which standing alone meets all the tests for exemption as a retail\nor service establishment. In such cases, such a separate establishment shall be\ntested for exemption in the same manner as any other retail or service\nestablishment. For example, if a college operates a bookstore which sells at\nthe retail level and the store is a separate place of business open to the\ngeneral public as well as the students and faculty of the university, having\nits own employees, management, accounts, and records, and meets other tests\nspecified in the exemption, the employees in the bookstore may be exempt from\nthe Act’s pay requirements.",
