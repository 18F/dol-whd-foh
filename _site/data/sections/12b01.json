  "text": "(a)           \nIn order for all employees of an\nenterprise to be covered on an enterprise basis under amended Sec 3(s), at\nleast some of the employees employed in the activities which constitute the\nenterprise must be engaged in commerce or in producing goods for commerce, or\nhandling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been\nmoved in or produced for commerce by any person. Thus, where the enterprise has\nsome employees so engaged, it is not necessary that two or more employees in\neach establishment be individually covered. The requirement is that the\nenterprise have some employees who are individually covered or engaged in\nhandling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been\nmoved in or produced for commerce by any person. Although two or more employees\nso engaged may be sufficient to satisfy this requirement, it is important to\nestablish, if possible, that the number of such employees is substantial or\nthat it represents a significant portion of the employees in the enterprise. (b)          \nIt is not necessary that the enterprise\nhave two or more employees engaged in the named activities every week since\nthis test as with other requirements for enterprise coverage under Sec 3(s) is\napplied on an annual basis. Thus, this requirement will be met if such\nemployees are engaged in the named activities on a regular and recurrent basis.\nThe requirement will not be met, however, where the enterprise has employees\nengaged only in an insubstantial amount of the named activities on isolated or\nsporadic occasions. (c)           \nIt is not necessary that the\nemployees engaged in the activities described in Sec 3(s) be nonexempt. Thus,\nfor example, the test will be met where one or more of the employees is exempt\nfrom Sec 6 or 7 so long as they are engaged in the named activities. Likewise,\nso long as the enterprise “has” such employees employed in its activities, it\nis not necessary that such employees perform their duties in an establishment\nof the enterprise.",
