  "text": "(a)   As noted\nabove, tips are the property of the tipped employee who receives them whether\nor not the employer claims a tip credit. Pursuant to Sec. 3(m), all tips\nreceived (i.e., given to or designated for the employee by a patron) by a\n“tipped employee” must be retained by the employee and the employer may only\nutilize the employee’s tips as a partial credit against its minimum wage\nobligation or in furtherance of a valid pooling arrangement. An employer and\nemployee cannot agree to waive such employee’s right to retain all tips received.\nA tipped employee must retain all tips received from customers and in addition,\nwhere the employer claims a tip credit, the employee must receive a direct or\ncash wage from the employer at a rate of at least $2.13 per hour and must\nreceive at least enough in tips to equal the minimum wage when combined with\nthe direct wage.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88) (b)   Tips the\nemployee receives in excess of the permissible tip credit are not considered\n“wages.”  Where an employer has claimed a tip credit, under the FLSA it has\npaid the employee only the federal minimum wage regardless of the amount of\ntips received by the employee in excess of the tip credit amount.  Because the\nemployee has only received the minimum wage (through the direct or cash wage\nand tip credit), any deductions by the employer for non-Sec. 3(m) items such as\nuniform costs, cash register shortages, and meal walkouts would result in a\nviolation of the employer’s minimum wage obligation because it would reduce the\ntotal compensation to less than the Sec. 6(a)(1) wage. (c)   Where an\nemployer does not strictly observe the provisions of Sec. 3(m), no tip credit\nmay be claimed and the employees are entitled to receive the full cash minimum\nwage, in addition to retaining all tips they may have received. For example,\nwhere an employer does not fulfill its obligation under 29 CFR 531.59(b) to\ninform its tipped employees of the provisions of section 3(m), or pays no wages\nto employees who receive tips, the full minimum wage in cash is due and no tip\ncredit will be allowed.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)  In addition, the employee must\nretain all tips received. (1)  WHD will not\nallow an employer to claim the tip credit on a retroactive basis where the\nemployer has not met the requirements for taking a tip credit.  For example, an\nemployer who pays no wages (i.e., employees received only tips) will be\nrequired to pay the full minimum wage and will not be able to claim a tip\ncredit.  This same principle applies when the employer pays some cash wage but\nless than the minimum required cash wage; for example, where the employer pays\na cash wage of $2.00 per hour the employer will be required to pay the full\nminimum wage (offset by the $2.00 payment) and will not be able to claim a tip\ncredit.  Similarly, employers who require tipped employees to participate in\ninvalid tip pooling arrangements (FOH 30d04) will be required to restore the\ntips to the employees and pay the full minimum wage. (2)  Employee\nretention of tips when no tip credit is claimed Tips are property of\nthe employee even in situations where the employer takes no tip credit.  For\nexample, an employer who is prohibited by state law from taking a tip credit\nand pays its employees the full minimum wage is prohibited from using its\nemployees’ tips other than in furtherance of a valid tip pool.  An employer\nthat does not take a tip credit would be in violation of the FLSA if it\nrequires its tipped employees to participate in an invalid tip pool that\nincludes individuals who do not \"customarily and regularly receive tips\"\nunder the terms of the statute, such as dishwashers and cooks. WHD will not enforce\nthe policy on ownership of tips under the FLSA prior to February 29, 2012, for\nemployers in the Ninth Circuit who did not take a tip credit.  See Field\nAssistance Bulletin No. 2012-1 (Feb. 29, 2012).  This enforcement position does\nnot limit the rights of any employee in the Ninth Circuit to bring a private\naction under Sec. 16(b).  The Ninth Circuit is comprised of the states of\nCalifornia, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Hawaii, and\nArizona.",
