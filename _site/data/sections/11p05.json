  "text": "(a)   Processing generally interrupts the movement of goods\nin interstate commerce. Individual coverage may exist on other grounds,\nhowever. The line to be drawn between operations that constitute a mere\nincident of the interstate distribution of goods received from outside the\nState and those that constitute processing that terminates the prior interstate\nmovement is a matter of degree. It is not possible to formulate any infallible\ntest that will serve to resolve every conceivable situation that may arise. It\nis not necessarily true that any processing defined as “production” in FLSA Sec\n3(j) is sufficient to break the flow of goods in interstate commerce. The test\nof what constitutes processing involves a number of factors, including the\ncomplexity of the operation, the change that is made in the goods, and the time\nrequired. (b)   Operations that have been held only incidental to\ninterstate distribution, and which will not stop the flow of interstate\ncommerce, include: the making of minor adjustments and performing minor services\non new automobiles; the blending of different grades of gasoline; and the\ncandling, sizing, and packing of eggs. (c)   Among operations that have been held to be processing\nare: the mixing of materials to make concrete; the making of sandwiches and\nother such products from crackers, bread, and the like; the pasteurization and\nbottling of unpasteurized beer; the blending of wines; the grinding or blending\nof coffee; the dilution, pasteurization, clarification and homogenization of\nmilk or cream; the bottling of milk; the neutralization and churning of sour\ncream to form butter the processing of cottage cheese to improve consistency\nand increase fat content; and, the making of chocolate milk.",
