While the work of a pilot requires dexterity, coordination,\na degree of physical strength and other physical and mental processes necessary\nto control an airplane or rotorcraft in flight, such work does not meet the\nprimary duty requirement for exemption as a bona fide executive,\nadministrative, or professional employee. (See 29 C.F.R. 5.15(d)(3) for the\nvariation from the CWHSSA OT requirements for pilots and co-pilots performing\non contracts for firefighting or suppression and related services.)",
