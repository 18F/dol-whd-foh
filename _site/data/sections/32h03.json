  "text": "IB\n778.418(a)(4) and 778.419(a) (3) provide that a piece rate or hourly rate will\nbe regarded as a ‘bona fide” rate for OT purposes if it meets the MW\nrequirements and is the rate “actually paid” for the particular kind of work\nduring nonovertime hours. However, situations may arise where the particular\nkind of work for which the rate has been established is performed only during\nOT hours. In such cases, and if the MW requirement is met, the rate established\nfor this work will be considered bona fide for OT purposes provided it is the\nrate which would be paid for the particular kind of work should it be performed\nduring nonovertime hours. For example, a rate of $2 an hour (which is equal to\nor in excess of the rate normally paid) may be established for janitorial work\nin a welding shop under an arrangement whereby the work will be done by certain\nof the shop welders, whose welding rate is $3 an hour. (The prior understanding\nof the parties is that this different kind of work will be performed by the\nwelders at the $2 rate and OT paid at 1½ the rate which is applicable to the\nwork performed during OT hours.) If the circumstances are such that the welders\nperform the janitorial work only in their OT hour., the $2 rate shall be\nconsidered a bona fide rate for OT purposes provided it is the rate which would\nhave been paid to the welders had they performed the janitorial work in\nnonovertime hours. The fact that the janitorial rate in this instance is 2/3 of\nthe welding rate (thus making the time and one-half OT rate for janitorial work\nequal to the straight time rate for welding work) is not material so long as\nthe janitorial rate is a bona fide rate.",
