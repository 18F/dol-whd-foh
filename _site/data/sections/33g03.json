  "text": "(a)  \nCertain HOs apply to whole\nindustries or processes.  These include: HO\n1 — Manufacturing or Storing of Explosives,HO\n3 — Coal Mining,HO 4 — Forest Fire Fighting and Fire Prevention,\nTimber Tract and Forestry Service Occupations, and Logging and Sawmilling\nOperations,HO\n9 — Mining other than Coal Mining,HO\n10—Slaughtering, Meat and Poultry Packing, Processing, or Rendering,HO\n13—Manufacturing Brick, Tile, and Kindred Products, HO\n15—Wrecking, Demolition and Shipbreaking Operations,HO\n16—Roofing Operations and on or about a Roof, and HO\n17—Excavation Operations.   Generally,\nmost of the work in the named industry or process is prohibited—with a few\nexceptions—such as office or maintenance work performed outside of the production\narea. (b)  \nOther HOs address only families of\nmachines or specific acts.  In some instances, many machines common to an\nindustry are prohibited.  These include: HO\n2  —Motor Vehicle Occupations,HO\n5  —Power-Driven Woodworking Machines,HO\n6  —Exposure to Radioactive Substances and Ionizing Radiation, andHO\n12—Balers, Compactors, and Power-Driven Paper Products Machines. (c)  \nOther HOs prohibit only those\nmachines that specifically are named as being dangerous.  These include: HO\n7  —Power-Driven Hoisting Apparatus,HO\n8  —Power-Driven Metal Forming, Punching and Shearing Machines,HO\n11—Power-Driven Bakery Machines, andHO\n14—Power-Driven Circular Saws, Band Saws, Guillotine Shears, Chain Saws; Reciprocating\nSaws, Wood Chippers, and Abrasive Cutting Discs. (d)   A few of the HO\nprohibitions are so broad in scope that they include not only the machines used\nin the industry at the time the report was issued but any similar machines\ndeveloped after the issuance of the HO.  For example, the ban on woodworking machines\n(HO 5) includes all computerized woodworking machines, and the ban on high-lift\ntrucks (HO 7) includes all types and uses of such trucks, whether specifically\nidentified or not. (e)   There are separate\nHazardous Occupations Orders covering agricultural work (AG H.O.) which prohibit\nminors under age 16 from performing certain tasks on farms.  These are\ndiscussed and defined in subpart E-1 of 29 CFR part 570.  Agricultural work\nactivities must be separated from nonagricultural activities so that the appropriate\nchild labor standard is applied. (f)   In order to reduce\nconfusion, the scope of each HO is discussed separately in the sections\ncovering the individual HOs (see FOH 33g05 and 33h).",
