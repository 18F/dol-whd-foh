  "text": "Deductions for article that do not qualify as\n“board, lodging, or other facilities” under FLSA section 3(m), such as tools,\nequipment, cash register shortages, and other similar items, may be made in\nnon-OT workweeks (i.e.,. weeks of 40 hours or less, and weeks in which\nstatutory OT does not apply) provided the employee continues to receive, after\nthe deductions are made, any required MW, free and clear, for all compensable hours\nworked in the week (i.e., average hourly earnings for the workweek after the\ndeductions are not less than the highest applicable MW enforced by WH).  (See\nRegs 531.35 and 531.36.) Deductions for non-3(m) items that cut into the\nhighest applicable MW enforced by WH are illegal in a non-OT workweek unless\nthe law establishing that MW (e.g., DBRA, SCA, H-2A, H-1B, etc.) allows the\nparticular deduction from wages.  NOTE: If a MSPA contract specifically\ndiscloses that the employer will make certain particularized deductions not\notherwise prohibited by other law, those deductions would be permitted. For\nexample, if a MSPA-covered employer disclosed a wage rate of $8.00/hour and\nfully disclosed in writing at the time of recruitment that $1.50/hour would be deducted\nfor non-3(m) items, and the deductions are otherwise legal and not prohibited\nby other applicable laws, then those fully-disclosed deductions are permitted\nto reduce the hourly wage to below the $8.00/hour contracted “promised wage”\n(i.e., to $6.50/hour). Furthermore, various other Federal, State and local laws\nregulate payment of wages, prohibit or restrict payment of wages in services or\nfacilities, outlaw “kickbacks,” restrain assignments, and otherwise govern the\ncalculation of wages and frequency and manner of paying them. Nothing in the\nFLSA or other WH-administered statutes, regulations, or interpretations\noverrides or nullifies any higher standards or more-stringent provisions of\nthese other laws. (See Reg. 531.26.) (WH enforcement in non-OT workweeks is\nlimited to the highest applicable MW enforced by WH, which includes WH-enforced\nprevailing wages when they apply (e.g., DBRA, SCA, H-1B, etc.).) If no OT has\nbeen worked in a particular week, WH will not enforce any other State of local\nMW higher than the highest MW applicable under the laws enforced by WH; the Inv\nwill advise the employer of the apparent violation of such other higher MW\nstandards and notify the appropriate authorities of the employer’s deductions\npolicies and possible underpayments that may have occurred. (See FOH 30b10.) Permissible\ndeductions in an OT week are discussed in FOH 32j08.",
