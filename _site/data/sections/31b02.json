  "text": "(a)  \nThere are certain circumstances\n(usually at locations such as hard-to-reach construction jobs, isolated\ndredging barges and offshore drilling sites) where practical considerations\nmake it necessary for employees to remain temporarily on the employer’s\npremises and to eat and sleep there during their stay. In such situations, the\nemployees shall not be considered as on “duty of 24 hours or more” if they have\na regular schedule of hours and thereafter are relieved of duties except for\nextra work required by the exigencies of the job. Only the actual working time\nneed be counted as hours worked. (b)  \nThe rules governing “duty of 24\nhours or more” (IB 785.22) are applicable where, from all the conditions of\nemployment, including the understanding of the parties, it is clear that the\nemployee is employed to wait rather than waiting to be employed. Among the\nfactors which would support such a conclusion are: (1)  the employee has no regular schedule of hours, or a\nschedule in name only, and is required to perform work on a helter-skelter\nbasis at any time during the day or night; or (2)  the employee has a regular schedule of hours but the\nunscheduled periods are so cut through with frequent work calls that this time\nis not his/her own. (c)  \nSome employers, such as offshore\noil well drilling contractors, arrange transportation to remote locations in\nsuch a way that two crews having regular work schedules as in (a) above, arrive\nat the same time. One crew will ordinarily go to work immediately and the other\nmust wait through an entire shift (or a substantial portion thereof) before\nstarting work. At the end of the tour of duty at the worksite, one crew, after\ncompleting its last shift, must wait through the last shift (or a substantial\nportion thereof) of the other crew before crews are transported back from the\nworksite at the same time. Such waiting time on the initial and terminal days\nis as much an integral part of those particular 24-hour periods as the idle\nperiods between the regular workshifts on the other workdays. Where the\nemployees are not on call and are completely relieved of duty, such idle time\non the initial and terminal days is not considered hours worked.",
