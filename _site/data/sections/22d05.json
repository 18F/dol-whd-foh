  "text": "(a)  \nAn exempt “creative” professional employee’s primary duty\nmust be the performance of work requiring invention, imagination, originality,\nor talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor, as opposed to\nroutine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work.  This requirement\ndistinguishes the creative professions from work that primarily depends on\nintelligence, diligence and accuracy.   (b)  \nExemption as a creative professional depends upon how much\ninvention, imagination, originality or talent the employee exercises.  Whether\nthe exemption applies, therefore, is determined on a case-by-case basis.  The\nrequirements are generally met by actors, musicians, composers, conductors, and\nsoloists; painters who are given at most the subject matter of their painting;\ncartoonists who are told only the title or underlying concept for a cartoon and\nmust rely on their own creative ability to express the concept; essayists,\nnovelists, short story writers and screenplay writers who choose their own\nsubjects and submit completed works to their employers; and persons in the more\nresponsible writing positions in advertising agencies.  Someone employed as a\ncopyist, as an animator of motion picture cartoons, or as a re-toucher of\nphotographs would not meet the requirements since such work is not properly\ndescribed as creative in character.  Journalists may satisfy the duties\nrequirements for the creative professional exemption if their primary duty is\nwork requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent, as opposed to\nwork that depends primarily on intelligence, diligence and accuracy. \nJournalists are not exempt creative professionals if they only collect,\norganize and record information that is routine or already public, or if they do\nnot contribute a unique interpretation or analysis to a news product. Reporters\nwho merely re-write press releases or who write standard recounts of public\ninformation by gathering facts on routine community events are not exempt\ncreative professionals. Reporters whose work products are subject to\nsubstantial control by their employer also do not qualify as exempt creative\nprofessionals.  See also FOH 22i25. 29\nCFR § 541.302(c) & (d)  (c)  \nTo qualify for exemption as a creative professional, the\nwork performed must be “in a recognized field of artistic or creative\nendeavor.”  This includes such fields as music, writing, acting and the graphic\narts. 29\nCFR § 541.302",
