  "text": "(a)   Whether or not the employees of a public utility, who\nperform construction-type work in connection with Federal and federal-assisted\nprojects, are covered by the DBRA will depend upon the nature of the contracts\ninvolved and the work performed thereunder. (b)  Where a public utility is furnishing its own materials\nand is in effect extending its own utility system, such work is not subject to\nDBRA. The same conclusion would apply where the utility company may contract\nout such work for extending its utility system. However, where the utility\ncompany agrees to undertake a portion of the construction of a covered project\nsuch work would be subject to the DBRA labor standards requirements of the\nconstruction contract. (c)   For example, DBRA wage provisions of the United States\nHousing Act do not apply to a contract between a local Housing Authority and a\ncity water department under which the department installs water mains in\nstreets adjacent to a housing project; connects mains and meters to the project’s\nplumbing; furnishes water to the project; and operates and maintains such mains\nand meters without expense to the Authority beyond an initial service charge,\nsince the city is engaged essentially in the extension of its water\ndistribution system rather than in the development of the project. (d)  Also, employees of a telephone company engaged in the\ninstallation of ordinary telephone facilities for a Government facility under\nconstruction are engaged essentially in the extension of the telephone company’s\nsystem rather than in Government construction, and, therefore, are not covered\nby the D-B Act. However, removal and relocation of telephone lines at the sole\noption of the Government to eliminate interference of the lines with\nconstruction at the project site is construction work covered by the D-B Act.",
