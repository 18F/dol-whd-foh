  "text": "(a)  \nSection 12(a) of the FLSA states\nthat “[n]o producer, manufacturer, or dealer shall ship or deliver for shipment\nin commerce any goods produced in an establishment in the United States in or\nabout which within thirty days prior to the removal of such goods therefrom any\noppressive child labor has been employed.”  Such “goods” are referred to as\n“hot goods” (see FOH 33a02(c)(1)b for an example of “hot goods”). \n29 CFR 570.104 through 570.111 contain the provisions related to\ncoverage under § 12(a).   (1)  The term goods is defined in § 3(i) of\nthe FLSA as “goods [], wares, products, commodities, merchandise, or articles\nor subjects of commerce of any character, or any part or ingredient thereof . .\n.”  This definition expressly excludes goods after their delivery into the\nactual physical possession of an ultimate consumer other than a producer,\nmanufacturer, or processor.  The term includes such items as foodstuffs,\nclothing, machinery, printed materials, blueprints, and also includes\nintangibles (see 29 CFR 570.107).   (2)  The term commerce is defined in FLSA §\n3(b) as meaning “trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or\ncommunication among the several States or between any State and any place\noutside thereof.”  (3)  The term oppressive child labor is defined in FLSA §\n3(l).  For purposes of § 12(a), oppressive child labor can and does occur in\nestablishments whose minor employees are not covered on an individual or\nenterprise basis under FLSA § 12(c) because the definition of oppressive child\nlabor does not require that the minor employees be covered under the FLSA.   (b)  \nGoods produced in an establishment\nin or about which oppressive CL has been employed are barred as “hot goods” and\nare prohibited from being shipped or delivered for shipment in commerce under §\n12(a) if: (1)  Such goods were removed from the establishment while\nany oppressive CL was still being employed in or about it, or  (2)  Such goods were removed from the establishment within\n30 days after the employment of oppressive CL had ceased in or about the\nestablishment.   (c)  \nThe prohibitions of § 12(a) apply\nonly to the shipment of goods in commerce that were actually “produced” in and\nremoved from an establishment in or about which oppressive CL was employed.   (1)  These hot goods provisions are applicable even though\nthe under-age employee does not himself or herself engage in the production of\nthe goods, as long as somewhere in the establishment in or about which he or\nshe is employed goods are “produced” which are subsequently shipped or\ndelivered for shipment in commerce.  It also does not matter if the youth’s\nemployment that constitutes the oppressive child labor is covered under FLSA §\n12(c). a.    \nFor example, § 12(a) would apply\nwhere 14- or 15- year-old minors are employed to load milk on trucks at a dairy\nestablishment and deliver it to households if the dairy establishment produces\nsome of its goods for shipment in commerce.  This employment constitutes\noppressive child labor because such work is prohibited by § 570.33(k) and (n). b.    \nThe hot goods provisions of §\n12(a) would also apply in the following example.  A 15-year-old minor works as\na cashier in a small retail bakery that makes cakes and pies, some of which are\nshipped, or delivered for shipment, in commerce.  Assume the minor does not\nhandle checks or credit card transactions.  Because the ADV of the enterprise\nis under $500,000, the minor would not be covered on an “enterprise basis”\nunder § 12(c).  Because the minor is not “employed in commerce” or in the\n“production of goods for commerce,” he or she is not covered on an individual\nbasis.  But if this minor’s employment was in violation of the child labor\nstandards—such as working until 10:00 p.m. in violation of the CL Reg 3 hours\nstandards—oppressive child labor would have occurred.  The products produced by\nthe baker during the period of the oppressive CL, and thirty days thereafter,\nwould be “hot goods” under § 12(a).  c.    \nAs explained in section (c)(4),\nbelow, section 12(a) coverage also applies when a minor is employed by an\nemployer other than the establishment owner or operator if that minor performs\nsome work in or about the producing establishment.   (2)  Section 12(a) only applies to “hot goods” and bars a\nproducer, manufacturer, or dealer from shipping or delivering “hot goods” in\ncommerce.  To establish “hot goods” for purposes of § 12(a), WH does not have\nto show that a minor was engaged in the production of goods.  WH must only\ndemonstrate that a minor was illegally employed in or about the establishment\nwhere the goods were produced within 30 days prior to the removal of the goods\nfrom the establishment.  If 30 days pass after the CL violation, and no further\nviolations have occurred, the “hot goods” will have “cooled,” and shipment from\nthe establishment is permitted.  If the goods are removed before 30 days have\npassed, the goods are permanently “hot”.  Finally, § 12(a) does not bar\nshipment or sale of goods where the initial shipment does not occur until the\ngoods have “cooled”. (3)  A producer, manufacturer, or dealer may “ship” goods\nin commerce either by moving them itself in interstate or foreign commerce or\nby causing them to move, such as by delivery to a carrier.   a.    \nA baker “ships” its bread in\ncommerce whether it carries it in its own truck across state lines or sends it\nby contract or common carrier to its customers in other states.  b.    \nA manufacturer delivers its goods\nfor shipment in commerce when it transports its goods in state to a distributor\nwho, as the manufacturer is well aware, will ship the goods into another\nstate.  For example, a paper box manufacturer who ships a carton of boxes to a\nfresh fruit or vegetable packing shed within the same state, with knowledge or\nreason to believe that the boxes will there be filled with fruits or vegetables\nand shipped outside the state, has delivered the boxes for shipment in\ncommerce. c.    \nHowever, the word “ship” must be\napplied in its ordinary meaning.  It does not apply to the transmission of\ntelegraphic messages, for example (see 29 CFR 570.106(a)). (4)  Consideration must be given to both whether a minor is\nemployed “in” or employed “about” the establishment.  a.    \nA minor who performs occupational\nduties on the premises of the producing establishment is employed “in” that\nestablishment.  A minor is also employed “in” an establishment where the minor\nperforms most duties off the premises but is regularly required to perform\ncertain occupational duties in the establishment, such as loading or unloading\na truck.  This is true even though the minor is employed by someone other than\nthe owner or operator of the particular establishment.  b.    \nHowever, a minor is not employed\n“in” an establishment other than his or her employer's merely because such\nestablishment is visited by the minor for brief periods of time and for the\nsole purpose of picking up or delivering a message or other small article. c.    \nIf the minor cannot be considered\nas employed “in” the establishment, he or she may, nevertheless, be employed\n“about” it.  However, the minor must perform occupational duties sufficiently\nclose in proximity to the actual place of production to fall within the\ncommonly understood meaning of the term “about,” and the minor’s occupation\nmust be directly related to the activities carried on in the producing,\nmanufacturing or dealing establishment.   1.    \nFor example, a driver's helper\nemployed to assist in the distribution of the products of a bottling company\nwho regularly boards the delivery truck immediately outside the premises of the\nbottling plant is considered employed “in or about” such establishment, without\nregard to whether he ever enters the plant itself.  2.    \nOn the other hand, employees\nworking entirely within one establishment are not considered to be employed “in\nor about” a wholly different establishment occupying separate premises and\noperated by another employer. This would be true even though the two\nestablishments are contiguous (see 29 CFR 570.110(b)). (5)  Section 12(a) of the FLSA establishes a “good faith”\ndefense from the prohibition on shipping hot goods for a purchaser of these\ngoods who has acquired these goods for value, in good faith, without notice\nthat the goods were produced in violation of the FLSA, and in reliance on\nwritten assurance from the producer that the goods were produced in compliance\nwith the FLSA.   a.    \nFor example a wholesaler who\npurchases goods in “good faith” from a producer, manufacturer, or dealer of\nsuch goods, who in turn sells these goods in his retail establishment, would\nhave a “good faith” defense from the § 12(a) prohibitions.   b.    \nHowever, a person or firm that\nowns the goods throughout the production process, even though some or all of\nthe production work is done by independent contractors, or subcontractors or\nother producers of goods, cannot be a “purchaser in good faith” who is removed\nfrom the “hot goods” provisions of § 12(a).  For example, a garment\nmanufacturer could not claim that it was a “purchaser in good faith”, if it\nowns the product throughout the manufacturing process, even though the cutting,\nsewing, and embroidery work was all performed by independent contractors,\ncontractors, and subcontractors.",
