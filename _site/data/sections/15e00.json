  "text": "The terms “laborer” and\n“mechanic” are defined in 29 CFR § 5.2(m), and generally include workers whose\nduties are manual or physical in nature as distinguished from mental or\nmanagerial, and include apprentices, trainees, and helpers. (In the case of\nCWHSSA, see FOH 15j00.) The terms do not apply to workers whose duties are\nprimarily administrative, executive, professional, or clerical, rather than\nmanual (see also FOH l5e15). Generally, mechanics are considered to include any\nworker who uses tools, or who is performing the work of a trade. The DBA\nrequires payment of the applicable prevailing wage rate to all laborers and\nmechanics “regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to\nexist.”",
