See FOH 15e22(b)(3). (3) \nTruck drivers transporting\nmaterials or supplies between a facility that is deemed part of the site of the\nwork and the actual construction site. (4) \nTruck drivers transporting\nportions(s) of the building or work between a site established specifically for\nthe performance of the contract or project where a significant portion of such\nbuilding or work is constructed and the physical place(s) where the building or\nwork called for in the contract(s) will remain. (b)  Truck drivers are not covered in the following\ninstances: (1) \nMaterial delivery truck drivers\nwhile off “the site of the work.” (2) \nDrivers of a contractor or\nsubcontractor traveling between a Davis-Bacon job and a commercial supply\nfacility while they are off the “site of the work.” (3) \nTruck drivers whose time spent on\nthe site of the work is de minimis, such as only a few minutes at a time merely\nto pick up or drop off materials or supplies.",
