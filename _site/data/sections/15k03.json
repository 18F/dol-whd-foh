  "text": "(a)   The principles governing the determination of what\nconstitutes working time for purposes of the FLSA are followed in determining\nhours worked by laborers and mechanics performing work subject to CWHSSA.\nHowever, the application of the OT provisions under the CWHSSA differs from the\nFLSA in that only the hours actually spent on a covered contract or combination\nof covered contracts need be considered in computing the OT pay. (b)  In the case of an employee working for two or more\nemployers, all hours worked under the same contract are to be counted for\npurposes of CWHSSA OT even though the employers are disassociated or otherwise\nseparate, such as a contractor and a subcontractor. (c)   An employee working for the same contractor on two or\nmore separately awarded contracts subject to the CWHSSA is entitled to have the\nhours worked on all such covered contracts combined and to receive OT for all\nsuch hours worked in the w/w in excess of 40. (d)  When an employee performs two or more types of work\nfor which different hourly rates are applicable (i.e., different\nclassification, DBRA or SCA work which is all covered by CWHSSA or noncovered work,\netc.), the CWHSSA overtime premium is computed under FLSA principles (FOH 32b05\nand 32h). (e)   CWHSSA does not have a site of work limitation on\ncoverage. All hours worked on covered contracts (even at a fabrication shop\naway from the site) are combined for determining CWHSSA compliance. (For\nexample: if an employee starts the day performing covered work at the\nfabrication shop and then travels to the work site, the time at the fabrication\nshop and the travel time between the fabrication shop and the work site is\nhours worked covered by CWHSSA.)",
