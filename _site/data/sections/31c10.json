  "section_title": "31c10. Compensability of travel time of employees who voluntarily drive\ncompany vehicles between home and work sites.",
  "text": "(a)  \nBackground: (1)  In some industries employers utilize somewhat modified\nvans or trucks for use by employees who perform service work at a customer’s\nhome or business establishment. The vehicle provides a necessary means for the\nemployee to transport needed parts, tools, equipment, etc., to various work\nsites during the day. The employer may give employees the opportunity to drive\nthe vehicle between home and work on a voluntary basis. (2)  In some instances, the employee starts the work day by\ncalling the employer’s dispatcher from home, receiving one or more work\nassignments to begin the work day, and traveling directly from home to the\nfirst work site rather than traveling first to the employer’s establishment and\nthen to the work site. At the end of the day the employee may be required to\ncall the employer’s dispatcher to advise that the last service call for the day\nhas been completed and that the employee is leaving the last work site for\nhome, where the employee parks and locks the vehicle. During this call to the\ndispatcher, the employee may or may not receive assignments for the next day. (3)  WH policy on the compensability of travel time in such\nsituations was set forth in an Administrator’s opinion letter dated August 5, 1994.\nIn light of the concerns expressed by both employers and employees, and the\npossible effects of applying this interpretation in a wide variety of\nindustries, the Secretary of Labor, on October 19, 1994, deferred any WH\nefforts to enforce the policy in that opinion letter while a review was\nundertaken. (b)  \nPolicy: An\nAdministrator’s opinion letter was issued on April 3, 1995, which withdrew the\nAugust 5, 1994, opinion letter and set forth WH’s position in this matter.\nAccordingly, where the following circumstances exist, time spent traveling\nbetween the employee’s home and the first work site of the day and between the\nlast work site of the day and the employee’s home need not be compensated: (1)  driving the employer’s vehicle between the employee’s\nhome and customers’ work sites at the beginning and end of the workday is\nstrictly voluntary and not a condition of employment; (2)  the vehicle involved is the type of vehicle that would\nnormally be used for commuting; (3)  the employee incurs no costs for driving the employer’s\nvehicle or parking it at the employee’s home or elsewhere; and (4)  the work sites are within the normal commuting area of\nthe employer’s establishment.",
