The MW rate applicable to such employment is that of Sec 6(a)(5),\ni.e., $2.20 per hour until 1/1/78, and Sec 6(a)(1) thereafter, except for the\nirrigation activities specifically described in the exemption which are\nperformed off the farm by nonfarmers. The latter are due the Sec 6(a)(1) MW\nrate. However, if the irrigation work which meets requirement for exemption is\nemployment in agriculture within the meaning of Sec 3(f), the possible\napplication of Sec 13(a)(6) should not be overlooked.",
