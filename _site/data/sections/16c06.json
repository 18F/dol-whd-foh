  "text": "(a)   The CCPA does not prescribe any time limit during\nwhich an improperly discharged employee or the DOL must file a complaint\npursuant to sec 304. In any case instituted solely under sec 304(a), the relief\nsought is elimination of the adverse effects of the unlawful action and redress\nof the employee’s rights by such means as attaining restoration to the same\nemployment held before wrongful discharge and restitution of the wages and\nbenefits lost as a result of the illegal discharge. Such relief is equitable in\nnature. (b)  In an equitable action, the employee’s neglect or\nomission to assert a right is to be considered in terms of whether there has\nbeen not mere delay but an inexcusable one prejudicial to the employer. Delay\noperates as a bar against the assertion of rights provided the employee knows\nof them and takes no steps to enforce them until the condition of the employer,\nin good faith, becomes so changed that restoration to the employee’s former\nstate is impossible or where witnesses and records necessary to the employer’s\ndefense are no longer available. These are considerations in applying the\ngeneral rule that persons who seek the aid of equity must show the use of\nreasonable diligence in asserting their rights and demanding their protection.\nInexcusable delay by the employee and consequent detriment to the employer will\ngenerally prove a bar to the exercise of equity jurisdiction. (See FOH\n52v13(b)(5).)",
