  "text": "Book\nclub copy editors, employed by a direct marketing firm, whose duties included\nthe following, did not meet the administrative exemption test because they\nperformed “production” duties: (a)  \nReading club marketing promotional materials prepared by\ncopywriters and making any necessary corrections for structure, grammar,\ncomprehension, spelling, clarity, and accuracy,   (b)  \nCorrecting the keying of test versions, checking for\nadherence to legal requirements for trademarks and copyrights, and ensuring\ncompliance with postal rules and scanning standards,   (c)  \nReviewing the accuracy of publication titles, authors’\nnames, code numbers, and prices, and ensuring that the company’s requirements\nfor style and procedures are met, (d)  \nOrganizing work priority to meet deadlines according to\npromotion schedules,  (e)  \nMaking decisions on workflow and communicating these\ndecisions to club copywriters.  The\n“production versus staff” dichotomy is instructive when evaluating whether duties\nare directly related to management or general business operations, but not\ndispositive of exempt status. But, when work falls “squarely on the production\nside of the line,” the administration/production dichotomy is determinative. The\nprimary duty of the copy editors described above falls squarely on the\nproduction side of the line for their employer, a direct marketing firm, and,\nthus, the employees are nonexempt. Their primary duty also involves the use of\nskill rather than the exercise of discretion and independent judgment. See\nFOH 22i00. 69\nFR 22141WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2006-45",
