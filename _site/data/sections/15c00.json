  "text": "(a)   Section 4 of the D-B Act provides that “this Act shall\nnot be construed to supersede or impair any authority otherwise granted by\nFederal law to provide for the establishment of specific wage rates.” Thus, for\nexample: (1) \nIf a railroad undertakes to\nperform a contract normally subject to DBRA, coverage is not extended to\nemployees of railroad common carriers if they are covered by the Railway Labor\nAct. However, if the railroad contracts out such construction work, laborers\nand mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors are covered. (2) \nWhile the D-B Act contains no\nexpress exemption for common carriers, coverage is not extended to common\ncarriers who are hauling over regularly scheduled routes in accordance with\npublished tariff rates and pursuant to a bill of lading. On the other hand,\ntransportation of materials from an exclusive borrow pit to fulfill the\nspecific needs of a construction contract would not normally be within the common\ncarrier exception since such transportation is not normally carried out over a\nregularly scheduled route in accordance with published tariff rates and\npursuant to a bill of lading. (b)  Under the terms of certain authorizing statutes, DBRA\ndoes not apply to construction of less than a designated number of housing\nunits. For example: (1) \nSection 110 of the Housing and\nCommunity Development Act of 1974 - rehabilitation of residential property\ndesigned for fewer than 8 families. (2) \nSection 802 of the Housing and Community\nDevelopment Act of 1974 - construction of residential property designed for\nfewer than 8 families. (3) \nSection 12 of the U.S. Housing Act\nof 1937 - fewer than 9 units. (4) \nSections 212, 220 and 233 of the\nNational Housing Act - fewer than 12 units. (5) \nSections 212, 221 and 235(j) (1)\nof the National Housing Act - fewer than 8 families. (6) \nSection 287 of the Cranston-Gonzalez\nNational Affordable Housing Act of 1990 - fewer than 12 units (c)   Section 14 of the United States Housing Act of 1937\nestablished the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP), under\nwhich HUD provides financial assistance to public housing agencies for\nimprovement of existing public housing projects and upgrading of the management\nand operation of such projects. Section 12 of that Act sets forth the labor\nstandards which must be contained in any contract for loans, annual\ncontributions, sale or leases pursuant to the Act, and provides that (1) all\nlaborers and mechanics employed in the development of a CIAP-funded lower\nincome housing project be paid DBRA wages, and (2) all maintenance laborers and\nmechanics employed in the operation of such a project be paid wages prevailing\nin the locality as established by HUD. While most CIAP-funded work items are\ndevelopmental for purposes of prevailing wage rate determinations and are\ntherefore subject to DBRA, certain work items (“non-routine maintenance”,\nformerly referred to by HUD as “major repairs”), in addition to routine\nmaintenance, are recognized as operational and are subject to HUD-determined\n(not DBRA) rates. HUD has issued guidance to its field offices and public\nhousing agencies (see also 24 CFR §§ 968.105 and 110), which distinguishes work\nitems subject to HUD-determined or to DBRA prevailing wages. In essence, repair\nor replacement necessitated by normal wear and tear over time is to be\nconsidered operational and outside the coverage of DBRA, provided that the work\nis not so substantial as to constitute reconstruction. Thus, conversion of\nequipment or premises and replacement or alteration of property which results\nin betterment and involves significant construction activity is subject to\nDBRA. Any questions on the proper classification of particular work items\nsubject to DBRA under CIAP which cannot be resolved locally with HUD will be\nreferred though channels to the RWS and NO, if necessary. WH does not enforce\nHUD-determined wage rates under CIAP. (d)  Construction projects administered by the Farmers Home\nAdministration and funded under the Community Facility Program of the Farm and\nRural Development Act of 1972 or under section 515, Title V of the Housing Act\nof 1949, as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, do\nnot contain D-B labor standards and are not covered if there is no other\nfederal assistance containing D-B labor standards. (e)   Projects solely funded under the Land and Water\nConservation Fund Act of 1965 or under the Colorado River Basin Project Act are\nnot covered.",
