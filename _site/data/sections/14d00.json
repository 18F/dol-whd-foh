  "text": "(a)   Where the principal purpose of a Government contract\nis to furnish services through the use of service employees, the contract is\nsubject to the SCA regardless of who is the direct beneficiary of the services,\nor the source of the funds from which the contractor is paid for the service,\nand irrespective of whether the contractor performs the work in its own\nestablishment, on a Government installation, or elsewhere. The fact that the\ncontract requires or permits the contractor to provide the services directly to\nindividual government personnel as a concessionaire rather than through a\ncontracting agency does not negate SCA coverage. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.133(a).) (b)  An administrative exemption is provided in 29 C.F.R. 4.133(b)\nfor certain concession contracts, such as those entered into by the National\nPark Service, including National Forests and in the National Wildlife Refuge\nSystem, which are principally for the furnishing of food, lodging, automobile\nfuel, souvenirs, newspaper stands, and recreational equipment to the general\npublic as opposed to furnishing such services to the United States Government\nor its personnel. This exemption does not affect a concession contractor’s\nobligation to comply with the labor standards provisions of any other statutes\nsuch as the CWHSSA, DBA, and FLSA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.133(b).) (c)   Questions arise in distinguishing between a contract\nwhose principal purpose is the furnishing of services through the use of\nservice employees (subject to the SCA) and a contract which is not for the\npurpose of procuring services, but rather only sets forth general conditions\nunder which persons desiring to transact business with individuals on Government\ninstallations may enter and do so. Such agreements are not subject to the SCA. (1) \nFor example, where the concession\ncontract provides for the use of Government space or equipment on the\ninstallation for the activity involved, or prescribes to a significant extent\nconditions relating to prices, performance, and quality or type of service, the\ncontract would generally be considered to have as its principal purpose the\nfurnishing of services desired by the Government for its personnel, and be\nsubject to the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.133(a).) (2) \nIn contrast, SCA coverage would\nnot be asserted on a concession contract or agreement which merely requires a\ncontractor to comply with general police regulations designed to control\ntraffic, maintain order, and suppress nuisances. SCA coverage would not be\nasserted where the requirements imposed by the contract or agreement on the\ncontractor are limited to such matters as restricting solicitation or pick-up\npractices to specified areas on the installation, restricting hours of\noperation, requiring observance of speed limits, or other rules and regulations\ngenerally applicable to those permitted to do business on a Government\ninstallation. Also, absent other evidence that the contract’s purpose is to\nsecure services, SCA coverage will not be asserted by reason of inclusion in\nthe contract of requirements to ensure the responsibility of the contractor\nsuch as bonding or licensing requirements.",
