  "text": "(a)           \nWhere the golf facilities operated\nby a professional at a country club are held out as a place where goods and\nservices can be obtained to meet more completely and conveniently the needs and\ndesires of the club’s members it expects to service, It would be unrealistic to\nregard the activities of such facilities as functionally separated from those\nof the country club as a whole, for purposes of enterprise coverage. Rather,\nthe relationship of the business activities in providing goods and services to\nthe club’s members is functionally close and immediately connected with a\nsingle business purpose common to the golf facilities and the country club. The\nAct’s definition of “enterprise” contemplates that the activities of “one or\nmore corporate or other organizational units” may be joined in a single enterprise\nmeeting the statutory tests. The effect of the agreement between the country\nclub and the golf professional is to bring about the performance through\nunified operations of the activities described so that they serve a common\nbusiness purpose, thus reflecting a situation much like that of companies\noperating leased departments in stores, which clearly are contemplated by the\nAct as included in the store enterprise. Therefore, Wage-Hour would consider\nthat the activities so joined form a single enterprise as defined in Sec 3(r)\nof the Act. (See also FOH 12a02(b).) (b)          \nThese golf professionals are not\nconsidered independent contractors of the kind referred to in Sec 3(r) as\nperforming related activities for the enterprise, as distinguished from these\nperforming such activities as participants in the enterprise. The term\n“independent contractor” as used in Sec 3(r) for the purpose of exclusion from\nthe term “enterprise” has reference to an independent business which performs\nservices for other businesses as an established part of its own business\noperations, and which deals in the ordinary course of its own operations with\nthe enterprise for which it performs services. The exclusion does not extend to\nthe performance of any related activities which, in economic reality, are\nintegral parts of the operation of the enterprise and actually performed\nthrough unified operation or under common control with its other related\nactivities for its common business purpose. Not only are such activities not\nexcluded from the enterprise, but the employees of the golf professional would\nbe covered under enterprise coverage to the same extent as other employees of\nthe country club.",
