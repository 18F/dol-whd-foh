  "text": "(a)   When tips\nare charged to credit cards, the employer may reduce the amount of tips paid to\nthe employee by the percentage charged by the credit card company\n(transactional fee). However the employer cannot reduce the amount of tips paid\nto the employee by any amount greater than the transactional fee. For example,\nwhere a credit card company charges an employer 5 percent on all sales charged\nto its credit service, the employer may pay the employee 95 percent of the tips\nwithout violating FLSA. (Rev. 563, 12/9/88) (b)   Payment\nof both minimum wage and overtime compensation, including the charged tips, due\na “tipped employee” must ordinarily be made at the regular payday for the w/w,\nor when the pay period covers more than a single w/w, at the regular payday for\nthe period in which the particular w/w ends. The procedures required to process\ncharges made by customers through credit cards may delay actual receipt of the\nfunds by the employer for one or two months. Nevertheless, the employer is\nrequired to pay over the charged tips to the employee on the employee’s next\nregular payday.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88) (c)   In some\nsituations, a credit card transaction is not collected from a credit card company.\nIn such cases, the employer is not required to pay a tipped employee the amount\nof tips specified on the credit card slip. Of course, this assumes the\ninability to collect is not a result of the employer’s failure to submit the\nslip for reimbursement, etc.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88) (d)   Where a\ncredit card charge is uncollectible, the employer is not required to pay the\nemployee the amount of tip specified on such credit card slip.  Instead, the\nemployer may recover from a tipped employee those tips that have been paid to\nthe employee when the credit card charge is uncollectible; however, such\nrecovered tips may not reduce the tips retained by the employee below the\namount of the tip credit claimed in the earlier workweek.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88) Where there are tip pools, tip pool recipients\nare responsible for reimbursing the employer for the share of tips from an\nuncollected credit card transaction which was allocated into the tip pool. The\ntipped employee who contributed the uncollected tip to the tip pool can only be\nheld accountable for the portion of the uncollected tip the employee received\nback from the tip pool.  For example, the tipped employee contributed $20.00 in\ntips from a credit card transaction that ultimately is uncollected to the tip\npool and received back from the tip pool 70% of the tips contributed to the\npool.  The tipped employee can only be required to reimburse the employer for\nthe 70% of the $20 of the uncollected tip that the employee received from the\ntip pool (i.e., $14).  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88) (e)   Cost of\ncollecting tips charged on credit cards, over and above the amount charged by\nthe credit card company. Costs incurred by the employer related to\ncredit card use, other than the fee charged by a credit card company for\nprocessing may not be used to reduce the amount of the tips the employer must\ndistribute to the tipped employee. Such costs include, but are not limited to: (1)  The “time value\nof credit card collections,” (2)  The cost of the\ncredit card terminal, and (3)  The cost of\ndedicated phone lines. Any employer attempt\nto deduct an average standard composite amount for tip liquidation that exceeds\nthe amount charged by the credit card companies is not acceptable. WHD Opinion Letter\nFLSA 2006-1",
