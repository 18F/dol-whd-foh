  "text": "(a)   Sec 302(b) defines disposable earnings as, “that part\nof the earnings of any individual remaining after the deduction from those\nearnings of any amounts required by law to be withheld.” Examples of such\ndeductions are: (1)       \nFederal (FWT), state or municipal\nincome taxes; (2)       \nEmployee’s share of Social\nSecurity (FICA) and state unemployment insurance taxes (UCI); (3)       \nState employee retirement systems withholding\nrequired by state law; and, (4)       \nFederal employee retirement\nsystems (such as CSRS and FERS) withholding required by law. Under OPM\nregulations, voluntary Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) deductions are treated the\nsame as deductions required by law; however, note that WH does not have the\nauthority to enforce these regulations. (b)  Deductions not required by law are “disposable\nearnings” subject to garnishment. Examples of deductions from employees’\nearnings not ordinarily required by law are: (1)       \nMedical and hospital insurance\npremiums (these are considered required by law for federal employees under OPM\nregulations; however, note that WH does not have any authority to enforce these\nregulations); (2)       \nUnion dues and initiation fees; (3)       \nU.S. Saving Bonds; (4)       \nSalary advances; (5)       \nContributions to religious,\neleemosynary, or educational organizations; (6)       \nBoard, lodging or other\nfacilities; (7)       \nPurchase of stock in the\nemployer’s corporation; (8)       \nWage assignments not effected by a\njudgment; (9)       \nRetirement plan contributions\n(except those required by law and, under OPM regulations, TSP contributions;\nhowever, note that WH does not have the authority to enforce the OPM\nregulation); (10)    \nCredit union loan payments; (11)    \nUniform rentals; (12)    \nAllowances for attorney fees\npermitted by state law; and, (13)    \nGarnishment service fees permitted\nby state law. (c)   The following example demonstrates how deductions\nrequired by law are excluded in determining disposable earnings subject to\ngarnishment: \n\n\n \n  \n  Weekly Earnings\n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  $500.00\n  \n \n \n  \n  Less Deductions Required by Law\n  \n  \n  FWT\n  \n  \n  $85.39\n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  FICA\n  \n  \n  $37.40\n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  UCI\n  \n  \n  $5.00\n  \n  \n  Total\n  \n  \n  -$127.89\n  \n \n \n  \n  Disposable Earnings\n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  $372.11\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  Disposable Earnings \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  $372.11\n  \n \n \n  \n  Garnishment Factor (See FOH 16b00(a)) \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   X 25%\n  \n \n \n  \n  Amount Garnishable \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  $93.03\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  Disposable Earnings\n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  $372.11\n  \n \n \n  \n  Less: Amount Garnishable\n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  $93.03\n  \n \n \n  \n  Less: Internal Deductions\n  \n  \n  Union Dues \n  \n  \n  $10.00\n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  401(k) \n  \n  \n  $25.00\n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  Charity \n  \n  \n  $5.00 \n  \n  \n  Total\n  \n  \n  -$40.00\n  \n \n \n  \n  Take Home Pay\n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  $239.08\n  \n \n\n\n Internal deductions are\nincluded in disposable earnings, because the employer is not required by law to\nwithhold them.",
