  "text": "(a)   Section 7(2) of the SCA exempts from its provisions\n“any work required to be done in accordance with the provisions the\nWalsh-Healey Public Contracts Act.” (See 41 U.S.C. 356(2); FOH 14c00(b).) (b)  The regulations provide detailed guidelines for\ndelineating when contracts for major overhaul of equipment would be considered\n“remanufacturing” subject to the PCA rather than the SCA. Complete or\nsubstantial teardown and overhaul of heavy construction equipment, aircraft,\nengines, etc., where the Government receives a totally rebuilt end item with a\nnew (or nearly new) life expectancy resulting from processes similar to\noriginal manufacturing, will normally be considered “remanufacturing” subject\nto the PCA so long as the work is performed in a facility owned and operated by\nthe contractor. Contracts for routine maintenance or repair, inspection, etc.,\ncontinue to be subject to the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.117.) (c)  \nContracting agencies are required\nto initially determine whether work to be performed under a proposed contract\nwould involve principally “remanufacturing” work or service work based on the\nguidelines, and incorporate the appropriate PCA or SCA labor standards clauses\ninto the contract prior to soliciting bids. Application of the SCA or PCA to\nany type of contract not discussed in the regulations will be decided on a\ncase-by-case basis by the Administrator. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.117(b)(4).)",
