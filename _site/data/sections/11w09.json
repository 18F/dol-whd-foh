Thus, all employees in the ordinary chain store\nwarehouse receiving goods from outside the State are individually covered, even\nthough the distribution effected is entirely intrastate. Likewise, the\nemployees would be individually covered where the distribution of the warehouse\nor wholesale house is confined to a limited group of retailers, such as\nwholesalers who distribute only to members of a particular association of\nretail stores or to a limited number of retailers who handle the particular\nproduct or brand.",
