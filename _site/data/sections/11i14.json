  "text": "(a)   For purposes of IB 776.11, the Canal Zone in its\nentirety is considered an instrumentality of interstate commerce. In the usual\nsituation, therefore, all employees engaged in work on government contracts for\nthe construction, maintenance, and servicing of those buildings, areas and\nfacilities which are provided so that the Canal may function as planned are\ncovered on an individual basis. (b)   In applying the above rule, no distinction is\nwarranted between employees whose work relates to the physical facilities and\nareas through which the interstate or foreign commerce moves and other\nemployees whose work is confined to supporting facilities or areas which are\nprovided by the Government as integral parts of its program for using the Zone\nas an instrumentality of commerce. Examples of such support facilities, which\ntypically are necessary for the planned functioning of the Canal, are the\nfollowing: barracks, schools, mess halls, civilian and military family housing\nunits, and the like. (c)   Situations may be encountered where the work performed\nby certain employees is so remote from commerce of the production of goods for\ncommerce, and too insignificant as a factor contributing to the functioning of\nZone facilities as an instrumentality of commerce, that WH would not at this\ntime assert individual coverage on the basis of (a) and (b) above. Where the\nfacts in a particular case appear to support such a conclusion, all the facts\nshall be transmitted through channels to the RS for an opinion.",
