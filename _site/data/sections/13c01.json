(Note: Work performed prior to\n1/1/86 on contracts covered by PCA is subject to OT pay at time and one-half\nfor all hours worked in excess of eight in a day or 40 per week, whichever are\ngreater. PCA was amended by Public Law 99-145, effective 1/1/86, to eliminate\nthe daily OT provisions. Thus, employees paid on a fluctuating w/w basis under\nPCA prior to 1/1/86 must receive OT pay for hours of work in excess of 8 per\nday rather than 40 per week if the hours over 8/day are greater than the hours\nover 40/week.)",
