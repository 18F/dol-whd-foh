  "text": "(a)   Charter activities which meet the\nstatutory tests of Sec 7(n) are excluded from “hours worked” for OT purposes (see\nalso FOH 24g00(b) and (c)). Thus, only the time spent in charter activities\nwhich begins outside the employee’s ordinary workday or w/w is excludable under\n7(n). Where such a charter is of such duration that it carries over to the next\nworkday or w/w, such work continues to be excludable provided the employee is\nrelieved from duty at the conclusion of the charter until the next workday begins.\nAny charter activity performed in a regular workday or w/w (i.e., which begins\nin any part of the regular workday or w/w), must be included in “hours worked”\nfor OT purposes. (b)   The fact that a transit system regularly\nengages in charter work does not preclude the use of Sec 7(n). The term\n“regular” as used in Sec 7(n) relates to the employee’s activities, not the\nemployer’s. (c)   Sums paid for charter activities would be\nexcluded from the “regular rate” if such activities are excluded from “hours\nworked” pursuant to Subsec (a) above.",
