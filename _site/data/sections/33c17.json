  "text": "(a)  \n29 CFR 570.33(k) prohibits 14- and\n15-year-olds from loading and unloading goods or property to or from\nconveyors.  Under these regulations, conveyors need not be power-driven to be\nprohibited—some conveyors operate by gravity.   (b)  \nConveyors are not defined in the\nregulations but include any mechanical device, such as a continuous moving\nbelt, auger, or series of rollers, that transports bulk materials or packages\nfrom one place to another.  Conveyors are often found in warehouses, packing\nsheds, manufacturing establishments, airports (including mobile equipment used\nto load and move baggage and cargo), and retail establishments.  (c)  \nOther prohibitions of the CL Reg 3\nstandards, such as working in manufacturing, transportation, work rooms and\nwarehouses, or operating/tending power-driven machinery, may also prevent\nminors from working with conveyors regardless of the industry or type of\nestablishment.   (d)  \nWH does not interpret 29 CFR\n570.33(k) to prohibit 14- and 15-year-olds from working with the types of\nconveyors normally found at checkout counters in supermarkets and other retail\nstores.  (1)  Such conveyors have solid surfaces, are fully\nenclosed, and are designed with features that protect the hands and limbs of\nboth the operators and the customers who place materials on them or remove\npurchases from them.  The cashier controls the operation of the conveyor\nthrough a switch or foot pedal and the individual items placed on the conveyor\nare neither large nor heavy.  There also may be other smaller conveyors located\nbeyond the cashier that transport the items that have been checked to a bin or\ncounter where they are bagged.  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may also work with\nthose types of conveyors.  (2)  On the other hand, some stores may have an additional\ntype of conveyor system that is often located between the checkout station and\nthe customer vehicle loading area in the front of the store.  These conveyors\nmay use plastic bins or other storage compartments to hold bags of groceries\nthat are transported to the vehicle loading area.  These types of conveyors are\nnot enclosed, convey heavy loads, and may present hazards to young employees\nwho load and unload them.  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are prohibited from\noperating such conveyors under both § 570.33(k) and under the CL Reg 3 general\nprohibition against operating or tending power-driven equipment.  Such youth\nare prohibited from operating or tending such conveyors and may not load or\nunload materials to or from such equipment.",
