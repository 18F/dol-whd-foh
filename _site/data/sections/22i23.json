  "text": "(a)  \nInsurance claims adjusters generally meet the duties\nrequirements for the administrative exemption, whether they work for an\ninsurance company or other type of company, if their duties include activities\nsuch as interviewing insureds, witnesses and physicians; inspecting property\ndamage; reviewing factual information to prepare damage estimates; evaluating\nand making recommendations regarding coverage of claims; determining liability\nand total value of a claim; negotiating settlements; and making recommendations\nregarding litigation.   29\nCFR § 541.203(a)  (b) \nVarying levels of authority. In\nthe insurance industry, there are insurance claims adjusters with varying\nlevels of authority.  The claims adjusting duties performed by these\nindividuals when it is in the functional area of insurance is work directly\nrelated to management or general business operations of the employer or the\nemployer’s customers and thus meets the second criteria of the administrative\nexemption test. In\norder to qualify for the administrative exemption, the employee must also meet\nthe third criteria of the exemption test, “…primary duty must include the\nexercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of\nsignificance.” Generally, the exercise of discretion and independent judgment\ninvolves comparing and evaluating possible courses of conduct and then acting\nor making a decision after considering the various possibilities.  The term\n“matters of significance” refers to the level of consequence or importance of\nthe work performed.  The exercise of discretion and independent judgment\nincludes the employee’s authority to make independent choices free of immediate\nsupervision but does not preclude higher level review. An indicator of the claims\nexaminer’s exercise of discretion and independent judgment is the level of\nsupervision. For example, does the claims adjuster’s supervisor only spot-check\nwork or must the adjuster seek approval from a supervisor for settlements? The\nexercise of discretion and independent judgment must be more than applying\nspecific standards or procedures found in manuals. The following are examples\nof duties performed by claims adjusters that are more than applying specific\nstandards: evaluating independent medical examinations, evaluating\ninvestigations of accident scenes, hiring and interacting with nursing services\nto assist claimants to return to work, approving litigation strategy,\nparticipating in hiring experts, serving as lead negotiator in settlement\ndiscussions and using their own judgment about what the facts show, who is\nliable, what a claim is worth, and how to handle negotiations with the claimant\nin order to achieve a successful resolution. Claims\nadjusters who perform their duties under close supervision or in consultation\nwith supervisors and who have no, or limited authority, to make independent\nchoices do not meet the third criteria of the administrative exemption.
