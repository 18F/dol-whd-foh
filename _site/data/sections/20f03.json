However, the extent to which a CO must go in making an\nactual physical check of required distances will be governed by the needs of\nthe particular investigation. For normal investigation purposes, the distance\nbetween required points may be based on a \"rule of thumb\"\nmeasurement; that is, a roughly practical rather than a scientific measurement.\nOn a comparatively straight road the odometer reading on an automobile may be\nused, or the distance may be determined by the scale of miles on a map. (b)  Measurements for distances shall be\nmade from the nearest boundaries of the premises on which the establishments in\nquestion are located, the nearest boundaries of the farm or farms, and the\nnearest boundaries of the city, town, or village to be considered. Where some\nportion of a particular farm lies outside the specified distance, the entire\nfarm shall be counted as if it were within the specified distance. (c)  \nIf any difficulty\nis experienced in measuring distances where an unincorporated community is\ninvolved, the matter shall be referred to the AA for OFLS in order that the\n\"metes and bounds\" of the community as used in the 1980 Census of\npopulation may be secured from the Bureau of Census.",
