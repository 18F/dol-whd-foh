  "text": "(a)   Eligible\nemployees are entitled to FMLA leave for pregnancy or the birth of a child.  Both\nthe mother and father are entitled to up to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave for the\nbirth and to be with the healthy newborn child (i.e., bonding time).  Leave for\nbonding time must be completed during the 12-month period beginning on the date\nof the birth. (b)   Pregnancy\nand childbirth are also considered FMLA-qualifying serious health conditions.  The\nmother is entitled to FMLA leave for incapacity due to pregnancy, for prenatal\ncare, or for her own serious health condition following the birth of the\nchild.  A husband is entitled to FMLA leave if he is needed to care for his\nwife during her prenatal care or when she is incapacitated during pregnancy or\nfollowing the birth of the child.  Employees are not entitled to any additional\nleave for twins or other multiple births. WHD Non-Administrator\nLetter FMLA-45 October 14, 1994 (c)   FMLA\nleave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically\nnecessary due to the pregnancy or birth.  When the leave is for bonding time\nwith the newborn child, the employee may take the leave intermittently or on a\nreduced leave schedule only if the employer agrees. 29 CFR 825.203WHD Non-Administrator\nLetter FMLA 2002-4 (d)   A husband\nand wife who are eligible and employed by the same employer may be limited to a\ncombined total of 12 workweeks to care for the healthy child after birth.  See\nFOH 39e03. (e)   Leave to\nbond with and care for a healthy newborn or newly placed child is distinguished\nfrom leave to care for a son or daughter with a serious health condition.  An\nemployer may not require a medical certification for leave for bonding with a\nchild.  However, an employer may require the employee to submit documentation\nof the relationship between the employee and the child. 29 CFR 825.122(k) (f)   The FMLA\ndefinition of “son or daughter” includes a child of a person standing in loco\nparentis to the child.  Therefore, an employee who will assume the responsibilities\nof a parent to the child may take FMLA leave for the birth of the child and to\nbond with the child during the first 12 months following the birth.  See FOH 39d03(d)(4). \nWhether an individual stands in loco parentis to a child depends on the\nparticular facts of a given situation; however, a blood or legal relationship\nis not required.  For example, an employee who is in a same-sex relationship\nand who will share equally in the raising of a child with the child’s\nbiological parent would be entitled to leave for the child’s birth because he\nor she will stand in loco parentis to the child. WHD Administrator’s\nInterpretation No. 2010-3WHD Non-Administrator\nLetter FMLA-53 December 29, 199429 CFR 825.120",
