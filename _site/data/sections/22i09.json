  "text": "Case\nmanagers employed by a company which is a service provider for individuals with\ndisabilities were found to not be exempt under the administrative test. \nThe company worked with physicians and other third parties to help consumers\nwith disabilities increase their self-sufficiency at home and in the\ncommunity.  The primary duty of case managers was to meet and to work with\nconsumers to gather information, to assess each consumer’s needs, to assess the\ncosts of care, to prepare a plan of care, and to identify and to implement\nservices to meet the consumer’s needs.  Case managers did not personally\ndeliver or administer services to the consumers, but were responsible for\nplanning and helping to obtain those services from third-party service\nproviders. Case\nmanagers did not operate pursuant to written protocols or formulas. \nRather, case managers drew upon their education and experience to identify and\nto procure whatever group of services may be appropriate for each consumer,\nmaximizing that consumer’s ability to live outside an institution (such as a\ngroup home, assisted living center, nursing home, or state hospital). \nCase managers may have sought information and input from colleagues and other\nresources, but were independently responsible for developing a plan of care for\neach consumer.  Each plan of care was, by necessity, driven by the\nindividual needs and abilities of the consumer.  A plan of care may have included\nservices such as advocacy/case management, independent living skills training,\npeer support, physical therapy, cognitive therapy, speech therapy, occupational\ntherapy, or vocational rehabilitation. Case\nmanagers also monitored the delivery of services in coordination with the\nconsumer and third-party service providers.  In addition, case managers\nassisted consumers with related matters, including consumers’ eligibility for\nbenefits through Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and private insurance. Case\nmanagers performed their work free from direct supervision.  Case managers\ndeveloped and implemented plans of care without the requirement of approval by\na superior, but their work was regularly reviewed by a company vice president\nfor quality and timeliness. The\nactivities performed by these case managers were more related to providing the company’s\nongoing, day-to-day case management services for its consumers, which involved\nduties such as assessing costs of care, preparing a plan of care, and identifying\nand implementing services to meet the consumers’ needs, rather than performing\nadministrative functions directly related to managing either the company’s\nbusiness or any business of the company’s customers.  A case manager was\nnot primarily tasked with performing duties in any of the management or general\nbusiness functional areas described in 29 CFR § 541.201(b); nor was the case\nmanager primarily tasked with providing administrative services to the\nemployer’s customers as contemplated in 29 CFR § 541.201(c).  Therefore, case\nmanagers did not qualify for the administrative exemption.
