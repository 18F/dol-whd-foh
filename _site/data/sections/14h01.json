  "text": "WDs can be obtained from the\nwdol.gov website (http://www.wdol.gov) by the agency in two different ways. The\nagency has total discretion as to the method it will follow.  (a)   “e98” process. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.4(b).) (1) \nThe e98 is an electronic\napplication on the WDOL.gov website that contracting agencies may use to\nrequest WDs directly from DOL WH. The submission of an e98 requires the same\ngeneral information as required by the SF 98. (2) \nAfter a WD is sent to the agency,\nthe e98 system continues to monitor the request and if the applicable WD is\nrevised in time to affect the procurement, an amended response will be sent to\nthe email address identified on the e98. (3) \nIf the bid opening date for\ninvitations to bid (IFB), or if contract commencement for all other contract\nactions, is delayed by more than sixty (60) days the contracting agency must\nsubmit a revised e98.  (b)  WDOL process. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.4(c).) (1) \nAgencies may use the WDOL website\nto select the proper WD for the procurement. The WDOL website provides\nassistance to the contracting agency in the selection of the correct WD. The\ncontracting agency is fully responsible for selecting the correct WD. (2) \nWhere the incumbent contractor\nfurnishes services through the use of service employees whose wages and\nbenefits are the subject of one or more CBA(s), the contracting agency may\nprepare a WD referencing and incorporating a complete copy of the CBA into the\nsuccessor contract action. (3) \nThe contracting agency shall\nmonitor the WDOL website to determine whether the applicable WD has been\nrevised. Revisions published on the WDOL site or otherwise communicated to the\ncontracting officer are applicable and to be included in the contract if\npublished or communicated within the following timeframes:                                              \na.     For advertised procurement - 10 days or more before\nthe date set for bid opening;                                             \nb.     For negotiated procurement - before the award date if\nstart of performance is within 30 days of the award, or 10 or more days before\ncommencement of the contract if the contract does not specify a start of\nperformance date within 30 days from the award and/or performance of such\nprocurement does not commence within this 30-day period. (See also 29 C.F.R.\n4.5(a)(2).) (4) \nIf WH determines that the\ncontracting agency failed to incorporate the SCA stipulations and WD into the\ncontract, or inserted an incorrect WD to a specific contract, the contracting\nagency within 30 days of notice from WH, will amend the contract to incorporate\nthe SCA stipulations and/or correct WD as determined by WH. (See 29 C.F.R. §\n4.5(c)(1).) (5) \nIf a prevailing WD is not\navailable on the WDOL website, the contracting agency must submit an e98.",
