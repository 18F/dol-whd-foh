Consequently,\ntransportation by motor vehicle which is in “interstate commerce” under FLSA\nmay not constitute transportation over which DOT has the power to exercise\ncontrol and upon which the Sec 13(b)(1) exemption could be based. In applying\nthe exemption, however, and for enforcement purposes only, WH will consider\nthat a movement in interstate commerce for purposes of FLSA is also a movement\nin interstate commerce for purposes of the Motor Carrier Act, except where DOT\nor the courts hold otherwise. (See IB 782.7(b) and FOH 24d02.) (b)   If transportation which is considered\nintrastate under the FLSA is performed under operating authority granted by the\nDOT after a hearing and finding that it will accept jurisdiction under the\nMotor Carrier Act, it is the policy of WH to recognize this decision in\napplying Sec 13(b)(l).",
