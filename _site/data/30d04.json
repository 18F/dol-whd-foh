  "text": "(a)   The\nrequirement that an employee must retain all tips does not preclude tip-splitting\nor pooling arrangements among employees who customarily and regularly receive\ntips.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)  Employer-required, or mandatory, tip pools may only\ninclude employees who customarily and regularly receive tips. (b)   The\nfollowing occupations have been recognized as those in which employees\ncustomarily and regularly receive tips: (1)  Waiters/Waitresses (2)  Counter\npersonnel who serve customers (3)  Bellhops (4)  Busboys/girls\n(server helpers) (5)  Service\nBartenders (Rev. 563, 12/9/88) In addition to the\nabove listed occupations, WHD has recognized the following occupations as ones\nin which employees customarily and regularly receive tips: (1)  Sushi chefs or\nteppanyaki chefs who are similar to counter persons because they have direct\ncontact and interact with customers, prepare and serve meals to customers in\nthe bar area or customer tables. (2)  Bartender\nassistants or “barbacks” who are similar to bussers because they learn\nbartending under the tutelage of a bartender, have the primary duty of\nsupporting the bartender, and receive their tips from the bartender.   Barbacks\nwork primarily in the bar area and have the opportunity to occasionally\ninteract with customers. (3)  Sommeliers who\nexplain the wine list, bring the selected bottle of wine to the table, and\nserve the wine to the customers. WHD FLSA Opinion\nLetter June 28, 1985WHD Opinion Letter\nFLSA 2008-18WHD Opinion Letter\nFLSA 2009-12 There may be court\ndecisions in a particular region that address the parameters of what\nconstitutes a customarily and regularly tipped employee. The DD and ADD’s\nshould inform WHI’s of any cases that may apply. If the DD and ADD’s are in\nneed of further guidance, they should consult with their respective RSOL. (c)   It is not\nrequired that all employees who receive tips from a mandatory tip pool\nthemselves receive tips from customers as long as they work in an occupation\nrecognized as one in which employees customarily and regularly receive tips.\nThe amounts retained by the employees who actually receive the tips, and those\ngiven to other pool participants are considered the tips of the individuals who\nultimately retain them, in applying the provisions of Sec. 3(m) and 3(t). \n(Rev. 563, 12/9/88) (d)   The FLSA\ndoes not restrict the amount of tips an employee can be required to contribute\nto a valid tip pool.  The employer must notify the employees of any required\ntip contribution amount, may only take tip credit for the amount of tips the\nemployee ultimately receives, and may not retain any of the employee’s tips for\nany other purpose.  See 29 CFR 531.54.   (e)   Tips\ncontributed to a mandatory tip pool must not lower the rate of the employee\nbelow the minimum wage. Only those tips that are retained by the employee\n(either not contributed to a tip pool, or tips received from the tip pool) are\nconsidered in determining if the employee has received the minimum wage. (f)   Tipped\nemployees may not be required to share their tips with employees who are not\nworking in occupations in which they customarily and regularly receive tips.\nThe following employees would therefore not be eligible to participate in a\nmandatory tip pool: (1)  Janitors (2)  Chefs or cooks\n(other than performance chefs) (3)  Dishwashers (4)  Laundry room\nattendants (5)  Salad preparers (6)  Prep cooks (Rev.\n563, 12/9/88) (g)   However,\nit does not appear that Congress, even in requiring as a general principle that\ntipped employees retain all their tips, intended to prevent tipped employees\nfrom deciding free from any coercion whatever and outside of any formalized\narrangement or as a condition of employment, what to do with their tips,\nincluding sharing them with whichever co-workers they please. Tips given to\nsuch co-workers as are listed in this subsection may not, however, be used as a\ntip credit.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88) (h)  Tip Jar: A tip\njar is a form of tip pooling and should be handled in accordance with the tip\npooling provisions set forth above. (i)    Questions\nregarding eligibility of employees to share in tip pooling arrangements which\ncannot be answered on the basis of these guidelines should be submitted through\nchannels to the NO/DEPP for resolution. In the case of host/hostesses, head\nwaiters or seater/greeters and other employees not referred to above, facts\nshould be developed showing the practices regarding their sharing of tips in\nthe locality and type of establishment involved.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)",
