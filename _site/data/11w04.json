  "text": "(a)   Personnel engaged in watching and guarding buildings,\npremises, equipment and other goods may be subject to the FLSA as either\nengaged in interstate commerce, or in the production of goods for interstate\ncommerce. Employees engaged in watching or guarding the following instrumentalities\nof interstate commerce are engaged in interstate commerce: (1)  movable facilities of interstate commerce, such as\ntrucks, railroad cars, or ships, whether empty or loaded; (2)  fixed facilities of interstate commerce, such as\ninterstate warehouse buildings, freight and passenger terminals, power\ntransmission buildings, telephone exchanges, and radio stations; and (3)  covered construction of the channels of interstate\ncommerce, such as interstate highways, waterways, and railroad roadbeds. This\nis true even though the watchman is employed by an independent protective\nagency. (b)   watchman who is employed at a fixed facility of\ninterstate commerce, such as a warehouse or distribution depot devoted to the\nreceipt and shipment of goods in interstate commerce is covered on an\nindividual basis. Similarly, an employee who watches goods which by their\nnature have not yet come to rest is engaged in activities closely enough\nrelated to interstate commerce to be engagement in interstate commerce. For\nexample, if he watches trucks freight cars, and boats prior to the unloading of\nout-of-State goods, his work is individually covered. (c)   Employees engaged in watching or guarding buildings,\npremises, equipment, materials, or other goods that are being used in the\nproduction of goods for interstate commerce are subject to the FLSA as being\nengaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce. They are in\nprocesses or occupations that are closely related and directly essential to the\nproduction of goods watched or guarded. (d)   It is not necessary that the production operations\nmust be carried on at the precise moment that the watching or guarding is done.\nIf that which the employee guards is used regularly in the day time in the\nproduction of goods for interstate commerce, the night watchman is covered. Nor\nis it material that the plant which he or she guards is temporarily shut down,\nalthough for a fairly long period. However, where production has definitely\nceased and no further production is being contemplated, the watching or\nguarding cannot be said to be closely related and directly essential to the\nproduction of any goods. (e)   Whether a watchman who watches building materials on\nconstruction jobs is individually covered depends upon the nature of the\nconstruction job. In general, the watchman stands in the same position as other\nemployees, such as carpenters and laborers. Where the other employees are\nsubject to the Act because they are in processes or occupations that are\nclosely related and directly essential to the production of goods for\ninterstate commerce, the guard is individually covered. For example, employees,\nincluding watchmen engaged in the maintenance, repair, reconstruction,\nimprovement, or extension of facilities used in the production of goods for\ninterstate commerce are in closely related processes or occupations directly\nessential to the production thereof. Similarly, such work in connection with\nfixed facilities and channels of interstate commerce, such as warehouse\nbuildings, freight and passenger terminals, pipeline stations, telephone\nexchanges, radio stations, interstate highways, waterways, and railroad\nroadbeds, is so closely related to the interstate movement of goods through or\nover them as to be engagement in interstate commerce.",
