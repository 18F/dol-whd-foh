For\nexample, a church or religious order may operate an establishment to print\nbooks, magazines, or other publications and employ a regular staff who do this\nwork as a means of livelihood. In such cases there is an employee-employer\nrelationship for purposes of the Act. (b)           \nPersons such as nuns, monks, priests, lay brothers, ministers,\ndeacons, and other members of religious orders who serve pursuant to their\nreligious obligations in the schools, hospitals, and other institutions\noperated by their church or religious order shall not be considered to be “employees”.\nHowever, the fact that such a person is a member of a religious order does not\npreclude an employee-employer relationship with a State or secular institution. (c)           \nIn many cases the nature of religious, charitable and similar\nnonprofit organizations, and schools is such that individuals may volunteer\ntheir services in one capacity or another, usually on a part-time basis, not as\nemployees or in contemplation of pay for the services rendered. For example,\nmembers of civic organizations may help out in a sheltered workshop; women’s\norganizations may send members or students into hospitals or nursing homes to\nprovide certain personal services for the sick or the elderly; mothers may\nassist in a school library or cafeteria as a public duty to maintain effective\nservices for their children; or fathers may drive a school bus to carry a\nfootball team or band on a trip. Similarly, individuals may volunteer to\nperform such tasks as driving vehicles or folding bandages for the Red Cross,\nworking with children with disabilities or disadvantaged youth, helping in\nyouth programs as camp counselors, scoutmasters, den mothers, providing child\ncare assistance for needy working mothers, soliciting contributions or\nparticipating in benefit programs for such organizations and volunteering other\nservices needed to carry out their charitable, educational, or religious\nprograms. The fact that services are performed under such circumstances is not\nsufficient to create an employee-employer relationship. (d)           \nAlthough the volunteer services (as described in (c) above) are\nnot considered to create an employment relationship, the organizations for\nwhich they are performed will generally also have employees performing\ncompensated service whose employment is subject to the standards of the Act.\nWhere such an employment relationship exists, the Act requires payment of not\nless than the statutory wages for all hours “worked” in the w/w. However, there\nare certain circumstances where such an employee may donate services as a\nvolunteer, and the time so spent is not considered to be compensable “work”.\nFor example, an office employee of a hospital may volunteer to sit with a sick\nchild or elderly person during off-duty hours as an act of charity. WH will not\nconsider that an employee-employer relationship exists with respect to such\nvolunteer time between the establishment and the volunteer or between the\nvolunteer and the person for whose benefit the service is performed. Another\nexample is where an office employee of a church may volunteer to perform\nnon-clerical services in the church preschool during off duty time from his or\nher office work as an act of charity. Conversely, a preschool employee may\nvolunteer to perform work in some other facet of the church’s operations\nwithout an employment relationship being formed with respect to such volunteer\ntime.

Activities of students\nin such programs, conducted primarily for the benefit of the participants as a\npart of the educational opportunities provided to the students by the school or\ninstitution, are not “work” of the kind contemplated by Sec 3(g) of the Act and\ndo not result in an employee-employer relationship between the student and the\nschool or institution. Also, the fact that a student may receive a minimal\npayment for participation is such activities would not necessarily create an\nemployment relationship. (f)           \nThe sole fact that a student helps in a school lunchroom or\ncafeteria for periods of 30 minutes to an hour per day in exchange for their\nlunch is not considered to be sufficient to make him or her an employee of the\nschool, regardless of whether he or she performs such work regularly or only on\noccasion.

In such cases, the time devoted\nto cafeteria work in the aggregate would be less than if the student worked an\nhour per day.

Individual coverage on\nthis basis may arise from a variety of activities. For example, a building\nswitchboard operator would be individually covered if he or she regularly and\nrecurringly handles interstate telephone calls for tenants. Likewise, a porter\nor elevator operator who regularly and recurringly handles interstate freight\nand packages for tenants would be individually covered. Moreover, an elevator\noperator is individually covered if letter carriers and parcel post conveyers\nregularly and recurringly ride the elevator he or she operates to make\ndeliveries of letters and parcels which have moved in interstate commerce. (c)   A building maintenance or custodial employee will be\nconsidered to be individually covered if as a regular and recurring part of\ntheir duties they serve those portions of the building occupied by a tenant\nengaged in that location in interstate commerce or the production of goods for\ninterstate commerce. Such an employee will be individually covered, as if he or\nshe were employed by the tenant himself to perform the covered work. For\nexample, a janitor would be covered if as a part of their duties they regularly\nand recurringly clean those portions of the building occupied by an interstate\ninsurance firm or a bank (thereby being engaged in the insurance firm’s or\nbank’s production of goods for interstate commerce). Likewise, a janitor would\nbe covered if as a part of their duties they regularly and recurringly clean\nthose portions of a building occupied by a radio or TV station engaged in\ninterstate communications. In applying these principles to any employee the\nelement of substantiality must be taken into consideration. For example, a\njanitor would not be considered covered  solely on the basis of taking a few\nminutes each day to empty waste baskets in an “interstate” insurance office, or\nbecause, on occasion, called upon outside their regular duties to perform some\nincidental cleaning task in a bank. Nor would the performance of maintenance or\ncustodial services in those portions of the building occupied by an\n“essentially local” business provide a basis of coverage, if the same work\nwould not provide a basis of coverage for a worker employed by such a tenant.\nCases where coverage is questionable will be submitted through channels to the\nRS for opinion, including all cases where compliance depends on the application\nof these principles to custodial employees who clean only the halls and\ncorridors outside the portions of the building occupied by “interstate”\ntenants, or building engineers whose duties relate to the building in general\n(heating air-conditioning, etc.). (d)   Without regard to any other basis of coverage,\nmaintenance and custodial employees are covered on an individual basis if the\nbuilding for which they perform these functions is devoted to interstate\ncommerce or to the production of goods for interstate commerce to such a\nsubstantial extent that there may be said to be a “close and immediate tie”\nbetween the activities of such employees and the interstate commerce or\nproduction involved. On this basis the Act has been held to cover all building\nmaintenance and custodial employees in loft buildings where goods are\nphysically produced for interstate commerce, in headquarters buildings of\ncompanies engaged elsewhere in producing goods for interstate commerce, in\nbuildings substantially devoted to interstate operations of insurance companies\nor government agencies, and in multi-tenant office or other buildings in which\noccupants engaged in actual production of goods for commerce on the premises\nutilize a substantial portion of the rentable areas for their operations.\nBuilding maintenance and custodial employees are not individually covered by\nthe Act solely by reason of the fact that they service buildings operated as a\nlocal activity not dedicated in any way to interstate commerce or to the\nproduction of goods for such commerce, which are held out for tenancy by and\nare in fact tenanted by the “usual miscellany” of offices, in which no\nmanufacturing is carried on. In determining whether or not the building as a\nwhole is so maintained and operated as to have a “close and immediate tie” to\ninterstate commerce or the production of goods for interstate commerce, it is\nnot possible to establish precise mathematical formulas based either on the\npercentage of rentable space occupied by specific types of tenants or the\nextent of commerce or production conducted on the premises. It is necessary to\nlook at the building as a whole and at the business operations conducted on the\npremises by its tenants. Where compliance depends upon such a determination,\nthe following procedure shall be followed: (1)  If at least half of the rentable area of the building\nis occupied by tenants substantially engaged on the premises in interstate\ncommerce or the production of goods for interstate commerce, the building as a\nwhole shall be considered as maintained and operated as an instrumentality of\ninterstate commerce or an interstate production facility (i.e., there is the\n“close and immediate tie”) and all maintenance and custodial employees shall be\nconsidered to be individually covered. (This would clearly apply, for example,\nwhere at lease half of the rentable area is occupied by such tenants as an\ninterstate insurance company or a bank, or some combination of such tenants.) (2)  If less than half of the rentable area is occupied by\nsuch tenants, the facts shall be obtained and the matter shall be referred\nthrough channels to the RS for opinion. In developing the necessary\ninformation, the approximate rentable area of the building, the types of\ntenants, and the business operations conducted by the tenants with particular\nreference to whether or not the Inv considers them to fall into the\n“interstate” or the “usual miscellany” category shall be included. This\ninformation can be shown by chart or in any appropriate manner with such\nexplanations as are required. For example, the percentage of rentable area\noccupied by “interstate” tenants such as banks, insurance firms, Federal\nagencies, manufacturers, and radio and TV stations can be shown in one column;\nthe percentage of rentable area occupied by the “usual miscellany” of local\ntenants such as lawyers, doctors, and real estate agents in another column (e)   The principles stated above do not apply to building\nmaintenance and custodial employees employed by a shopping center which is\ncomposed of individual buildings contiguously located for convenience, having\nonly party walls as a common ground between tenants. However, such employees\nmay otherwise be individually covered. (f)   In some cases, employees may be engaged to perform\nonly activities such as cleaning, waxing, and buffing floors, as opposed to\ngeneral janitorial services work. For purposes of individual coverage, such\nemployees are held in the same light as employees performing general janitorial\nservice work notwithstanding that their work contributes to the operations of\nthe customers’ buildings only from an aesthetic point of view and that the\nfinish on the floor has little preservative effect and does not add\nsignificantly to the wearability of the floor. Thus, such employees are\nconsidered to be individually covered in any w/w in which they perform such\nduties in truck terminals, banks, factories producing goods for commerce, etc.\nThe activities of these employees are distinguished from the activities of\nwindow washers, landscapers or exterminators.

Moreover, an elevator\noperator is individually covered if letter carriers and parcel post conveyers\nregularly and recurringly ride the elevator he or she operates to make\ndeliveries of letters and parcels which have moved in interstate commerce.</p><p>(c)   A building maintenance or custodial employee will be\nconsidered to be individually covered if as a regular and recurring part of\ntheir duties they serve those portions of the building occupied by a tenant\nengaged in that location in interstate commerce or the production of goods for\ninterstate commerce. Such an employee will be individually covered, as if he or\nshe were employed by the tenant himself to perform the covered work. For\nexample, a janitor would be covered if as a part of their duties they regularly\nand recurringly clean those portions of the building occupied by an interstate\ninsurance firm or a bank (thereby being engaged in the insurance firm’s or\nbank’s production of goods for interstate commerce). Likewise, a janitor would\nbe covered if as a part of their duties they regularly and recurringly clean\nthose portions of a building occupied by a radio or TV station engaged in\ninterstate communications. In applying these principles to any employee the\nelement of substantiality must be taken into consideration. For example, a\njanitor would not be considered covered  solely on the basis of taking a few\nminutes each day to empty waste baskets in an “interstate” insurance office, or\nbecause, on occasion, called upon outside their regular duties to perform some\nincidental cleaning task in a bank. Nor would the performance of maintenance or\ncustodial services in those portions of the building occupied by an\n“essentially local” business provide a basis of coverage, if the same work\nwould not provide a basis of coverage for a worker employed by such a tenant.\nCases where coverage is questionable will be submitted through channels to the\nRS for opinion, including all cases where compliance depends on the application\nof these principles to custodial employees who clean only the halls and\ncorridors outside the portions of the building occupied by “interstate”\ntenants, or building engineers whose duties relate to the building in general\n(heating air-conditioning, etc.).</p><p>(d)   Without regard to any other basis of coverage,\nmaintenance and custodial employees are covered on an individual basis if the\nbuilding for which they perform these functions is devoted to interstate\ncommerce or to the production of goods for interstate commerce to such a\nsubstantial extent that there may be said to be a “close and immediate tie”\nbetween the activities of such employees and the interstate commerce or\nproduction involved. On this basis the Act has been held to cover all building\nmaintenance and custodial employees in loft buildings where goods are\nphysically produced for interstate commerce, in headquarters buildings of\ncompanies engaged elsewhere in producing goods for interstate commerce, in\nbuildings substantially devoted to interstate operations of insurance companies\nor government agencies, and in multi-tenant office or other buildings in which\noccupants engaged in actual production of goods for commerce on the premises\nutilize a substantial portion of the rentable areas for their operations.\nBuilding maintenance and custodial employees are not individually covered by\nthe Act solely by reason of the fact that they service buildings operated as a\nlocal activity not dedicated in any way to interstate commerce or to the\nproduction of goods for such commerce, which are held out for tenancy by and\nare in fact tenanted by the “usual miscellany” of offices, in which no\nmanufacturing is carried on. In determining whether or not the building as a\nwhole is so maintained and operated as to have a “close and immediate tie” to\ninterstate commerce or the production of goods for interstate commerce, it is\nnot possible to establish precise mathematical formulas based either on the\npercentage of rentable space occupied by specific types of tenants or the\nextent of commerce or production conducted on the premises. It is necessary to\nlook at the building as a whole and at the business operations conducted on the\npremises by its tenants. Where compliance depends upon such a determination,\nthe following procedure shall be followed:</p><p>(1)  If at least half of the rentable area of the building\nis occupied by tenants substantially engaged on the premises in interstate\ncommerce or the production of goods for interstate commerce, the building as a\nwhole shall be considered as maintained and operated as an instrumentality of\ninterstate commerce or an interstate production facility (i.e., there is the\n“close and immediate tie”) and all maintenance and custodial employees shall be\nconsidered to be individually covered. (This would clearly apply, for example,\nwhere at lease half of the rentable area is occupied by such tenants as an\ninterstate insurance company or a bank, or some combination of such tenants.)</p><p>(2)  If less than half of the rentable area is occupied by\nsuch tenants, the facts shall be obtained and the matter shall be referred\nthrough channels to the RS for opinion. In developing the necessary\ninformation, the approximate rentable area of the building, the types of\ntenants, and the business operations conducted by the tenants with particular\nreference to whether or not the Inv considers them to fall into the\n“interstate” or the “usual miscellany” category shall be included. This\ninformation can be shown by chart or in any appropriate manner with such\nexplanations as are required. For example, the percentage of rentable area\noccupied by “interstate” tenants such as banks, insurance firms, Federal\nagencies, manufacturers, and radio and TV stations can be shown in one column;\nthe percentage of rentable area occupied by the “usual miscellany” of local\ntenants such as lawyers, doctors, and real estate agents in another column</p><p>(e)   The principles stated above do not apply to building\nmaintenance and custodial employees employed by a shopping center which is\ncomposed of individual buildings contiguously located for convenience, having\nonly party walls as a common ground between tenants. However, such employees\nmay otherwise be individually covered.</p><p>(f)   In some cases, employees may be engaged to perform\nonly activities such as cleaning, waxing, and buffing floors, as opposed to\ngeneral janitorial services work. For purposes of individual coverage, such\nemployees are held in the same light as employees performing general janitorial\nservice work notwithstanding that their work contributes to the operations of\nthe customers’ buildings only from an aesthetic point of view and that the\nfinish on the floor has little preservative effect and does not add\nsignificantly to the wearability of the floor. Thus, such employees are\nconsidered to be individually covered in any w/w in which they perform such\nduties in truck terminals, banks, factories producing goods for commerce, etc.\nThe activities of these employees are distinguished from the activities of\nwindow washers, landscapers or exterminators.

At\nsuch time as the ADV of the enterprise reached the later statutory level, it would\nbe required to pay the MW in effect at that time ($3.35 per hour since\n12/31/80). Once its ADV has risen to a later statutory level, the enterprise would\nbe required to continue to pay the applicable MW until such time as its ADV\nfalls below that level. Thereafter, it would be required to pay (1) whatever MW\nwas applicable “on the day before the statutory change took effect,” and (2)\nproper OT. For example, if an enterprise having an ADV of $362,500 fell to an\nADV of $300,000, its applicable MW would become $3.10 an hour, which was the\nstatutory MW in effect on 6/30/80, the day before the statutory ADV level rose\nto $325,000. If on the other hand, the ADV of the enterprise falls below $250,000,\nit would cease to be covered until such time as its ADV rose to at least the\ncurrent level of $362,500. (c)           \nCertain special problems which\nhave arisen from the application of the grandfather clause are as follows: (1)  A hotel or motel enterprise which is grandfathered\nunder Sec 3(s)(2) cannot pay OT based on the old partial OT exemption formerly\ncontained in Sec 13(b)(8) notwithstanding the fact that Sec 13(b)(8) was in\neffect at the time the enterprise was grandfathered. Sec 3(s) states that a\nretail or service enterprise which is grandfathered shall pay its employees in\naccordance with Sec 7. There is no implication that any exemptions which were\nrepealed are to apply currently to grandfathered enterprises because the\nexemption may have been applicable on 6/30/78, or thereafter. (2)  Retail or service enterprises which are grandfathered\nunder Sec 3(s)(2) cannot take a tip credit higher than that currently in effect\n(40%).   There is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that the higher\ntip credits which were available to employers prior to 1/1/79 or 1/1/80 are currently\nto be made available to grandfathered enterprises. For example, if $3.10 continues to be the MW applicable to a\ngrandfathered enterprise, the employer would be entitled to a tip credit not to\nexceed 40% of $3.10, that is, $1.24 per hour.

At\nsuch time as the ADV of the enterprise reached the later statutory level, it would\nbe required to pay the MW in effect at that time ($3.35 per hour since\n12/31/80).</p><p>Once its ADV has risen to a later statutory level, the enterprise would\nbe required to continue to pay the applicable MW until such time as its ADV\nfalls below that level. Thereafter, it would be required to pay (1) whatever MW\nwas applicable “on the day before the statutory change took effect,” and (2)\nproper OT. For example, if an enterprise having an ADV of $362,500 fell to an\nADV of $300,000, its applicable MW would become $3.10 an hour, which was the\nstatutory MW in effect on 6/30/80, the day before the statutory ADV level rose\nto $325,000.</p><p>If on the other hand, the ADV of the enterprise falls below $250,000,\nit would cease to be covered until such time as its ADV rose to at least the\ncurrent level of $362,500.</p><p>(c)           \nCertain special problems which\nhave arisen from the application of the grandfather clause are as follows:</p><p>(1)  A hotel or motel enterprise which is grandfathered\nunder Sec 3(s)(2) cannot pay OT based on the old partial OT exemption formerly\ncontained in Sec 13(b)(8) notwithstanding the fact that Sec 13(b)(8) was in\neffect at the time the enterprise was grandfathered. Sec 3(s) states that a\nretail or service enterprise which is grandfathered shall pay its employees in\naccordance with Sec 7. There is no implication that any exemptions which were\nrepealed are to apply currently to grandfathered enterprises because the\nexemption may have been applicable on 6/30/78, or thereafter.</p><p>(2)  Retail or service enterprises which are grandfathered\nunder Sec 3(s)(2) cannot take a tip credit higher than that currently in effect\n(40%).  </p><p>There is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that the higher\ntip credits which were available to employers prior to 1/1/79 or 1/1/80 are currently\nto be made available to grandfathered enterprises.</p><p>For example, if $3.10 continues to be the MW applicable to a\ngrandfathered enterprise, the employer would be entitled to a tip credit not to\nexceed 40% of $3.10, that is, $1.24 per hour.

Additionally, there are certain activities\nclearly reserved for State and local governments which DOL will regard as no\nlonger subject to MW and OT (e.g., the Courts, Legislatures and other governing\nbodies, tax assessor’s office). The Court’s decision does not discuss\nactivities which might be regarded as “nontraditional” such as State liquor stores,\nand utility and transit services. The majority opinion does state that the MW\nand OT provisions could apply to a State’s operation of a railroad. Questions\nwhich cannot be resolved because of uncertainty as to whether the function is\n“traditional”, should be developed and referred to the RS for an opinion.</p><p>(d)          \nThe Court’s decision deals only\nwith the MW and OT provisions of the FLSA.

The stock-on-hand rule permits the\ncontractor to fill the Government order, if it can, from goods produced or\nprocured prior to the award of its contract. Under it, while the Act does not\napply retroactively to work performed prior to the award of the PNA contract,\nit does apply as stated in paragraph (d) following, to work performed after the\ndate of the award of the PNA contract on the materials or articles supplied to\nthe Government. (d)  All work performed after the Government gives notice\nto the contractor of award of the PNA, on goods which the contractor knows or\ncan anticipate with reasonable certainty at the time the work is done will be\nsupplied to the Government under the PNA, must be performed in compliance with\nthe representations and stipulations contained in the Act and incorporated in\nthe PNA. However, as stated in Sec 22 of R&I No. 3, the necessity of\ncompliance with the representations and stipulations is confined to the period\nof actual engagement in work on the contract, “provided the records of the\ncontractor adequately disclose the period during which Government work is being\nperformed”. Thus, if, after notice by the Government of award of a PNA, the\ncontractor performs work on goods embraced within its terms which the\ncontractor knows will not be used to fill purchase orders thereunder, the\ncontractor may perform the work on such goods without the necessity of\ncompliance with the Act’s stipulations and representations, provided its\nrecords are adequate to segregate such work from Government work. But with\nrespect to work on any goods which, at the time of performance of such work,\nthe contractor knows or has reason to believe will be furnished to the\nGovernment in response to purchase orders issued under the PNA, compliance\nduring the period while such goods are being worked on is required without\nregard to whether the purchase order under which the goods will actually be\nfurnished to the Government has been issued. (e)   It will be noted that under paragraph (d) the date of\naward for purposes of the stock-on-hand rule is the date of award of the PNA\nrather than of the particular purchase order under it. As provided in Sec 22 of\nR&I No. 3, compliance with the representations and stipulations of the Act\nand regulations is required during all of “the period in which the contractor\nis actually engaged in the performance of work on the contract”. The period in\nwhich the contractor is so engaged will necessarily include any period after\nissuance of a purchase order under the PNA during which work is performed on\nthe specific goods supplied under that purchase order. The reason for this,\nhowever, is not because the date of the purchase order, rather than the date of\nthe PNA, is the date of the award of the contract. The controlling factor is\nthat at such time there can be no room for doubt that the contractor is\nactually engaged in the performance of work “on the contract” embodied in the\nPNA. With respect to work done on goods after notice of the PNA but before issuance\nof the purchase order which is filled with such goods, a careful evaluation of\nall the facts should be made to determine whether the contractor actually knew\nor could anticipate with reasonable certainty at the time such work was\nperformed that the goods worked on would be supplied to the Government under\nthe PNA. (f)   In any case when the application of this instruction\nis not clear, the matter shall be submitted through channels to the RS for\nopinion.

But with\nrespect to work on any goods which, at the time of performance of such work,\nthe contractor knows or has reason to believe will be furnished to the\nGovernment in response to purchase orders issued under the PNA, compliance\nduring the period while such goods are being worked on is required without\nregard to whether the purchase order under which the goods will actually be\nfurnished to the Government has been issued.</p><p>(e)   It will be noted that under paragraph (d) the date of\naward for purposes of the stock-on-hand rule is the date of award of the PNA\nrather than of the particular purchase order under it. As provided in Sec 22 of\nR&amp;I No. 3, compliance with the representations and stipulations of the Act\nand regulations is required during all of “the period in which the contractor\nis actually engaged in the performance of work on the contract”. The period in\nwhich the contractor is so engaged will necessarily include any period after\nissuance of a purchase order under the PNA during which work is performed on\nthe specific goods supplied under that purchase order. The reason for this,\nhowever, is not because the date of the purchase order, rather than the date of\nthe PNA, is the date of the award of the contract. The controlling factor is\nthat at such time there can be no room for doubt that the contractor is\nactually engaged in the performance of work “on the contract” embodied in the\nPNA. With respect to work done on goods after notice of the PNA but before issuance\nof the purchase order which is filled with such goods, a careful evaluation of\nall the facts should be made to determine whether the contractor actually knew\nor could anticipate with reasonable certainty at the time such work was\nperformed that the goods worked on would be supplied to the Government under\nthe PNA.</p><p>(f)   In any case when the application of this instruction\nis not clear, the matter shall be submitted through channels to the RS for\nopinion. Because of the complex issues, the Field should proceed very carefully\nin cases involving PNA’s.</p>"},{"section":"13b09","chapter":"13","section_title":"13b09 - Trucking of coal.","text":"The trucking of coal,\ndestined for the Federal Government under a prime contract subject to PCA, is\ncovered by the PCA regardless of whether the trucking is performed by employees\nof the primary contractor or by employees of an independent secondary\ncontractor.

On June\n14, 1972, the Department of Transportation published a notice in the Federal\nRegister (37 Fed. Reg. 11781) asserting its power to establish qualifications\nand maximum hours of service for contract mail haulers who operate in\ninterstate or foreign commerce. The FLSA’s § 13(b)(1)\nexemption may therefore apply to certain employees of contract mail haulers,\nprovided the tests for that exemption are met. See 29 C.F.R. § 782.8(b). Note,\nhowever, that drivers, driver’s helpers, loaders, and mechanics, whose duties\naffect the safety of operation of a vehicle engaged in transportation on public\nhighways in interstate or foreign commerce and who would otherwise satisfy the\nexemption, are nonetheless required to be paid overtime compensation if the\nvehicle used for mail haul purposes weighs 10,000 pounds or less. This is known\nas the “small vehicle exception” to the motor carrier exemption. The small\nvehicle exception applies and overtime pay is due to an employee in any\nworkweek when the employee’s work, “in whole or in part,” affects the safety of\noperation of a small vehicle. The phrase “in whole or in part” means an\nemployee who performs such duties involving small vehicles for the entire week\nor part of the week must receive overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in that\nworkweek. Note that the small vehicle exception\nwill not apply to certain vehicles A) designed or used to transport more than 8\npassengers (including driver) for compensation, B) designed or used to\ntransport more than 15 passengers (including driver) and not used to transport\npassengers for compensation, or C) used in transporting hazardous material\nrequiring placarding under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of\nTransportation.

The principles to be followed in determining an\nemployee’s length of service for vacation eligibility are summarized below.\n(See 29 C.F.R. 4.173.) (b)  Determining length of service. Most prevailing WDs require\nan employer to furnish employees a specified amount of paid vacation upon\ncompletion of a specific length of service with a contractor or successor;\ne.g., “one week paid vacation after one year of service with a contractor or\nsuccessor” or “one week’s paid vacation after one year of service.” Unless\nspecified otherwise in an applicable WD, the following two factors must be\ntaken into consideration in determining when an employee has completed the\nrequired length of service to be eligible for vacation benefits: (1) \nThe total length of time spent by\nan employee in the continuous service of the present (successor) contractor,\nincluding both the time spent performing commercial work and the time spent\nperforming on the Government contract(s) itself. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.173(a)(1)(i).) (2) \nWhere applicable, the total length\nof time spent in any capacity as an employee in the continuous service of any\npredecessor contractor(s) who carried out similar contract functions at the\nsame Federal facility. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(a)(1)(ii).) However, prior service as a\nFederal employee is not counted toward an employee’s eligibility for vacation\nbenefits under the applicable WD. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(a)(3).)  (c)   Eligibility requirement - continuous service. Under the principles set\nforth above, if an employee’s total length of service adds up to at least one\nyear, the employee is eligible for the specified amount of vacation with pay\nprovided in the WD. The term “continuous service” does not require the\ncombination of two entirely separate periods of employment where there has been\na break in service. Whether or not there is a break in the continuity of\nservice so as to make an employee ineligible for a vacation benefit is\ndependent upon all the facts in the particular case. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(b).) (d)  Accrual or vesting and payment of vacation benefits. Where a prevailing WD\nspecifies “one week paid vacation after one year of service with a contractor\nor successor,” an employee who renders the “one year of service” continuously\nbecomes eligible for the “one week paid vacation” (i.e., 40 hours of paid\nvacation, unless otherwise specified in an applicable WD) upon his/her\nanniversary date of employment and upon each succeeding anniversary date\nthereafter. There is no accrual or vesting of vacation eligibility before the\nemployee’s anniversary date of employment, and no segment of time smaller than\none year need be considered in computing the employer’s vacation liability,\nunless otherwise specifically provided for in a particular WD. The vacation\nbenefits need not be provided by the employer on the date of vesting. However,\nthe required benefit must be furnished before the employee’s next anniversary\ndate, before the current contract is completed, or before the employee\nterminates employment, whichever occurs first. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(c)(2).) (e)   Contractor liability for vacation benefits. The liability for an\nemployee’s vacation is not prorated among contractors unless specifically\nprovided for in a particular WD. The contractor by whom a person is employed at\nthe time the vacation right vests, i.e., on the employee’s anniversary date of\nemployment, must provide the full benefit required by the applicable WD on that\ndate before the employee’s next anniversary date, before the current contract\nis completed, or before the employee terminates employment, whichever occurs\nfirst. Thus, vacation benefits must be complied with in full on an annual\nbasis. Any unused vacation benefits may not be “carried over” from year to\nyear. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(c)-(d).) (f)   Certified listing of employee anniversary dates. In the case of a contract\nperformed at a Federal facility where employees may be retained by a succeeding\ncontractor, 29 C.F.R. 4.6(1)(2) provides that the incumbent prime contractor\nmust furnish a certified list of all service employees on the contractor’s or\nsubcontractor’s payroll during the last month of the contract, together with\nthe anniversary dates of employment (with the incumbent as well as predecessor contractors)\nof each such employee, to the contracting officer not less than 10 days before\ncontract completion. A copy of this list is to be provided to the successor\ncontractor for determining employee eligibility for vacation FBs which are\nbased on length of service with predecessor contractors (where such benefit is\nrequired by an applicable WD). Failure to obtain such employment data does not\nrelieve a contractor from any obligation to provide vacation benefits. (See 29\nC.F.R. 4.173(d)(2).) (g)   Rate applicable to computation of vacation benefits. The rate applicable to the\ncomputation of vacation benefits is the applicable WD rate or employee’s\nregular rate of pay, whichever is higher, at the time the vacation benefit is\nprovided or a cash equivalent is paid. If an applicable WD requires that the\nhourly wage rate be increased during the period of the contract, the rate\napplicable to the computation of any required vacation benefits is the hourly\nrate in effect in the w/w in which the actual paid vacation is provided or the\nequivalent is paid, as the case may be, and would not be the average of two\nhourly rates. This rule would not apply to situations where a WD specified a\ndifferent method of computation and the rate to be used. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.173(e)(1).) (h)  Cash equivalent for vacation. Where an employer elects to\npay an hourly cash equivalent in lieu of a paid vacation, which is computed in\naccordance with 29 C.F.R. 4.177(c)(5), such payments need commence only after\nthe employee has satisfied the “after one year of service” requirement (in\ncases where there is such an eligibility requirement). However, should the\nemployee terminate employment for any reason before receiving the full amount\nof vested vacation benefits due, the employee must be paid the full amount of\nany difference remaining as a final cash payment.

The single rate is generally\nupdated once a year based upon data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)\nEmployment Cost Index (ECI) summary of Employer Cost for Employee Compensation.\n(See 29 C.F.R. 4.52(a), 4.175.) (b)  “Fixed cost” per employee H&W FBs (29 C.F.R.\n4.175(a)).             (1) \nMost prevailing WDs containing\nH&W and/or pension requirements specify a fixed payment per hour on behalf\nof each service employee. This FB is due each service employee on the basis of\n“all hours paid for,” including paid vacations, holidays, and sick leave, up to\na maximum of 40 hours per week and 2,080 hours per year. Payments are specified\non the WD in hourly, weekly, and monthly amounts. (2) \nIf a WD specifies a FB that can be\nobtained for less than the amount of contribution required on the WD, the\nemployer must make up the difference in cash to the employee, or furnish\nequivalent benefits, or a combination thereof. The FBs and cash equivalent\npayments under the “fixed cost” per employee benefit requirement may be made in\nvarying amounts to employees, provided the total amount paid by the contractor\nfor FBs and/or cash equivalents to each individual employee is at least the\namount required by the WD. (c)   “Average cost” H&W FBs (29 C.F.R. 4.175(b).) (1) \nSome WDs specifically provide for\nH&W and/or pension benefits in terms of average cost. In such cases, a\ncontractor’s contributions per employee to a “bona fide” plan are permitted to\nvary, depending upon the individual employee’s marital or employment status. It\nis also possible under the “average cost” concept for some employees to not\nreceive any FBs. (2) \nThe contractor’s total contributions\nfor all service employees enrolled in the plan must average at least the WD\nrequirements per hour per service employee. In determining average cost, “all\nhours worked,” including overtime hours, for all service employees that were\nemployed on the contract during the payment period must be counted. The term\n“all hours worked” does not include paid leave hours, such as vacations,\nholidays, or sick leave. It also does not cover any unpaid leave time. (3) \nThe contractor’s total\ncontributions for all service employees enrolled in the FB plan(s) must average\nat least the FB obligation stated in the WD. The types and amounts of benefits\n(if any) provided, and the eligibility requirements for service employees to\nparticipate in a FB plan, are decided by the employer. (4) \nIf the contractor’s contributions\naverage less than the amount required during a payment period, the contractor\nmust make up the deficiency by providing cash equivalent payments or equivalent\nFB payments to all service employees who worked on the contract during the\npayment period. However, cash equivalent payments under the “average cost” FB\nrequirements can only be made in an amount determined to be deficient after\npayments have been made to the FB plans, and then must be made equally to all\nservice employees based upon their hours worked. A contractor cannot make cash\nequivalent payments to some employees and not to others, nor can a contractor\npay different cash amounts to employees under the same contract. A contractor\nmust pay the same amount of cash equivalent payments per hour worked to all\nemployees. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(b).) (d)  Some H&W and pension plans contain eligibility\nexclusions for certain employees. Also, employees receiving benefits through\nparticipation in plans of an employer other than the contractor or by a\nspouse’s employer may be prevented from receiving benefits from the\ncontractor’s plan because of prohibitions against “double coverage.” While such\nexclusions do not invalidate an otherwise bona fide plan, the employees excluded\nfrom participation in the plan must be furnished equivalent bona fide FBs or be\npaid a cash equivalent payment during the period they are not eligible, or\nchoose not to participate in the plan. An employee who desires to opt-out of\nthe contractor’s health plan must demonstrate that his or her other coverage\nspecifically prohibits double coverage in writing. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(c).) (e)   It is not required that all employees participating in\na FB plan be entitled to receive payments from the plan at all times. For\nexample, a contractor may be permitted to claim credit for contributions made\nto FB plans on behalf of participating employees during periods of time when\nthey may not be entitled to receive benefits (e.g., a 30-day “waiting period”\nunder some insurance plans for newly hired employees). If no contributions are\nmade for such employees, then no credit may be taken toward the contractor’s FB\nobligations. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(c)(2).) (f)   Payments to a “bona fide” H&W or pension insurance\nplan or trust program may be made on a periodic basis, but not less often than\nquarterly. If the plan requires that contributions be made on a monthly basis,\nthen to be in compliance the contractor must reconcile the cost incurred by\nsuch contributions against its SCA FB obligations on a monthly (or no less\noften than monthly) basis. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(d)(1).) (g)   Where the WD specifies a fixed contribution on behalf\nof each employee, and a contractor exercises the option to make hourly cash\nequivalent or differential payments, such payments must be made promptly on the\nregular payday for wages. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.165(a)(1), 4.175(d)(1),\n4.177(c)(1).) (h)  The only restriction the SCA places on pension plans,\nincluding 401(k) plans, is that they be “bona fide” FB plans. Such plans are\nconsidered “bona fide” if they meet the requirements of Section 7(e)(4) of the\nFLSA. (See FLSA 29 C.F.R. 778.215; SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.170, 4.171(a).) (1) \nNeither the SCA nor its\nimplementing regulations address vesting requirements with respect to retirement\nplans. However, bona fide plans are required to meet the vesting requirements\npursuant to ERISA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.171(a)(5).) (2) \nPension plans that define a year’s\nservice for vesting purposes in terms of a minimum number of hours worked by a\nparticipant and require certain number of years in service for a participant to\nbecome fully vested would be in compliance with the SCA so long as the plan’s\nvesting provisions meet ERISA’s requirements. (3) \nPension plans often provide that\nforfeitures of employees who do not vest under the plan will be used to reduce\nthe employer’s contribution in the following year. For SCA purposes, an\nemployer may not use forfeitures as a credit towards satisfying the\nrequirements of an applicable WD. To allow an employer to do so would result in\nthe employer’s taking double credit for the same contribution. Forfeitures that\nare allocated to the accounts of remaining eligible participants would,\nhowever, be creditable toward meeting FB obligations under the SCA.","html":"<p>(a)   As set forth in AAM No. 188, a single “prevailing”\nnationwide H&amp;W rate method has been established for determining FB\nrequirements to be incorporated in most SCA WDs.

Payments are specified\non the WD in hourly, weekly, and monthly amounts.</p><p>(2) \nIf a WD specifies a FB that can be\nobtained for less than the amount of contribution required on the WD, the\nemployer must make up the difference in cash to the employee, or furnish\nequivalent benefits, or a combination thereof. The FBs and cash equivalent\npayments under the “fixed cost” per employee benefit requirement may be made in\nvarying amounts to employees, provided the total amount paid by the contractor\nfor FBs and/or cash equivalents to each individual employee is at least the\namount required by the WD.</p><p>(c)   “Average cost” H&amp;W FBs (29 C.F.R. 4.175(b).)</p><p>(1) \nSome WDs specifically provide for\nH&amp;W and/or pension benefits in terms of average cost. In such cases, a\ncontractor’s contributions per employee to a “bona fide” plan are permitted to\nvary, depending upon the individual employee’s marital or employment status. It\nis also possible under the “average cost” concept for some employees to not\nreceive any FBs.</p><p>(2) \nThe contractor’s total contributions\nfor all service employees enrolled in the plan must average at least the WD\nrequirements per hour per service employee. In determining average cost, “all\nhours worked,” including overtime hours, for all service employees that were\nemployed on the contract during the payment period must be counted. The term\n“all hours worked” does not include paid leave hours, such as vacations,\nholidays, or sick leave. It also does not cover any unpaid leave time.</p><p>(3) \nThe contractor’s total\ncontributions for all service employees enrolled in the FB plan(s) must average\nat least the FB obligation stated in the WD. The types and amounts of benefits\n(if any) provided, and the eligibility requirements for service employees to\nparticipate in a FB plan, are decided by the employer.</p><p>(4) \nIf the contractor’s contributions\naverage less than the amount required during a payment period, the contractor\nmust make up the deficiency by providing cash equivalent payments or equivalent\nFB payments to all service employees who worked on the contract during the\npayment period. However, cash equivalent payments under the “average cost” FB\nrequirements can only be made in an amount determined to be deficient after\npayments have been made to the FB plans, and then must be made equally to all\nservice employees based upon their hours worked. A contractor cannot make cash\nequivalent payments to some employees and not to others, nor can a contractor\npay different cash amounts to employees under the same contract. A contractor\nmust pay the same amount of cash equivalent payments per hour worked to all\nemployees. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(b).)</p><p>(d)  Some H&amp;W and pension plans contain eligibility\nexclusions for certain employees. Also, employees receiving benefits through\nparticipation in plans of an employer other than the contractor or by a\nspouse’s employer may be prevented from receiving benefits from the\ncontractor’s plan because of prohibitions against “double coverage.” While such\nexclusions do not invalidate an otherwise bona fide plan, the employees excluded\nfrom participation in the plan must be furnished equivalent bona fide FBs or be\npaid a cash equivalent payment during the period they are not eligible, or\nchoose not to participate in the plan. An employee who desires to opt-out of\nthe contractor’s health plan must demonstrate that his or her other coverage\nspecifically prohibits double coverage in writing. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(c).)</p><p>(e)   It is not required that all employees participating in\na FB plan be entitled to receive payments from the plan at all times. For\nexample, a contractor may be permitted to claim credit for contributions made\nto FB plans on behalf of participating employees during periods of time when\nthey may not be entitled to receive benefits (e.g., a 30-day “waiting period”\nunder some insurance plans for newly hired employees). If no contributions are\nmade for such employees, then no credit may be taken toward the contractor’s FB\nobligations. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(c)(2).)</p><p>(f)   Payments to a “bona fide” H&amp;W or pension insurance\nplan or trust program may be made on a periodic basis, but not less often than\nquarterly. If the plan requires that contributions be made on a monthly basis,\nthen to be in compliance the contractor must reconcile the cost incurred by\nsuch contributions against its SCA FB obligations on a monthly (or no less\noften than monthly) basis. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(d)(1).)</p><p>(g)   Where the WD specifies a fixed contribution on behalf\nof each employee, and a contractor exercises the option to make hourly cash\nequivalent or differential payments, such payments must be made promptly on the\nregular payday for wages. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.165(a)(1), 4.175(d)(1),\n4.177(c)(1).)</p><p>(h)  The only restriction the SCA places on pension plans,\nincluding 401(k) plans, is that they be “bona fide” FB plans. Such plans are\nconsidered “bona fide” if they meet the requirements of Section 7(e)(4) of the\nFLSA. (See FLSA 29 C.F.R. 778.215; SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.170, 4.171(a).)</p><p>(1) \nNeither the SCA nor its\nimplementing regulations address vesting requirements with respect to retirement\nplans. However, bona fide plans are required to meet the vesting requirements\npursuant to ERISA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.171(a)(5).)</p><p>(2) \nPension plans that define a year’s\nservice for vesting purposes in terms of a minimum number of hours worked by a\nparticipant and require certain number of years in service for a participant to\nbecome fully vested would be in compliance with the SCA so long as the plan’s\nvesting provisions meet ERISA’s requirements.</p><p>(3) \nPension plans often provide that\nforfeitures of employees who do not vest under the plan will be used to reduce\nthe employer’s contribution in the following year. For SCA purposes, an\nemployer may not use forfeitures as a credit towards satisfying the\nrequirements of an applicable WD. To allow an employer to do so would result in\nthe employer’s taking double credit for the same contribution. Forfeitures that\nare allocated to the accounts of remaining eligible participants would,\nhowever, be creditable toward meeting FB obligations under the SCA.</p>"},{"section":"14k00","chapter":"14","section_title":"14k00 - General provisions.","text":"(a)   The SCA does not provide for compensation of covered\nemployees at premium rates for overtime hours of work.

The ARRA was\nsigned by President Obama on February 17, 2009. The ARRA appropriated\nsubstantial funding for construction, alteration and repair of Federal\nbuildings and for infrastructure projects. Federal agencies directly\ncontracting for construction work are required by existing DBA requirements to\nensure that bid solicitations and resulting contracts contain DB labor\nstandards and WDs. Federal agencies must ensure that recipients of assistance\nunder ARRA require contractors and subcontractors to pay laborers and mechanics\non Federally-assisted construction projects at least the prevailing wages as\ndetermined under the DBA. Specifically, Section 1606 of Division A of ARRA\nstates that DBA’s prevailing wage requirement applies to ARRA-appropriated\nconstruction projects, as follows: “Notwithstanding any other provision of law\nand in a manner consistent with other provisions of this Act, all laborers and\nmechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors on projects funded\ndirectly by or assisted in whole or in part by and through the Federal\ngovernment pursuant to this Act shall be paid wages at rates not less than\nthose prevailing on projects of a character similar in the locality as\ndetermined by the Secretary of Labor… .” The language “notwithstanding any other provision of\nlaw” explicitly overrides any limitation to Davis-Bacon coverage that may be\ncontained in other Davis-Bacon Related Acts. Therefore, if a construction\nproject is funded under multiple statutes, including one with a pre-existing\nDavis-Bacon related Act provision as well as ARRA, then the ARRA prevailing\nwage requirement applies if any such ARRA assistance is provided for the\nproject. Two provisions of ARRA exempt certain tribal contracts\nfrom Section 1606. One provision states that section 1606 does not apply “to\ntribal contracts entered into by the Bureau of Indian Affairs” with the\nappropriations provided under ARRA for repair and restoration of roads; school\nimprovements, repairs and replacement construction; and detention center\nmaintenance and repairs. A second provision states that section 1606 does not\napply “to tribal contracts entered into by the [HHS Indian Health] Service\"\nwith the ARRA appropriation for Indian health facilities construction projects.\nOf course, even though ARRA does not apply DB to those projects, if the\nprojects receive funding under another related Act that requires DB prevailing\nwage requirements, those requirements would continue to apply. Prevailing wage coverage under ARRA-assisted projects\nmust be determined in the same manner as under the DBA. ARRA-assisted projects\nmust follow the requirements in regulations 29 CFR 1, 3 and 5. (2) \nAAM # 208 outlined the\napplicability of the DB labor standards to projects financed with the proceeds\nof the five tax-favored bonds listed in section 1601 of Division B of ARRA. It\nalso highlighted the responsibilities of state and local governmental entities,\ncontractors, and others for implementation of, and compliance with, the\nDavis-Bacon labor standards in connection with projects financed with the\nproceeds of the tax-favored bonds. Specifically, Section 1601 of Division B of ARRA provides\nthat the DBA’s prevailing wage requirement applies to projects financed with\nthe proceeds of:                                              \na.     Any new clean renewable energy bond (as defined in\nsection 54C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) issued after the date of the\nenactment of ARRA Division B.                                             \nb.     Any qualified energy conservation bond (as defined in\nsection 4D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) issued after the date of the\nenactment of ARRA Division B.                                              \nc.     Any qualified zone academy bond (as defined in section\n54E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) issued after the date of the\nenactment of ARRA Division B.                                             \nd.     Any qualified school construction bond (as defined in\nsection 54F of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).                                              \ne.     Any recovery zone economic development bond (as\ndefined in section 1400U–2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986). An entity (usually a state or local government agency)\nwith contracting responsibility for a project financed with the proceeds of one\nof the five tax-favored bonds must cause or require the contracting officer for\nthe project, at least as soon as the entity receives notice of ARRA assistance\nwith respect to the project, to insert in full the standard D-B contract\nclauses found in 29 CFR 5.5(a) (and the applicable wage determination in effect\nat the time of notice of ARRA assistance) in bid solicitations and covered\nconstruction contracts that are in excess of $2,000 for construction,\nalteration or repair (including painting and decorating). The requirement to insert the standard D-B contract\nclauses and attach the applicable wage determination in effect at the time of\nnotice of ARRA assistance applies regardless of the amount or form of ARRA\nfunding or assistance. Thus, coverage under section 1601 of Division B of ARRA\ncan exist even if a project is financed only in part by proceeds of one of the\nbonds listed in section 1601. If bond proceeds are pooled in a general fund or\notherwise, then every project financed in whole or in part by the pooled\nproceeds is subject to Davis-Bacon requirements provided that other applicable\ncoverage criteria are satisfied. (b)  Weatherization contracts. Using ARRA appropriations,\nthe Department of Energy awards grants under the Weatherization Assistance\nProgram to state-level government agencies. These agencies then contract with\nlocal agencies, usually Community Action Agencies, to deliver weatherization\nservices to eligible residents. Individuals and families apply for assistance\nthrough the local agencies. If approved for services, professionally trained\nweatherization assistance program technicians perform on-site audits to identify\ncost-effective measures that can be taken. Crews then make the repairs and\nimprovements to increase energy efficiency. The technicians conducting the\naudits are typically employees of the governmental or community action agency.\nThe repair crews typically work for contractors.  It is WHD’s longstanding\nposition that governmental agencies are not contractors or subcontractors\nwithin the meaning of the DBA when the construction is performed by their own\nemployees on a “force account” basis. (See FOH 15b06.) However, laborers or\nmechanics employed by a private, non-profit Community Action Agency cannot be\nconsidered as force account labor and will be covered under the DB labor\nstandards requirements when performing ARRA-assisted weatherization work. In addition,\nwhen the Community Action Agency contracts out work that is assisted with ARRA\nfunding, the Agency must apply the DB labor standards and appropriate WD to the\ncontract. Therefore, repair crews performing the duties of laborers or\nmechanics for a Community Action Agency or its contractors must be paid at\nleast the DB prevailing wage. Certain activities such as energy audits and\ninspections are not viewed as construction work performed by laborers or\nmechanics within the meaning of the DBA. (c)   State Energy Program (SEP) and individual homeowners. DOE, through its Office of\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), operates a State Energy Program\n(SEP) that provides grants to States that may be used to fund individual\nStates’ SEP plans. These grants are funded in whole or in part by ARRA. An\nindividual homeowner who receives a rebate for material and/or labor costs he\nor she has incurred in connection with qualifying energy efficiency and\nweatherization improvements to his or her home under a DOE SEP rebate program\nis not responsible for Davis-Bacon compliance. This general interpretation\naddresses only whether Davis-Bacon labor standards apply to individual\nhomeowners who receive a rebate, funded in whole or in part by ARRA, to\nreimburse them pursuant to DOE programs for certain energy efficiency and\nweatherization improvements to their homes.","html":"<p>(a)   Davis-Bacon coverage under ARRA. </p><p>(1) \nAAM #207 outlined the\napplicability of the DB labor standards to ARRA funded projects.

All apprentices\nother than probationary apprentices must be individually registered in the\napproved program. Consistent with the level of training in the program, an\napprentice will perform for the appropriate period of time all levels of work,\nfrom the lowest unskilled laborer’s work to the highest skilled or craft work\nof the finished mechanic, under the supervision of the journeyworker. To be\nemployed in compliance with the Regulations the following guidelines must be\nobserved: (b)  Allowable ratio - apprentices to journeyworkers. (1) \nThe allowable ratio of apprentices\nto journeyworkers employed on the contract work in any craft classification\nwill not be greater than the ratio permitted the contractor as to the entire\nwork force under the registered program. (See 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i).) The\nallowable ratio is to be applied on a daily basis. If a contractor has both an\napprentice and a trainee program, the trainees must be counted together with\nthe apprentices in determining compliance with the allowable ratio (i.e., the\njourneyworkers may not be counted twice). (2) \nFor the purpose of illustration\nonly, assume that a contractor is allowed a ratio of one apprentice to every\nthree journeyworkers under the terms of the approved plan. This same ratio\nwould apply on DBRA covered jobs. Thus, in this example, the allowable number\nof apprentices is illustrated by the following chart: \n\n\n \n  \n  Journeyworkers\n  \n  \n  Allowable\n  Apprentices\n  \n \n \n  \n  0-2\n  \n  \n  0\n  \n \n \n  \n  3-5\n  \n  \n  1\n  \n \n \n  \n  6-8\n  \n  \n  2\n  \n \n \n  \n  9-11\n  \n  \n  3\n  \n \n\n\n NOTE: The ratios are applied in terms of whole number\nincrements for the journeyworkers (as reflected in the preceding chart) and not\nin terms of “fractions thereof,” unless a different standard is specified in\nthe approved plan. Also, the allowable ratio will vary from plan to plan. (3) \nRecognizing that the DBRA work may\nbe performed in a location other than the place where the program registration\nwas initially made, the allowable ratio is the ratio specified in the\ncontractor’s or subcontractor’s registered program (see 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i)). (4) \nA working supervisor or owner may\nbe counted as a journeyworker for ratio purposes provided such a worker spends\nthe majority of his or her time in the craft, at the site. (5) \nIn determining the proper ratios,\n“bootstrapping” is not allowed. For example, if an employer has employees who\nare misclassified and determined to be entitled to the journeyworker’s rate or\nhas utilized an excessive number of apprentices who are also entitled to the\njourneyworker’s rate, such employees cannot then be counted as “journeyworker”\nfor ratio purposes. (c)   Registered apprentice ratio exceeded. If a contractor or\nsubcontractor employs apprentices in such a number that the permissible ratio\nis exceeded, all apprentices employed in excess of the ratio are considered to\nhave been improperly employed and will be entitled to the rate for the\nclassification of work which they are performing. For example, if an employer\nis permitted to employ three apprentices under an approved plan and it is\ndisclosed that the employer is employing five apprentices on the project, the\nfirst three apprentices employed on the project will be considered within the\nquota; the last two employed will be considered improperly employed and must be\npaid the full prevailing wage rate for the work performed. As a practical\nmatter, if it is impossible to determine which apprentices were first employed\non the project, any equitable formula for allocating the time due at the\napplicable prevailing wage rate will be acceptable. For example, in the\npreceding situation, it would be permissible and equitable to rotate three of\nthe five apprentices each week as a solution to the problem of which of these\nemployees were “first” employed on the project. The remaining two employees\nwould then be allocated the full prevailing wage rate in a manner which\ndistributes the time improperly employed as equally as possible. (d)  Evidence of bona fide apprenticeship registration. 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(3)(i)\nrequires that a contractor or subcontractor utilizing apprentices maintain\nwritten evidence of the registration of the program and the apprentices, and of\nthe ratios and wage rates prescribed in the applicable programs. (e)   Unregistered apprentices. 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i)\nprovides that any employee listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate who\nis not a bona fide registered or probationary apprentice must be paid the wage\nrate for the classification of work actually performed. However, the fact that\na worker is listed on the payrolls as an apprentice in a particular craft and\npaid an apprentice wage rate for that craft does not, in itself, mean that\nperson performed only the work of, or used only the tools of, the craft in\nwhich the person is an unregistered apprentice, and it does not mean that the\nworker must be compensated only at the contract rate for that craft\nclassification. Such an employee may actually be performing work as a laborer\nor in another craft classification, and must receive at least the rate\napplicable for the classification(s) of work actually performed. (f)   Employment of apprentices by more than one employer. Employment of a properly\nregistered apprentice by more than one employer does not affect his/her status.\nThe transfer of apprentices from one employer to another to provide varied work\nand training is an accepted construction industry practice. (g)   Wage computations for apprentices. In some instances, bona fide\napprenticeship programs contain percentages which are applied to a stipulated\nwage rate (e.g., stated in the approved apprenticeship program or set forth in\na collective bargaining agreement), the product of which results in the wage\nrate paid to the apprentice. While such a computation is acceptable on\nconstruction projects not subject to the DBRA, the contractor on covered\nprojects is bound by any higher wage rates in the WD and the percentages should\nbe computed against the journeyworker’s basic rate found in the WD. Some\napprenticeship agreements may specify dollar amounts, rather than percentages\nof the journeyworker’s rate, for various levels of progress. For this type of\napprenticeship training program, in order to determine whether the apprentice\nis properly paid it is necessary to convert the dollar amounts to a percentage\nof the journeyworker’s basic rate in the training program. This is then applied\nto the rate specified in the WD. For example, where the journeyworker’s rate\ncontained in the apprenticeship training program for a particular craft is\n$16.00 per hour and the apprentices are to receive $8.00, $10.00, $12.00, or\n$14.00, depending on their level of progress, the percentages to be applied against\nthe journeyworker’s rate in the WD should be 50%, 63%, 75%, and 88%,\nrespectively. In addition, the apprentices are also entitled to receive fringe\nbenefits in accordance with the provisions of the apprenticeship program. If\nthe approved program is silent as to fringe benefits, apprentices must be paid\nthe full amount of fringe benefits listed in the WD for their classification,\nunless the Administrator determines that a different practice prevails in the\nlocality of the construction project for that particular apprentice\nclassification.","html":"<p>(a)   An apprentice (29 CFR § 5.2(n)(l)) is (1) any person\nemployed under a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State\napprenticeship agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor,\nEmployment and Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship Training,\nEmployer and Labor Services (OA), or if no such recognized agency exists in a\nState, under a program registered with the OA itself, or, (2) a person in the\nfirst 90 days of probationary employment as an apprentice in such an approved\napprenticeship program who is not individually registered in the program, but\nwho has been certified by OA or a State apprenticeship agency (as appropriate)\nto be eligible for probationary employment as an apprentice.

(See 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i).) The\nallowable ratio is to be applied on a daily basis. If a contractor has both an\napprentice and a trainee program, the trainees must be counted together with\nthe apprentices in determining compliance with the allowable ratio (i.e., the\njourneyworkers may not be counted twice).</p><p>(2) \nFor the purpose of illustration\nonly, assume that a contractor is allowed a ratio of one apprentice to every\nthree journeyworkers under the terms of the approved plan. This same ratio\nwould apply on DBRA covered jobs. Thus, in this example, the allowable number\nof apprentices is illustrated by the following chart:</p><div>\n\n<table>\n <tbody><tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Journeyworkers</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Allowable\n  Apprentices</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>0-2</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>0</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>3-5</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>1</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>6-8</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>2</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>9-11</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>3</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n</div><p>NOTE: The ratios are applied in terms of whole number\nincrements for the journeyworkers (as reflected in the preceding chart) and not\nin terms of “fractions thereof,” unless a different standard is specified in\nthe approved plan. Also, the allowable ratio will vary from plan to plan.</p><p>(3) \nRecognizing that the DBRA work may\nbe performed in a location other than the place where the program registration\nwas initially made, the allowable ratio is the ratio specified in the\ncontractor’s or subcontractor’s registered program (see 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i)).</p><p>(4) \nA working supervisor or owner may\nbe counted as a journeyworker for ratio purposes provided such a worker spends\nthe majority of his or her time in the craft, at the site.</p><p>(5) \nIn determining the proper ratios,\n“bootstrapping” is not allowed. For example, if an employer has employees who\nare misclassified and determined to be entitled to the journeyworker’s rate or\nhas utilized an excessive number of apprentices who are also entitled to the\njourneyworker’s rate, such employees cannot then be counted as “journeyworker”\nfor ratio purposes.</p><p>(c)   Registered apprentice ratio exceeded.</p><p>If a contractor or\nsubcontractor employs apprentices in such a number that the permissible ratio\nis exceeded, all apprentices employed in excess of the ratio are considered to\nhave been improperly employed and will be entitled to the rate for the\nclassification of work which they are performing. For example, if an employer\nis permitted to employ three apprentices under an approved plan and it is\ndisclosed that the employer is employing five apprentices on the project, the\nfirst three apprentices employed on the project will be considered within the\nquota; the last two employed will be considered improperly employed and must be\npaid the full prevailing wage rate for the work performed. As a practical\nmatter, if it is impossible to determine which apprentices were first employed\non the project, any equitable formula for allocating the time due at the\napplicable prevailing wage rate will be acceptable. For example, in the\npreceding situation, it would be permissible and equitable to rotate three of\nthe five apprentices each week as a solution to the problem of which of these\nemployees were “first” employed on the project. The remaining two employees\nwould then be allocated the full prevailing wage rate in a manner which\ndistributes the time improperly employed as equally as possible.</p><p>(d)  Evidence of bona fide apprenticeship registration.</p><p>29 CFR § 5.5(a)(3)(i)\nrequires that a contractor or subcontractor utilizing apprentices maintain\nwritten evidence of the registration of the program and the apprentices, and of\nthe ratios and wage rates prescribed in the applicable programs.</p><p>(e)   Unregistered apprentices.</p><p>29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i)\nprovides that any employee listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate who\nis not a bona fide registered or probationary apprentice must be paid the wage\nrate for the classification of work actually performed. However, the fact that\na worker is listed on the payrolls as an apprentice in a particular craft and\npaid an apprentice wage rate for that craft does not, in itself, mean that\nperson performed only the work of, or used only the tools of, the craft in\nwhich the person is an unregistered apprentice, and it does not mean that the\nworker must be compensated only at the contract rate for that craft\nclassification. Such an employee may actually be performing work as a laborer\nor in another craft classification, and must receive at least the rate\napplicable for the classification(s) of work actually performed.</p><p>(f)   Employment of apprentices by more than one employer.</p><p>Employment of a properly\nregistered apprentice by more than one employer does not affect his/her status.\nThe transfer of apprentices from one employer to another to provide varied work\nand training is an accepted construction industry practice.</p><p>(g)   Wage computations for apprentices.</p><p>In some instances, bona fide\napprenticeship programs contain percentages which are applied to a stipulated\nwage rate (e.g., stated in the approved apprenticeship program or set forth in\na collective bargaining agreement), the product of which results in the wage\nrate paid to the apprentice. While such a computation is acceptable on\nconstruction projects not subject to the DBRA, the contractor on covered\nprojects is bound by any higher wage rates in the WD and the percentages should\nbe computed against the journeyworker’s basic rate found in the WD. Some\napprenticeship agreements may specify dollar amounts, rather than percentages\nof the journeyworker’s rate, for various levels of progress. For this type of\napprenticeship training program, in order to determine whether the apprentice\nis properly paid it is necessary to convert the dollar amounts to a percentage\nof the journeyworker’s basic rate in the training program. This is then applied\nto the rate specified in the WD. For example, where the journeyworker’s rate\ncontained in the apprenticeship training program for a particular craft is\n$16.00 per hour and the apprentices are to receive $8.00, $10.00, $12.00, or\n$14.00, depending on their level of progress, the percentages to be applied against\nthe journeyworker’s rate in the WD should be 50%, 63%, 75%, and 88%,\nrespectively. In addition, the apprentices are also entitled to receive fringe\nbenefits in accordance with the provisions of the apprenticeship program. If\nthe approved program is silent as to fringe benefits, apprentices must be paid\nthe full amount of fringe benefits listed in the WD for their classification,\nunless the Administrator determines that a different practice prevails in the\nlocality of the construction project for that particular apprentice\nclassification.</p>"},{"section":"15e02","chapter":"15","section_title":"15e02 - Trainees.","text":"(a)   A trainee (29 CFR § 5.2(n)(2)) is any person who is\nreceiving on-the-job training in a construction occupation under a program\nwhich has received prior approval (or prior recognition for certain programs\nestablished prior to August 20, 1975), as evidenced by formal certification of\nthe approval (or recognition) by the Department’s Employment and Training\nAdministration (OA).

Under the DBA, there are not standard classification\ndefinitions. (This differs from SCA classifications, which are defined in the\nSCA Directory of Classifications.) Note: While the Dictionary of Occupational\nTitles, published by the Department’s Employment and Training Administration,\nmay be used as reference material, it cannot be relied on for making employee\nclassification determinations. (b)  The Wage Appeals Board ruled in Fry Brothers Corp.\n(WAB Case No. 76-6, June 14, 1977) that the proper classification of work\nperformed by laborers and mechanics is that classification used by firms whose\nwage rates were found to be prevailing in the area and incorporated in the\napplicable wage determination. Questions as to the proper classification for\nthe work performed by a laborer or mechanic are resolved by making an area\npractice survey. Area practice surveys can be conducted by the contracting\nagencies or by WHD using the following guidelines. All Agency Memorandums\n(AAMs) Nos. 130 and 131 provide guidance regarding the proper categories of the\nvarious types of construction (building, heavy, highway and residential)\nsubject to “local or area practice”. Before any area practice survey is\nstarted, the Regional Wage Specialist must be contacted. See http://www.dol.gov/whd/programs/dbra/regions.htm (c)   Basic Principles/Preliminary Steps for Conducting\nSurveys to Determine Prevailing Local Area Practice: (1) \nClearly define the scope of\nwork/duties for which proper classification is at issue. (2) \nRefer to the wage determination in\nthe DB/DBRA covered contract. (3) \nDetermine what classifications may\nperform the work duties in question. (4) \nExamine the “identifiers” for each\nclassification to determine whether the rates in the wage determination for\neach such classification reflect union negotiated or non-union wages.                                               \na.     Non-union rates in a Davis-Bacon wage determination\nare listed in a wage rate block that has an “SU” identifier, and appear in\nalphabetical order in the list of classifications in the wage determination\n(e.g,. after sheet metal workers and before truck drivers). Other wage\ndetermination blocks reflect rates in collective bargaining agreements.                                             \nb.     Union rates are listed under identifiers that refer to\nthe union whose rates are reflected in a given wage rate block in the\nDavis-Bacon wage determination. Examples are: ASBE (International Association\nof Heat & Frost & Asbestos Workers), ELEC (International Brotherhood of\nElectrical Workers), PLAS (Operative Plasters and Cement Masons), and PLUM\n(United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe\nFitting Industry of the United States and Canada). The number following in the\nidentifier usually indicates the local union number for the union that\nnegotiated the rates shown in the wage determination block. (5) \nIn accord with Fry Brothers Corp.,\ninformation to be considered in the area practice survey is from firms whose\nwage rates were found to be prevailing in the area and incorporated in the\napplicable wage determination.                                              \na.     If, in the applicable wage determination, the rates\nlisted for all the classifications that may perform the work in question are\nnon-union rates, the dispute will be resolved by examining the practice(s) of\nnon-union contractors in classifying workers performing the duties on similar\nconstruction in question in the area (usually the same county).                                             \nb.     If, in the applicable wage determination, the rates\nlisted for all the classifications that may perform the work in question are\nunion rates, the dispute will be resolved by examining the practice(s) of union\ncontractors in classifying workers performing the duties in question on similar\nconstruction in the area (usually the same county). (Often such questions can\nbe resolved by a limited area practice survey.)                                              \nc.     If a combination of union and non-union rates are\nlisted in the wage determination for classifications that may have performed\nthe work in question on similar construction in the area (usually the same\ncounty), the dispute will be resolved based on the combined information from: 1.    \nunion contractors for the\nclassification(s) for which union rate(s) are listed in the applicable wage\ndetermination; and 2.    \nnon-union contractors for the\nclassification(s) for which non-union rate(s) are listed in the applicable wage\ndetermination. (6) \nTo ensure the local area practice\nsurvey examines how workers who performed the duties in question were\nclassified when they worked on similar construction projects in the same area\nas the project in question during the survey timeframe, proper classification\nof the laborers or mechanics performing the work in question will be resolved\nby examining the classification practice(s) of contractors who performed the\nwork in question on:                                             \na.     similar construction projects – building construction,\nresidential construction, highway construction, heavy construction – (See AAM\n# 130 & 131.)                                             \nb.     that were in progress in the same area (normally the\nsame county.)                                              \nc.     during the year preceding the contract in question (as\ndiscussed below). (7) \nThe extent of the information\nrequired for making area practice determinations will depend on the facts in\neach case. For example:                                              \na.     If, in gathering preliminary data, all of the parties\nagree as to the proper classification, the area practice is thus established\n(i.e., a “limited” area practice survey).                                             \nb.     However, if all parties do not agree (i.e.,\njurisdictional dispute between two unions, or management does not agree with\nthe union, or where non-union rate(s) in the wage determination may apply and\nthe practice among non-union contractors in the area varies), it will be\nnecessary to determine by a “full” area practice survey which classification\nactually performed the work in question.                                              \nc.     The survey will collect information on how workers\nperforming the work in question were classified on similar projects underway in\nthe same locality (normally the county), during the year prior to contract\naward of the DBA/DBRA contract in question (or, in the case of contracts entered\nintopursuant to competitive bidding procedures -- as contrasted with\nnegotiation procedures -- the year prior to bid opening; in the case of\nprojects assisted under the National Housing Act, beginning of construction or\nthe date the mortgage was initially endorsed, whichever occurred first; or, in\nthe case of projects to receive housing assistance payments under section 8 of\nthe U.S. Housing Act of 1937, beginning of construction or the date the\nagreement to enter a housing assistance payments contract was executed,\nwhichever was first.) (d)  To conduct a limited area practice survey to determine\nthe proper classification of work: Follow the “preliminary\nsteps” described in 15f05(c), above. (1) \nIf the applicable wage\ndetermination reflects union rates for the classifications involved:                                              \na.     Contact the unions whose members may have performed\nthe work in question to determine whether the union workers performed the work\non similar projects in the county in the year prior to the wage determination\nlock-in date (contract award date, or other date, as described above) for the\nproject at issue.                                              \nb.     The criteria for usable data is similar projects (same\ntype of construction), in the same county as the project in question, within\nthe usable time frame of one year prior to the wage determination lock-in date\nfor the contract in question, as established by 29 CFR § 1.6(c).                                               \nc.     If union contractors performed the work, each union\nshould be asked how the individuals who performed the work in question were\nclassified. If no union workers performed any of the work in question in the\ncounty during the survey timeframe, the Regional WS should be contacted for\nfurther guidance.                                             \nd.     The information provided by the unions should be\nconfirmed with collective bargaining representatives of management, i.e., the\ncontractor representatives. These would include local chapters of contractors'\nassociations that bargain with the unions. For example: the Associated General\nContractors of America (AGC), the National Electrical Contractors Association\n(NECA), the Mechanical Contractors Association of America, etc. (Contact NO/Division\nof Wage Determinations/Branch of Construction Wage Determinations for\ninformation needed to contact the contractors’ association and the local union\nthat negotiated the collective bargaining agreement whose rates are reflected\nin the contract wage determination.)                                              \ne.     If all parties agree as to the proper classification of\nthe work in question, the area practice is established. If two unions are\nengaged in a jurisdictional dispute over a specific type of work and both have\nperformed the work in question during the applicable time period, contact\nRegional WS for further guidance. (A more extensive area practice survey will\nbe required to resolve the question.) NOTE: With regard to (2) and (3), below, it may be\nmore practical in many instances to proceed directly to a full area practice\nsurvey if calls to the contractors are needed anyway to determine whether each\ncontractor is a union or open shop contractor (see information in (4) below). (2) \nIf the applicable wage\ndetermination reflects non-union rates for the classifications involved:                                              \na.     Contact open shop contractors (many are members of the\nAssociated Builders and Contractors of America (ABC)) and ask whether they\nperformed the work in question on similar projects underway in the county\nduring the survey timeframe. (While it may not be possible to know if\ncontractors are union or open shop contractors prior to calling them, there\nwould be no need to request information from the union contractors concerning\ntheir classification practices in this case.) 1.    \nIf so, the non-union contractors\nshould be asked how the employees who performed this work were classified. 2.    \nIf all the non-union contractors\nagree, or if a clear majority of them agree, the area practice is established. 3.    \nIf no open shop contractor\nperformed the work at issue in the county during the survey timeframe, contact\nthe Regional WS for further guidance. (3) \nIf the applicable wage\ndetermination reflects a mix of union and non-union rates for the\nclassifications involved:                                              \na.     Contact the unions, and contact union and open shop\ncontractors (and/or their associations) to determine who performed the work at\nissue on similar projects during the survey timeframe. 1.    \nIf all parties agree, or if a\nclear majority of the parties (both union contractors regarding the classification\nlisted with a union rate in the wage determination and non-union contractors\nregarding the classification listed with a non-union rate in the wage\ndetermination) agree on the classification, the area practice is established. 2.    \nContact the Regional WS if no work\nof the type at issue was performed in the county during the applicable time\nframe discussed above. (4) \nFor any type of wage determination\n(whether based on union rates, non-union rates, or a mixed schedule): If the\nparties contacted in the limited area practice survey do not agree (i.e.,\njurisdictional dispute between the unions, management does not agree with union,\nor disagreement between the open shop contractors), or if there is no clear\nmajority in agreement, then it is necessary to contact the Regional WS and\nprepare to conduct a full area practice survey.(e)   How to conduct a full area practice survey to\ndetermine the proper classification of work: Follow the “preliminary steps” described in 15f05(c),\nabove. (1) \nIdentify similar projects in the same\ngeographical area as the project under investigation (usually the county) which\nwere in progress during the period one year prior to the wage determination\nlock-in date of the contract involved in the dispute/investigation. If no\nsimilar projects were built in the area during that time frame, contact the\nRegional WS for advice in expanding the survey's geographic scope and/or its\ntime frame. (Note: where data regarding the classification practices of union\ncontractors are sought in the area practice survey, it may be appropriate to\nrequest a list of contractors who may have performed the work in question from\nthe relevant union(s) and use such list(s) to contact the contractors as a way\nto identify relevant projects.) (2) \nIdentify firms that performed the work\nin question on these projects and determine those from which data should be\ncollected based on whether the relevant classifications in question in the wage\ndetermination are either non-union rates, union rates, or both. (For example, if\nonly non-union wage rates in the wage determination are involved, information\nfrom union contractors is not relevant; if only union rates are involved,\ninformation from open shop contractors is not relevant. Similarly, if the\nclassifications in the wage determination that may have performed the work in\nquestion are a mix of union and non-union rates, information from both union\nand open shop contractors will need to be collected, but data from union\ncontractors cannot be used to support the non-union rate and data from open\nshop contractors cannot be used to support the union classification rate.) (3) \nFor each project, obtain data from\nthe week in which the greatest number of employees performed the work in\nquestion, and record how many performed such work on each project and how such\nemployees were classified and paid. (4) \nCompile all relevant information\nreceived and total the number of employees who performed the work in question\nin each classification reported. The data should be tallied separately for\nunion and non-union contractors/workers – only data from union\ncontractors/workers can be counted to support a union rate listed in the\ncontract wage determination, and only data from open shop contractors can be\ncounted to support a non-union rate in the wage determination.                                              \na.     The classification which has the clear majority of\nemployees performing the work in question is the proper classification.                                             \nb.     If the data does not show that at least 60% of the\nworkers who performed the duties in question were classified in the same classification,\ncontact the Regional WS for further guidance.","html":"<p>(a)   To determine the proper classification of work\nperformed on a Davis-Bacon covered project, it may be necessary to conduct a local\narea practice survey.

For example, if an employer contributes to a hospitalization plan\non a weekly basis, the total hours worked (DBRA covered and noncovered) each\nweek by each employee should be divided into the contribution made by the\nemployer on behalf of each employee to determine the hourly cash equivalent for\nwhich the employer is entitled to take credit for each employee. If contributions\nare made biweekly, cash equivalents would be computed bi-weekly. If\ncontributions are made quarterly, cash equivalents would be computed quarterly,\netc. (b)  On occasion, a contractor or subcontractor may offset\nthe annual cost of a particular fringe benefit by converting such costs to an\nhourly cash equivalent. For example, the hourly cash equivalent may be\ndetermined by dividing the cost of the fringe benefit by the total number of\nworking hours (DBRA and noncovered) to which the cost is attributable. Total\nhours worked by employees must be used as a divisor to determine the rate of\ncontribution per hour, since employees may work on both DBRA and nongovernment\nwork during the year and employers are prohibited from using contributions made\nfor nongovernment work to discharge or offset their obligations on DBRA work\n(see FOH 15f11(b)). Note, however, that if the amount of contribution varies\nper employee, credit must be determined separately for the amount contributed\non behalf of each employee (FOH 15f11(c)). (c)   To illustrate the principles set out in (b), assume\nthat the annual cost of a pension program is $15,000. The total actual working\nhours (DBRA and nongovernment) are 15,000. Thus $15,000 / 15,000 hours = $1.00\nper hour cash equivalent. Since construction workers often do not work a full\nyear (2,080 hours), where the contractor makes annual payments in advance to cover\nthe coming year and actual hours worked will not be determinable until the\nclose of that year, the total hours worked by the DBRA-covered laborers,\nmechanics and apprentices, if any, for the preceding calendar year (or plan\nyear), will be considered as representative of a normal work year for purposes\nof the above formula. Similarly, where the contractor pays monthly health\ninsurance premiums in advance on a lump sum basis, the total actual hours\nworked in the previous month or in the same month in the previous year may be\nuse to determine (i.e., estimate) the hourly equivalent credit per employee\nduring the current month. Any representative period may be utilized in such\ncases, provided that the period selected is reasonable. Where the cost incurred\nincluded contributions for employees other than covered laborers, mechanics,\nand apprentices, the hours of such noncovered employees must be included in the\ncomputation of the hourly cash equivalent or the contributions for such\nemployees must be eliminated prior to determining the cash equivalent for\ncovered employees. (d)  In computing cash equivalents, it should be kept in\nmind that under certain kinds of fringe benefit plans the rate of contribution\nfor employees may vary. For example, under a hospitalization plan the employer\noften contributes at different rates for single and family plan members. In\nsuch situations, an employer cannot take an across the board average equivalent\nfor all employees; rather, the cash equivalent can only be credited based on\nthe rate of contributions for each individual employee.","html":"<p>(a)   In determining cash equivalent credit for fringe\nbenefit payments, the period of time to be used is the period covered by the\ncontribution. For example, if an employer contributes to a hospitalization plan\non a weekly basis, the total hours worked (DBRA covered and noncovered) each\nweek by each employee should be divided into the contribution made by the\nemployer on behalf of each employee to determine the hourly cash equivalent for\nwhich the employer is entitled to take credit for each employee. If contributions\nare made biweekly, cash equivalents would be computed bi-weekly. If\ncontributions are made quarterly, cash equivalents would be computed quarterly,\netc.</p><p>(b)  On occasion, a contractor or subcontractor may offset\nthe annual cost of a particular fringe benefit by converting such costs to an\nhourly cash equivalent. For example, the hourly cash equivalent may be\ndetermined by dividing the cost of the fringe benefit by the total number of\nworking hours (DBRA and noncovered) to which the cost is attributable. Total\nhours worked by employees must be used as a divisor to determine the rate of\ncontribution per hour, since employees may work on both DBRA and nongovernment\nwork during the year and employers are prohibited from using contributions made\nfor nongovernment work to discharge or offset their obligations on DBRA work\n(see FOH 15f11(b)). Note, however, that if the amount of contribution varies\nper employee, credit must be determined separately for the amount contributed\non behalf of each employee (FOH 15f11(c)).</p><p>(c)   To illustrate the principles set out in (b), assume\nthat the annual cost of a pension program is $15,000. The total actual working\nhours (DBRA and nongovernment) are 15,000. Thus $15,000 / 15,000 hours = $1.00\nper hour cash equivalent. Since construction workers often do not work a full\nyear (2,080 hours), where the contractor makes annual payments in advance to cover\nthe coming year and actual hours worked will not be determinable until the\nclose of that year, the total hours worked by the DBRA-covered laborers,\nmechanics and apprentices, if any, for the preceding calendar year (or plan\nyear), will be considered as representative of a normal work year for purposes\nof the above formula. Similarly, where the contractor pays monthly health\ninsurance premiums in advance on a lump sum basis, the total actual hours\nworked in the previous month or in the same month in the previous year may be\nuse to determine (i.e., estimate) the hourly equivalent credit per employee\nduring the current month. Any representative period may be utilized in such\ncases, provided that the period selected is reasonable. Where the cost incurred\nincluded contributions for employees other than covered laborers, mechanics,\nand apprentices, the hours of such noncovered employees must be included in the\ncomputation of the hourly cash equivalent or the contributions for such\nemployees must be eliminated prior to determining the cash equivalent for\ncovered employees.</p><p>(d)  In computing cash equivalents, it should be kept in\nmind that under certain kinds of fringe benefit plans the rate of contribution\nfor employees may vary. For example, under a hospitalization plan the employer\noften contributes at different rates for single and family plan members.

Although the contracting\nofficer is required in all violation cases to compute liquidated damages, the\ndecision on whether to assess the damages is made by the federal agency.\n(Liquidated damages in excess of $500 may be waived or adjusted only with the\nconcurrence of the Wage and Hour Division.)  \n\n\n \n  \n  Example:\n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  M\n  \n  \n  T\n  \n  \n  W\n  \n  \n  T\n  \n  \n  F\n  \n  \n  S\n  \n  \n  S\n  \n  \n  Total\n  \n \n \n  \n  Regular\n  Time\n  \n  \n  10\n  \n  \n  12\n  \n  \n  13\n  \n  \n  9\n  \n  \n  8\n  \n  \n  3\n  \n  \n  0\n  \n  \n  55\n  \n \n\n\n In the above example, no\novertime premium was paid.

An\nemployee would not, therefore, be disqualified for exemption in any w/w when he\nis “employed by” an exempt retail establishment at all time during the w/w even\nthough not “employed by” the same exempt establishment for the entire week.\n(See also IB 779.369(g) for the application of this principle to morticians.)</p>"},{"section":"21a07","chapter":"21","section_title":"21a07 - Incidental processing and servicing distinguished from manufacturing.","text":"(a)   Processing incidental to retail selling of goods or\nservices is not a manufacturing activity.

(See also IB\n779.317.) 21ca03 - Auto, truck, and trailer rental. (a)   An establishment engaged exclusively or nearly so in\nthe business of renting and leasing trucks or trailers to commercial and\nindustrial firms is not normally considered to be within the retail concept\nsince its services are performed in the midst of commercial transactions rather\nthan at the retail distribution level. (b)  The rental of trucks or trailers by establishments\nother than those described in (a) above may be recognized as retail. In such\ncases, if the sale of a type of truck or trailer is recognized as retail, then\nthe rental of such truck or trailer may also be recognized as retail. (See IB\n779.371.) (c)   The rental of passenger cars ordinarily is retail. In\nmaking a determination as to the status of rentals the tests set out in IB\n779.371 for the sales of such vehicles should be used. (d)  Vehicles used by rental firms in leasing and renting\noperations are ordinarily sold after the vehicles have outlived their\nusefulness for leasing or rental purposes. Such sales are included in the\nestablishment’s ADV of sales. Where the vehicles are sold to used car dealers\nfor resale, as is frequently the case, such sales are not recognized as retail. 21ca04 - Auto repairs. (a)   Repairs of cars for other garages which in turn charge\ntheir customers for the repairs are sales for resale. (b)  Repairs of cars for used car dealers, prior to their\nsale by such dealers, are sales for resale. (c)   Repairs of cars used by employees at the expense of\ntheir employers, to whom the bills are sent directly, are retail sales. (d)  Repairs on privately owned cars even though paid for\ndirectly by insurance companies are retail sales. 21ca05 - Ambulance services. See IB 779.369. This\nSection provides that an employee of a mortuary will continue to be within an\notherwise applicable Sec 13(a)(2) exemption if he devotes an insubstantial\namount of his time in the w/w (not more than 20%) in performing nonexempt\nambulance transportation activities. These same principles are equally\napplicable where nonexempt ambulance transportation activities are performed by\nemployees of other types of retail establishments, such as a garage or a\ngeneral merchandise store. 21ca06 - Apartment houses. The leasing or renting\nof space to tenants of apartment houses lacks the retail concept necessary to\nqualify an establishment as a retail or service establishment under Sec\n13(a)(2). (See IB 779.317.) The sale of leasehold interests in real property is\nnot included in the “sales of goods or services” in which a retail or service\nestablishment (as defined in Sec 13(a)(2)) must engage. Receipts from such\nleasing or rental activities are included in the ADV of the enterprise for purpose\nof amended Sec 3(s)(1). 21ca07 - Auto license plate sales by retail establishments. Some privately owned\nretail establishments operate “auto tag agencies” or “auto license bureaus” and\nsell auto license plates. The sales of auto license plates are sales to which\nthe retail concept does not apply, and the gross price of the plates is\nincluded in the ADV for purpose of Sec 13(a)(2). 21cb00 - Baby chicks. The sale of baby\nchicks for raising and reselling is a sale for resale, and furthermore is not recognized\nas a retail sale in the industry. Such sales are between the producer and the\ngrower and are far removed from the retail level of distribution. 21cb01 - Boatyards. (a)   The two types of establishments found in this industry\nare boatyards, where boats are built or large boats are repaired, and the\nmarina, which includes yacht basins, yacht clubs, and repair establishments\nwhere small boats are serviced or repaired. Both the boatyards and the marina\nusually sell boats, boat supplies, and accessories. (b)  Boatyards are not recognized as retail establishments\nin the industry and are not the type of establishment contemplated by the\nexemption. A sales analysis should never be necessary of such an establishment.\nA marina, however, is the type of establishment which is recognized as retail\nin the industry. It may qualify for the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption and its sales\nmay be analyzed. (c)   To distinguish between a boatyard and a marina note\nthe permanent physical facilities for repairing boats. Boatyards have facilities,\nsuch as a railway, for taking large boats out of the water for repairs. Marinas\ndo not have such facilities. Occasionally, a marina may utilize manpower or a\nportable crane to take a boat out of the water but this does not transform the\nmarina into a boatyard, since large boats normally cannot be taken out of the\nwater in this manner. The servicing of large boats by a marina is a retail\nservice because it is of the same general type the marina provides for small\nboats. (d)  Operations of individual establishments in this\nindustry may change. For example, a marina may, after a time, broaden out and\nacquire equipment until it has the characteristics of a boatyard even though it\nmay still retain the title of marina. Or, a boatyard may find, because of a\nchange in the nature of its customers, that it now only services small boats\nand that its railway is no longer in use. Thus, the facilities of an\nestablishment are important but not necessarily conclusive as to its status. 21cb02 - Beauty preparations and cosmetics. Sales to beauty shops\nof beauty preparations, such as creams, lotions, and rinses, which are used\nupon the persons of the beauty shops’ customers as a part of the service\nrendered, are sales for resale regardless of whether the customer is charged\nseparately for these items. 2lcc00 - Contract mail hauling. Employees performing\nactivities in connection with the hauling of mail under contract with the Post\nOffice Department are not within the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption. Such activities\nare wholly lacking in any retail concept and are not, therefore, within the\nscope of their employer’s otherwise exempt retail business. (See IB 779.308.) 21cc01 - Contract post offices. (a)   The remuneration which a contract post office receives\nfrom the government should not be included in the sales analysis. The receipts\nfrom “sales of goods or services” are the monies collected from the public for\nthe sales of stamps, money orders, and the like. Such sales are not recognized\nas retail. With reference to money orders only, the fees are counted and not\nthe money transmitted. (b)  An employee engaged in performing post office work in\nan exempt retail or service establishment is “employed by” such an\nestablishment within the meaning of IB 779.308 unless he is employed by the\nPost Office Department. If the establishment, including the contract post\noffice, meets the tests of the retail exemption, all employees employed by it\nwill be exempt. However, the employer may claim that the postal substation and\nthe retail establishment constitute separate establishments, and such a claim\nwill be allowed if the conditions for segregation contained in IB 779.305 are\nmet. (c)   An auxiliary employee of an exempt retail or service\nestablishment performing general office, custodial, maintenance, or messenger\nwork for a nonexempt contract postal station will, for enforcement purposes, be\nconsidered exempt in any w/w if no more than 20% of his time is spent in such\nwork. 21cc02 - Concrete blocks and flues. Sales of concrete\nblocks and flues may be recognized as retail sales. Such items are considered\nto be building materials and sales shall be classified as retail or nonretail\nin accordance with the principles set out in IB 779.335, 779.336, 779.355, and\nFOH 21cL00. 21cd01 - Driving schools. The retail concept\ndoes not apply to establishments engaged in the activity of selling and giving\ndriving instructions and preparing members of the public for examination given\nby the State for driver’s license.  21ce00 - Exterminating service. (a)   Exterminator service establishments may be recognized\nas retail. However, where the facilities and equipment of an establishment are\ndesigned for the service of factory or commercial buildings and are of a type\nwhich the general consuming public does not ordinarily have occasion to use,\nthe services are specialized and are not traditionally recognized as retail\nwithin the meaning of the exemption even though the firm may also,\noccasionally, render services to the general consuming public. On the other\nhand, if the exterminating facilities and equipment used in servicing\ncommercial buildings are no different from those used in servicing private\nresidences, such services may be regarded as retail. (b)  Exterminating services performed regularly and\nrepeatedly for a commercial or industrial firm under contract, covering an\nextended period of time, constitute maintenance operations and are not,\ntherefore, recognized as retail services. 21cf00 - Farm implement sales. (a)   Sales of new or used farm implements and farm\nmachinery, including such items as gardening and lawn care equipment, are\nrecognized as retail regardless of whether they are purchased by farmers or\nnon-farmers. Servicing and repair of such items, and sales of parts for them,\nare also recognized as retail. (See IB 779.371(e).) (b)  Sales of equipment such as the specialized types of\nconstruction and processing machinery set out in IB 779.371(e)(3) which are not\nnormally used in farming operations are not recognized as retail sales. (c)   Certain types of equipment, such as land levelers, may\nbe used both in construction and in farming operations. Where exemption depends\non the retail or nonretail nature of sales of such multi-purpose equipment, the\nfacts shall be obtained and submitted through channels to the RS for an\nopinion. 21cf01 - Florists’ Telegraph Delivery sales. (a)   Sales of flowers to consumers through Florists’\nTelegraph Delivery (FTD) are considered retail sales. Under the FTD\nArrangement, in order to serve retail customers who wish flowers delivered at\ndistant locations, other member florists have agreed that the flowers sold by\nthe establishment to which the customer comes will be supplied and delivered by\nan establishment in whose delivery area the recipient is located. Each member\nestablishment will both sell flowers for delivery from the stock of other\nmembers and deliver from its own stock flowers sold by them, with settlement\nmade periodically through clearing house procedures. The ADV allocable to\neither of these activities, as computed under (b) below, is counted as receipts\nfrom retail sales and/or services for purposes of the 75% test in Sec 13(a)(2). (b)  The ADV for purposes of enterprise coverage and the\napplication of Sec 13(a)(2) shall be determined as follows: Florist A takes an\norder from a customer and receives full payment ($20) for the flowers plus\n$2.00 for the telegram and service charge, a total of $22.00. The order is\ntelegraphed to florist B who delivers the flowers to the recipient. As a result\nof this transaction, florist A retains 20% of the sales price, plus the charges\n($6.00 in all) and florist B receives 80% of the sales price ($16). In such a\ncase, florist A must include the total amount received by him ($22) from the\ncustomer in his ADV; florist B must include in his ADV the total amount he or\nshe receives in the transaction ($16). If florist A is in Colorado and florist\nB in Illinois, the interstate sales for purposes of the 50% test as set out in\n(c) below would be ($22) for florist A and ($16) for florist B. In the above\nexample, florist A’s ADV would also include any additional amounts charged the\ncustomer for taxes, except that any excise taxes at the retail level which are\nseparately stated are not to be computed as part of the ADV for purposes of the\nmonetary test of Sec 3(s)(2). (c)   In any case where a florist’s establishment meets the\nstatutory definition of a “retail or service establishment” and is not part of\na covered enterprise, it is still necessary to determine for purposes of the\nSec 13(a)(2) exemption whether more than 50% of the establishment’s ADV of\nsales is made within the State. For example, florist A in Colorado receives an\norder for flowers to be delivered in Illinois; he wires the order (FTD) for\nflorist B in Illinois to deliver the flowers. The sale is an interstate sale\nfor purposes of Sec 13(a)(2), both with respect to the florist in Colorado and\nthe florist in Illinois. Also included as interstate sales for this purpose are\nsales by a florist for direct delivery by him into another State. (In\ndetermining the ADV for purpose of this test, see also (b) above.) 21cg00 - Gambling receipts. The receipts from\ngambling activities are not recognized as receipts from retail sales or\nservices. Thus, for example, employees engaged in the operation of a gambling\ncasino are not within the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption. 21cg01 - Golf shops in country clubs. In the ordinary case a\ngolf shop in a country club is not open to the public and cannot qualify for\nthe Sec 13(a)(2) exemption (see IB 779.317). However, if such a golf shop is\nopen and available to the general public as well as to club members and is a\n“distinct physical place of business” separate from other facilities and\nqualifies as an “establishment” the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption may apply if the\ntests are met. 21cg02 - Gasoline sales to truckers. Sales of gasoline at\nthe ordinary gasoline service establishment (not a truck stop) by the “tankful”\nto truckers for use in the operation of the vehicle are generally recognized as\nretail sales notwithstanding that discounts such as 2 cents per gallon are\nallowed or that the sales are made on a credit card basis. (See also IB\n779.371(c)(6).) 21cg03 - Civic and convention centers. (a)   Civic and convention centers whether publicly or\nprivately owned or operated are normally engaged primarily in the business of\nrenting space to business and civic organizations attracted to the locality. [n\norder to attract conventions such centers “sell” their capability to “house”\nbusiness meetings, trade shows, auto and boat shows, open-air exhibitions and\nmass meetings, including the directly related ancillary capabilities, i.e.,\nparking lot, recreation, eating facilities, etc. Such rental of space to\nbusiness and civic organizations constitutes a business activity lacking the\nretail concept. (See also FOH 21ca06.) (b)  The fact that independent contractors are engaged to\ncater food and beverages to the various groups and participants in activities\nheld at the Centers does not alter the nonretail character of the Centers.\nAlso, the fact that certain exemptions (e.g., Sec 13(a)(2), 13(b)(8), or 14)\nmay be applicable to employees of such independent contractors, depending upon\ncircumstances and character of the contractor’s business, does not affect the\napplicability of the Act to employees of the Center. 21ch00 - Hotels, motels, and restaurants - competitive bid sales. In determining the\napplication of the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption to hotels, motels, and restaurants,\nsales resulting from competitive bids are not considered characteristic of\nretail selling and are not generally recognized as retail. For example, certain\ncontracts for furnishing meals and/or lodging to government employees or\nmilitary personnel may be let on the basis of competitive bid procedures. (See\nIB 779.328(d).) 21ci00 - Industrial maintenance services. An organization which\ncleans air ducts, elevator shafts, air conditioning equipment, ventilating\nsystems, flues, stacks, and the like, and repairs and refills fire\nextinguishers, fireproofs drapes, decorations, show booths, and the like, and\nperforms maintenance work almost entirely for commercial or industrial\nestablishments is performing specialized services which the general consuming\npublic does not ordinarily have occasion to use. The organization is not\nengaged in activities which are traditionally recognized as retail even though\nit may also sometimes sell goods or render services to the general consuming\npublic. 21cL00 - Lumber and building materials sales to contractors or builders. (a)   The lumber and building materials determination (see\nIB 779.355) together with Sec 3(n) form the basis for determining which sales\nare not for resale and are recognized as retail in the industry. In applying\nthe tests of the lumber and building materials determination and Sec 3(n) to\nsales of materials to contractors or builders it is necessary to take into\nconsideration, also, the general principles contained in IB 779.327 - 779.329,\n779.335, and 779.336 which relate to retail and wholesale sales in general and\nsales for resale. (b)  The sale of lumber and building materials to\ncontractors or builders for residential, farm or commercial construction,\nrepair or maintenance are sales for resale unless excluded from this category\nby Sec 3(n). In order for such sales for to be excluded for the category of\n“for resale” all the tests of Sec 3(n) must be met (see IB 779.335 and\n779.336). The tests are: (1)  The goods sold must be used in residential or farm\nbuilding construction, repair, or maintenance, and (2)  The sale must be recognized as a bona fide retail sale\nin the industry. With respect to the\nfirst test contained in Sec 3(n) it is clear that sales of materials to\ncontractors for use in the construction, repair, or maintenance of apartment\nhouses, motels, churches, schools or other commercial or industrial structures\nare sales for resale. Such structures are not “residential” buildings of the\ntype contemplated by Sec 3(n). (c)   With respect to the second test of Sec 3(n), in\ndetermining whether sales of lumber and building materials are recognized as\nbona fide retail sales in the industry, it is necessary first to test such\nsales under the lumber and building materials determination. If they are not\nrecognized as retail under the principles set forth in the determination, they\nwill not meet the second test of Sec 3(n). It does not follow, however, that\nall sales recognized in the determination as retail are recognized as bona fide\nretail sales for purposes of Sec 3(n). Thus, although the determination, among\nother things, recognizes sales in other than direct carload lots as retail sales\n(see IB 779.355(b)(3)), regard must be given to the legislative history and\nWage-Hour’s position that sales of lumber to a contractor to build a whole\nresidential subdivision are not recognized as bona fide retail sales under Sec\n3(n) (see IB 779.335). There may, therefore, be certain circumstances under\nwhich sales in other than direct carload lots are not recognized as bona fide\nretail sales within the meaning of Sec 3(n). For example, some contractors\nengaged in the building of subdivisions may build only a few houses at a given\ntime, and possibly purchase materials in lot quantities sufficient to construct\nonly one house at a given time. Where such lumber sales are made pursuant to a\ncontract, agreement or understanding that the dealer is to supply the\ncontractor with all his lumber requirements for a subdivision consisting of a\nfixed or indefinite number of houses such sales would not be recognized as\nretail regardless of whether the lumber is to be delivered in small quantities\nas construction progresses or all at one time (see IB 779.328(c)).\nConsequently, such sales would not qualify for exclusion from the category of\nsales for resale under Sec 3(n). (d)  Situations may be encountered where a contractor is\nengaged in building a number of houses on scattered lots and is purchasing the\nmaterials for his own use in total amounts as great as a contractor who is\nbuilding a whole subdivision. Where, as in (c) above, the total amount of\nmaterials contemplated for delivery pursuant to a direct or indirect contract,\nagreement or understanding between the dealer and the contractor is materially\nin excess of the total quantity of goods which might reasonably be purchased by\na member of the general consuming public during the same period, under Sec 3(n)\nsuch sales would not be recognized as bona fide retail sales. Of course, in\nthose instances where a contractor is purchasing materials to build a single\nhouse only, whether or not in behalf of the home owner, such a sale may be\nrecognized as being a bona fide retail sale within the meaning of Sec 3(n). (e)   Where the retail or nonretail nature of sales to\ncontractors or builders cannot be determined on the basis of the above\nprinciples and such questions are determinative of the compliance status of the\nestablishment, the facts shall be obtained and the matter referred through\nchannels to the RS for an opinion.","html":"<p>Employees performing\nactivities in connection with the operation of an airport limousine or other\ntransportation terminal limousine service are not within the Sec 13(a)(2)\nexemption. Such activities are wholly lacking in any retail concept and are\nnot, therefore, within the scope of their employer’s otherwise exempt retail\nbusiness. (See IB 779.308.)</p><h4>21ca02 - Airports - aviation sales and services.</h4><p>There is no concept of\nretailing in the operation of an airport as such nor is the sale of aviation\nsupplies, parts, or services recognized as retail in the industry. (See also IB\n779.317.)</p><h4>21ca03 - Auto, truck, and trailer rental.</h4><p>(a)   An establishment engaged exclusively or nearly so in\nthe business of renting and leasing trucks or trailers to commercial and\nindustrial firms is not normally considered to be within the retail concept\nsince its services are performed in the midst of commercial transactions rather\nthan at the retail distribution level.</p><p>(b)  The rental of trucks or trailers by establishments\nother than those described in (a) above may be recognized as retail. In such\ncases, if the sale of a type of truck or trailer is recognized as retail, then\nthe rental of such truck or trailer may also be recognized as retail. (See IB\n779.371.)</p><p>(c)   The rental of passenger cars ordinarily is retail. In\nmaking a determination as to the status of rentals the tests set out in IB\n779.371 for the sales of such vehicles should be used.</p><p>(d)  Vehicles used by rental firms in leasing and renting\noperations are ordinarily sold after the vehicles have outlived their\nusefulness for leasing or rental purposes. Such sales are included in the\nestablishment’s ADV of sales. Where the vehicles are sold to used car dealers\nfor resale, as is frequently the case, such sales are not recognized as retail.</p><h4>21ca04 - Auto repairs.</h4><p>(a)   Repairs of cars for other garages which in turn charge\ntheir customers for the repairs are sales for resale.</p><p>(b)  Repairs of cars for used car dealers, prior to their\nsale by such dealers, are sales for resale.</p><p>(c)   Repairs of cars used by employees at the expense of\ntheir employers, to whom the bills are sent directly, are retail sales.</p><p>(d)  Repairs on privately owned cars even though paid for\ndirectly by insurance companies are retail sales.</p><h4>21ca05 - Ambulance services.</h4><p>See IB 779.369. This\nSection provides that an employee of a mortuary will continue to be within an\notherwise applicable Sec 13(a)(2) exemption if he devotes an insubstantial\namount of his time in the w/w (not more than 20%) in performing nonexempt\nambulance transportation activities. These same principles are equally\napplicable where nonexempt ambulance transportation activities are performed by\nemployees of other types of retail establishments, such as a garage or a\ngeneral merchandise store.</p><h4>21ca06 - Apartment houses.</h4><p>The leasing or renting\nof space to tenants of apartment houses lacks the retail concept necessary to\nqualify an establishment as a retail or service establishment under Sec\n13(a)(2). (See IB 779.317.) The sale of leasehold interests in real property is\nnot included in the “sales of goods or services” in which a retail or service\nestablishment (as defined in Sec 13(a)(2)) must engage. Receipts from such\nleasing or rental activities are included in the ADV of the enterprise for purpose\nof amended Sec 3(s)(1).</p><h4>21ca07 - Auto license plate sales by retail establishments.</h4><p>Some privately owned\nretail establishments operate “auto tag agencies” or “auto license bureaus” and\nsell auto license plates. The sales of auto license plates are sales to which\nthe retail concept does not apply, and the gross price of the plates is\nincluded in the ADV for purpose of Sec 13(a)(2).</p><h4>21cb00 - Baby chicks.</h4><p>The sale of baby\nchicks for raising and reselling is a sale for resale, and furthermore is not recognized\nas a retail sale in the industry. Such sales are between the producer and the\ngrower and are far removed from the retail level of distribution.</p><h4>21cb01 - Boatyards.</h4><p>(a)   The two types of establishments found in this industry\nare boatyards, where boats are built or large boats are repaired, and the\nmarina, which includes yacht basins, yacht clubs, and repair establishments\nwhere small boats are serviced or repaired. Both the boatyards and the marina\nusually sell boats, boat supplies, and accessories.</p><p>(b)  Boatyards are not recognized as retail establishments\nin the industry and are not the type of establishment contemplated by the\nexemption. A sales analysis should never be necessary of such an establishment.\nA marina, however, is the type of establishment which is recognized as retail\nin the industry. It may qualify for the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption and its sales\nmay be analyzed.</p><p>(c)   To distinguish between a boatyard and a marina note\nthe permanent physical facilities for repairing boats. Boatyards have facilities,\nsuch as a railway, for taking large boats out of the water for repairs. Marinas\ndo not have such facilities. Occasionally, a marina may utilize manpower or a\nportable crane to take a boat out of the water but this does not transform the\nmarina into a boatyard, since large boats normally cannot be taken out of the\nwater in this manner. The servicing of large boats by a marina is a retail\nservice because it is of the same general type the marina provides for small\nboats.</p><p>(d)  Operations of individual establishments in this\nindustry may change. For example, a marina may, after a time, broaden out and\nacquire equipment until it has the characteristics of a boatyard even though it\nmay still retain the title of marina. Or, a boatyard may find, because of a\nchange in the nature of its customers, that it now only services small boats\nand that its railway is no longer in use. Thus, the facilities of an\nestablishment are important but not necessarily conclusive as to its status.</p><h4>21cb02 - Beauty preparations and cosmetics.</h4><p>Sales to beauty shops\nof beauty preparations, such as creams, lotions, and rinses, which are used\nupon the persons of the beauty shops’ customers as a part of the service\nrendered, are sales for resale regardless of whether the customer is charged\nseparately for these items.</p><h4>2lcc00 - Contract mail hauling.</h4><p>Employees performing\nactivities in connection with the hauling of mail under contract with the Post\nOffice Department are not within the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption. Such activities\nare wholly lacking in any retail concept and are not, therefore, within the\nscope of their employer’s otherwise exempt retail business. (See IB 779.308.)</p><h4>21cc01 - Contract post offices.</h4><p>(a)   The remuneration which a contract post office receives\nfrom the government should not be included in the sales analysis. The receipts\nfrom “sales of goods or services” are the monies collected from the public for\nthe sales of stamps, money orders, and the like. Such sales are not recognized\nas retail. With reference to money orders only, the fees are counted and not\nthe money transmitted.</p><p>(b)  An employee engaged in performing post office work in\nan exempt retail or service establishment is “employed by” such an\nestablishment within the meaning of IB 779.308 unless he is employed by the\nPost Office Department. If the establishment, including the contract post\noffice, meets the tests of the retail exemption, all employees employed by it\nwill be exempt. However, the employer may claim that the postal substation and\nthe retail establishment constitute separate establishments, and such a claim\nwill be allowed if the conditions for segregation contained in IB 779.305 are\nmet.</p><p>(c)   An auxiliary employee of an exempt retail or service\nestablishment performing general office, custodial, maintenance, or messenger\nwork for a nonexempt contract postal station will, for enforcement purposes, be\nconsidered exempt in any w/w if no more than 20% of his time is spent in such\nwork.</p><h4>21cc02 - Concrete blocks and flues.</h4><p>Sales of concrete\nblocks and flues may be recognized as retail sales. Such items are considered\nto be building materials and sales shall be classified as retail or nonretail\nin accordance with the principles set out in IB 779.335, 779.336, 779.355, and\nFOH 21cL00.</p><h4>21cd01 - Driving schools.</h4><p>The retail concept\ndoes not apply to establishments engaged in the activity of selling and giving\ndriving instructions and preparing members of the public for examination given\nby the State for driver’s license.</p><h4>21ce00 - Exterminating service.</h4><p>(a)   Exterminator service establishments may be recognized\nas retail.

If florist A is in Colorado and florist\nB in Illinois, the interstate sales for purposes of the 50% test as set out in\n(c) below would be ($22) for florist A and ($16) for florist B. In the above\nexample, florist A’s ADV would also include any additional amounts charged the\ncustomer for taxes, except that any excise taxes at the retail level which are\nseparately stated are not to be computed as part of the ADV for purposes of the\nmonetary test of Sec 3(s)(2).</p><p>(c)   In any case where a florist’s establishment meets the\nstatutory definition of a “retail or service establishment” and is not part of\na covered enterprise, it is still necessary to determine for purposes of the\nSec 13(a)(2) exemption whether more than 50% of the establishment’s ADV of\nsales is made within the State. For example, florist A in Colorado receives an\norder for flowers to be delivered in Illinois; he wires the order (FTD) for\nflorist B in Illinois to deliver the flowers.

The tests are:</p><p>(1)  The goods sold must be used in residential or farm\nbuilding construction, repair, or maintenance, and</p><p>(2)  The sale must be recognized as a bona fide retail sale\nin the industry.</p><p>With respect to the\nfirst test contained in Sec 3(n) it is clear that sales of materials to\ncontractors for use in the construction, repair, or maintenance of apartment\nhouses, motels, churches, schools or other commercial or industrial structures\nare sales for resale. Such structures are not “residential” buildings of the\ntype contemplated by Sec 3(n).</p><p>(c)   With respect to the second test of Sec 3(n), in\ndetermining whether sales of lumber and building materials are recognized as\nbona fide retail sales in the industry, it is necessary first to test such\nsales under the lumber and building materials determination. If they are not\nrecognized as retail under the principles set forth in the determination, they\nwill not meet the second test of Sec 3(n). It does not follow, however, that\nall sales recognized in the determination as retail are recognized as bona fide\nretail sales for purposes of Sec 3(n). Thus, although the determination, among\nother things, recognizes sales in other than direct carload lots as retail sales\n(see IB 779.355(b)(3)), regard must be given to the legislative history and\nWage-Hour’s position that sales of lumber to a contractor to build a whole\nresidential subdivision are not recognized as bona fide retail sales under Sec\n3(n) (see IB 779.335). There may, therefore, be certain circumstances under\nwhich sales in other than direct carload lots are not recognized as bona fide\nretail sales within the meaning of Sec 3(n). For example, some contractors\nengaged in the building of subdivisions may build only a few houses at a given\ntime, and possibly purchase materials in lot quantities sufficient to construct\nonly one house at a given time. Where such lumber sales are made pursuant to a\ncontract, agreement or understanding that the dealer is to supply the\ncontractor with all his lumber requirements for a subdivision consisting of a\nfixed or indefinite number of houses such sales would not be recognized as\nretail regardless of whether the lumber is to be delivered in small quantities\nas construction progresses or all at one time (see IB 779.328(c)).\nConsequently, such sales would not qualify for exclusion from the category of\nsales for resale under Sec 3(n).</p><p>(d)  Situations may be encountered where a contractor is\nengaged in building a number of houses on scattered lots and is purchasing the\nmaterials for his own use in total amounts as great as a contractor who is\nbuilding a whole subdivision. Where, as in (c) above, the total amount of\nmaterials contemplated for delivery pursuant to a direct or indirect contract,\nagreement or understanding between the dealer and the contractor is materially\nin excess of the total quantity of goods which might reasonably be purchased by\na member of the general consuming public during the same period, under Sec 3(n)\nsuch sales would not be recognized as bona fide retail sales. Of course, in\nthose instances where a contractor is purchasing materials to build a single\nhouse only, whether or not in behalf of the home owner, such a sale may be\nrecognized as being a bona fide retail sale within the meaning of Sec 3(n).</p><p>(e)   Where the retail or nonretail nature of sales to\ncontractors or builders cannot be determined on the basis of the above\nprinciples and such questions are determinative of the compliance status of the\nestablishment, the facts shall be obtained and the matter referred through\nchannels to the RS for an opinion.</p>"},{"section":"21d00","chapter":"21","section_title":"21d00 - General provisions and IB 779.","text":"(a)   Sec 13(a)(4) provides an exemption from Secs 6 and 7\nof the Act for any employee employed by an establishment which qualifies as an\nexempt retail establishment under Sec 13(a)(2) of the Act and is recognized as\na retail establishment in the particular industry notwithstanding that such\nestablishment makes or processes at the retail establishment the goods that it\nsells: Provided, That more than 85 percentum of such establishment’s annual\ndollar volume of sales of goods so made or processed is made within the State\nin which the establishment is located. (b)  IB 779.345 through 779.350 set forth Wage-Hour’s\nposition regarding the applicability of Sec 13(a)(4).","html":"<p>(a)   Sec 13(a)(4) provides an exemption from Secs 6 and 7\nof the Act for any employee employed by an establishment which qualifies as an\nexempt retail establishment under Sec 13(a)(2) of the Act and is recognized as\na retail establishment in the particular industry notwithstanding that such\nestablishment makes or processes at the retail establishment the goods that it\nsells: Provided, That more than 85 percentum of such establishment’s annual\ndollar volume of sales of goods so made or processed is made within the State\nin which the establishment is located.</p><p>(b)  IB 779.345 through 779.350 set forth Wage-Hour’s\nposition regarding the applicability of Sec 13(a)(4).</p>"},{"section":"21d01","chapter":"21","section_title":"21d01 - Where FLSA Sec 13(a)(4) exemption is inapplicable.","text":"(a)   Where an establishment meets the requirements of the\nSec 13(a)(2) exemption, but fails to meet the additional requirements provided\nunder Sec 13(a)(4), all employees employed by the establishment, other than\nemployees engaged in the making or processing activities, will be exempt under\nSec 13(a)(2).

The AAs are responsible for purchasing\nthe property by negotiating with the property owners, analyzing property\nappraisals, and making recommendations to the client using real estate\npractices, legal concepts, governmental standards, and regulations. The AAs\nrepresent the client in negotiations with the property owners and attorneys.\nThey regularly recommend to the client whether a reasonable compromise is\nlikely and further negotiations should be pursued, or whether to pursue\ncondemnation litigation. If the property owner has a legitimate basis for\nseeking a substantially higher amount, the employees can recommend such\nincreases to the client. If the negotiation process fails, the AAs prepare the\nlawsuit packages for condemnation proceedings, assist the client’s attorney,\nand serve as an expert witness in mediation or trial. The AAs are also\nresponsible for preparing for the real estate closing, including preparing\nclosing documents.  When\nthe duties performed are those described above, the Acquisition Agents qualify\nfor the administrative exemption. The type of work performed by the AAs is\ndirectly related to the general business operations of the employer’s clients.\nAs noted in 29 CFR § 541.201(b), work in the functional areas of purchasing,\nprocurement, and legal and regulatory compliance qualifies as work that is\ndirectly related to management or general business operations. Additionally,\nthe many responsibilities of the AAs meet the discretion and independent\njudgment standard. The AAs interpret management policies, negotiate, consult\nwith and provide expert advice to management, and bind the client financially\non significant matters, as discussed in several of the factors found in 29 CFR\n§ 541.202(b). Furthermore, the AAs are similar to the insurance claims adjusters\nlisted as exempt in 29 CFR § 541.203, because they are responsible for\ninspecting and determining the value of property including unique real\nproperty, negotiating settlements, and making recommendations regarding\nlitigation when necessary.  (b)  \nRelocation Agents.  Relocation\nAgents (RAs) assist in property appraisal and provide relocation assistance to\nthe owners and tenants of the property purchased by the client. The RAs\nevaluate possible replacement properties and make recommendations as to the\namount of the “replacement housing payment” to be paid to the displaced\nproperty owner. The RAs conduct research and analyze the best options for the\nproperty owners. They also analyze possible alternative properties under\nfederal law. The RAs provide advice to the property owner on the moving process\nand any relocation assistance that might be available to them. The RAs can also\nmake recommendations to the client to offer additional payments to the property\nowner or to extend the occupancy period given to the displaced property owner.\nThey represent the client in appeals of the relocation payment amount, serving\nas expert witnesses in administrative appeals and/or in litigation. Where the\ntenant of the property is a business, the proceedings can be especially\ncomplicated because there often is tenant-installed equipment or machinery\nand/or significant build-outs by the tenant. In such cases, the relocation\nbenefits can be as much as a million dollars, and RAs have saved clients\nhundreds of thousands of dollars at a time in appeals of business relocation\npayments. The RAs also assist the property owner in preparations for the\nproperty closing.  When\nthe duties performed are those described above, the Relocation Agents qualify\nfor the administrative exemption. The type of work performed by the RAs is\ndirectly related to the general business operations of the employer’s clients.\nLike the AAs, the RAs work in the functional areas of procurement, government\nrelations, and legal and regulatory compliance, which are management and\ngeneral business operations functions. See 29 CFR § 541.201(a). The RAs\nexercise discretion and independent judgment as to significant matters by\nanalyzing housing alternatives, recommending “replacement housing payments,”\nand advising the client on significant financial matters. See 29 CFR\n§ 541.202(b). The RAs are also similar to the insurance claims adjusters\nlisted as exempt in 29 CFR § 541.203 because they are responsible for\ninspecting property, evaluating and making recommendations regarding the\n“replacement housing payment,” negotiating settlements with property owners,\nand representing management in any appeals.  (c)  \nProperty Management Agents.  The\nProperty Management Agents (PMAs) serve as spokespersons and representatives of\nthe client. They are responsible for dealing with governmental authorities,\nutility companies, contractors and other consultants during the conversion of\nthe property for public use. They are responsible for contacting and developing\nrapport with various local officials and explaining the project in order to\ndevelop good relationships and ensure compliance with the law. Additionally,\nthey must protect the client’s investment by working with the officials to keep\nthe property safe from possible vandals and by making police reports in the\nevent of vandalism. The PMAs work with environmental consultants to address\nenvironmental issues such as the presence of asbestos and to ensure compliance\nwith environmental protection laws. The PMAs coordinate all of their work and\ndevelop an Operations and Maintenance Plan to ensure that the consultants and\ncontractors follow proper procedures. The PMAs also coordinate and direct the\ndemolition of the property, including preparing detailed specifications prior\nto the bidding, advertising for bids, and conducting pre-bid meetings to explain\nthe project prior to accepting bids for the demolition work. They have\nauthority to use their knowledge and experience with contractors to select\npreferred contractors from an approved list or to shop for the best price for\nthe work. After selection, the PMAs oversee and evaluate the work of all\ncontractors. When\nthe duties performed are those described above, the Property Management Agents\nare exempt administrative employees. A PMA’s primary duty of serving as a\nliaison between the client and various government agencies qualifies as\nmanagement and general business operations because it involves government\nrelations and legal and regulatory compliance. In addition, their work during\nthe bid process and in the selection of contractors relates to purchasing and\nprocurement, and their oversight activities involve quality control.

Such duties as providing the extensive\nrecommendations and advice noted above to faculty and staff that are usually\nimplemented satisfy one of the regulatory factors in 29 CFR § 541.202(b)\nfor determining whether an employee exercises discretion and independent\njudgment with respect to matters of significance, specifically, that the\n“employee provide consultation or expert advice to management.” In addition, by\nserving as a liaison/facilitator between the school system and local law\nenforcement agencies to coordinate the law enforcement efforts of the local\njurisdiction relative to the schools, and to develop a communication network\nbetween administration, staff, students, and parents within the cluster\nschools, the SRO formulates and implements management policies or operating\npractices. See 29 CFR § 541.202(b). See FOH 22i00.</p><p>WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2007-08 </p>"},{"section":"22i45","chapter":"22","section_title":"22i45.

Assuming that the establishment\ntests are met, it is thus necessary to determine whether the employee’s duties\nare in fact those of a salesman, partsman, or mechanic (or some combination of\nthese duties where appropriate), and, if so, whether he is primarily engaged in\nselling or servicing the named vehicles, farm implements or aircraft. The\nexemption applies on a w/w basis. It is not pertinent that such salesmen,\npartsmen, or mechanics are individually engaged in selling to or servicing the\nnamed product primarily for the “ultimate purchaser”; it is only necessary for\nthe establishment to be primarily so engaged for the exemption to be applicable\n(see FOH 24L08). (b)   In determining whether an employee is in\nfact a salesman, partsman, or mechanic, a primary duty test shall be applied.\nThus, for example, an employee to be classified as a “mechanic” must spend more\nthan 50% of his time in performing the duties of a mechanic, with respect to\nthe named vehicles, farm implements, or aircraft, including duties which are\nincidental thereto. (For purposes of applying the primary duty test, all the\nduties of an employee as a salesman, partsman, or mechanic may be combined.) (c)   Partsman. The term “partsman”, as used in Sec\n13(b)(10), means an employee whose primary duty is to requisition, stock, and\ndispense parts for the named vehicles, farm implements or aircraft to be used\nby the establishment’s employees, or to sell or dispense such parts to the\nestablishment’s customers (see IB 779. 372(c)(3)). This includes incidental\nclerical duties involved in such work, and keeping the stockroom, bins, and\nshelves in order. (See also subpart (e) of this Sec.) (d)   Mechanic. (See IB 779.372(c)(3).) The term\n“mechanic”, as used in Sec 13 (b)(10), generally describes an employee whose\nprimary duty is to perform mechanical work on a named vehicle, farm implement,\nor aircraft to place it in proper operating condition by making any necessary\nadjustments or repairs. This includes an employee doing mechanical work such as\n“get ready” mechanics, automotive, truck, trailer, farm implement or aircraft\nmechanics, body or fender mechanics, used car reconditioning mechanics, and\nwrecker mechanics. Work of the following types is not in itself considered\nmechanical work for purposes of the primary duty test in applying Sec 13(b)(10)\neven though performed on a named vehicle, farm implement or aircraft: (1) \nwashing, cleaning or\npolishing (2) \nlubricating (3) \npacking wheel\nbearings (4) \nchanging oil and oil\nfilters (5) \nchanging tires (6) \npainting (7) \ncarpentry (8) \ndispatching (9) \ninstalling or\nrepairing seat covers (10) \nchecking, servicing,\nor repairing the plumbing, electrical, and butane gas systems, the doors,\nwindows and other structural features of mobile home trailers (as opposed to\nthe running mechanisms, such as wheels axles, brakes, hitches, and signal\nlights). However,\nsuch work may be performed in some instances by an employee as an incident to\nmechanical work and would be included as the work of a “mechanic” in applying\nthe primary duty test. For example, an automotive repairman may install ball\njoints or tie rods on the “front end” of a truck or automobile and lubricate\nthe repaired parts when he has finished; he may replace a broken piston and in\nthe process change oil and install a new oil filter; or he may replace a wheel\nbearing and at the same time repack it with the necessary lubricant. (e)   Parts chaser. A “parts chaser” whose primary duty is\nthat of a messenger to pick up needed parts, as directed, from the warehouse\nand from other dealers is not exempt under Sec 13(b)(10) as a “partsman”. On\nthe other hand, if the primary duty of such an employee is to see to the\nadequacy of the stock on hand and to procure necessary stock, to make billings,\nand to clean parts for return to the factory under warranty replacement, he\nwould be considered a “partsman” for purposes of the exemption. (f)   Mechanic - irrigation systems. Farm implement dealers who sell or\nservice irrigation systems and component parts (see FOH 24L07) may have\nemployees engaged in repairing such items or in cutting, fitting, and tailoring\nat the shop the items sold, to meet the needs of a particular farming\noperation. Such activities are considered to be those performed by a “mechanic”\nas the term is used in Sec 13(b)(10). Employees engaged in assembly of an\nirrigation system or components in the field (after repairs have been made or\nthe cutting, fitting and tailoring at the shop has been done) are not\nperforming the work of a “mechanic” to whom the exemption is intended to apply.\nThe possibility of exemption under Sec 13(a)(6) or Sec 13(b)(12) should not be\noverlooked. (g)   Trimmers. Some automobile dealers employ persons\ncalled “trimmers”. The following are examples of duties performed by trimmers\nwhich are considered mechanical work for purposes of the 50% test of section\n13(b)(l0): repairing the cranking mechanism of car window; repairing interior\nof doors and roofs of cars; repairing windshield wiper mechanisms; and repairing\nchrome strips around door frames. (h)  Diagnosticians and inspectors. Employees variously described as\ndiagnosticians and inspectors may be considered as being akin to service\nwriters.

Assuming that the establishment\ntests are met, it is thus necessary to determine whether the employee’s duties\nare in fact those of a salesman, partsman, or mechanic (or some combination of\nthese duties where appropriate), and, if so, whether he is primarily engaged in\nselling or servicing the named vehicles, farm implements or aircraft. The\nexemption applies on a w/w basis. It is not pertinent that such salesmen,\npartsmen, or mechanics are individually engaged in selling to or servicing the\nnamed product primarily for the “ultimate purchaser”; it is only necessary for\nthe establishment to be primarily so engaged for the exemption to be applicable\n(see FOH 24L08).</p><p>(b)   In determining whether an employee is in\nfact a salesman, partsman, or mechanic, a primary duty test shall be applied.\nThus, for example, an employee to be classified as a “mechanic” must spend more\nthan 50% of his time in performing the duties of a mechanic, with respect to\nthe named vehicles, farm implements, or aircraft, including duties which are\nincidental thereto. (For purposes of applying the primary duty test, all the\nduties of an employee as a salesman, partsman, or mechanic may be combined.)</p><p>(c)   Partsman.</p><p>The term “partsman”, as used in Sec\n13(b)(10), means an employee whose primary duty is to requisition, stock, and\ndispense parts for the named vehicles, farm implements or aircraft to be used\nby the establishment’s employees, or to sell or dispense such parts to the\nestablishment’s customers (see IB 779. 372(c)(3)). This includes incidental\nclerical duties involved in such work, and keeping the stockroom, bins, and\nshelves in order. (See also subpart (e) of this Sec.)</p><p>(d)   Mechanic.</p><p>(See IB 779.372(c)(3).) The term\n“mechanic”, as used in Sec 13 (b)(10), generally describes an employee whose\nprimary duty is to perform mechanical work on a named vehicle, farm implement,\nor aircraft to place it in proper operating condition by making any necessary\nadjustments or repairs. This includes an employee doing mechanical work such as\n“get ready” mechanics, automotive, truck, trailer, farm implement or aircraft\nmechanics, body or fender mechanics, used car reconditioning mechanics, and\nwrecker mechanics. Work of the following types is not in itself considered\nmechanical work for purposes of the primary duty test in applying Sec 13(b)(10)\neven though performed on a named vehicle, farm implement or aircraft:</p><p>(1) \nwashing, cleaning or\npolishing</p><p>(2) \nlubricating</p><p>(3) \npacking wheel\nbearings</p><p>(4) \nchanging oil and oil\nfilters</p><p>(5) \nchanging tires</p><p>(6) \npainting</p><p>(7) \ncarpentry</p><p>(8) \ndispatching</p><p>(9) \ninstalling or\nrepairing seat covers</p><p>(10) \nchecking, servicing,\nor repairing the plumbing, electrical, and butane gas systems, the doors,\nwindows and other structural features of mobile home trailers (as opposed to\nthe running mechanisms, such as wheels axles, brakes, hitches, and signal\nlights).</p><p>However,\nsuch work may be performed in some instances by an employee as an incident to\nmechanical work and would be included as the work of a “mechanic” in applying\nthe primary duty test. For example, an automotive repairman may install ball\njoints or tie rods on the “front end” of a truck or automobile and lubricate\nthe repaired parts when he has finished; he may replace a broken piston and in\nthe process change oil and install a new oil filter; or he may replace a wheel\nbearing and at the same time repack it with the necessary lubricant.</p><p>(e)   Parts chaser.</p><p>A “parts chaser” whose primary duty is\nthat of a messenger to pick up needed parts, as directed, from the warehouse\nand from other dealers is not exempt under Sec 13(b)(10) as a “partsman”. On\nthe other hand, if the primary duty of such an employee is to see to the\nadequacy of the stock on hand and to procure necessary stock, to make billings,\nand to clean parts for return to the factory under warranty replacement, he\nwould be considered a “partsman” for purposes of the exemption.</p><p>(f)   Mechanic - irrigation systems.</p><p>Farm implement dealers who sell or\nservice irrigation systems and component parts (see FOH 24L07) may have\nemployees engaged in repairing such items or in cutting, fitting, and tailoring\nat the shop the items sold, to meet the needs of a particular farming\noperation. Such activities are considered to be those performed by a “mechanic”\nas the term is used in Sec 13(b)(10). Employees engaged in assembly of an\nirrigation system or components in the field (after repairs have been made or\nthe cutting, fitting and tailoring at the shop has been done) are not\nperforming the work of a “mechanic” to whom the exemption is intended to apply.\nThe possibility of exemption under Sec 13(a)(6) or Sec 13(b)(12) should not be\noverlooked.</p><p>(g)   Trimmers.</p><p>Some automobile dealers employ persons\ncalled “trimmers”. The following are examples of duties performed by trimmers\nwhich are considered mechanical work for purposes of the 50% test of section\n13(b)(l0): repairing the cranking mechanism of car window; repairing interior\nof doors and roofs of cars; repairing windshield wiper mechanisms; and repairing\nchrome strips around door frames.</p><p>(h)  Diagnosticians and inspectors.</p><p>Employees variously described as\ndiagnosticians and inspectors may be considered as being akin to service\nwriters. (See IB 779.372(c).) Such employees may use machines and also do visual\ninspections to note the condition of a vehicle, and indicate the parts and\nservices necessary for repairs. Diagnosing and inspecting in and of itself, as\nwould be the case for example when diagnostic and inspection work is done for\nother mechanics would not be exempt. However, where an employee is a mechanic\nand is working as a mechanic and part of his employment is diagnosing and\ninspecting the vehicle before doing the actual repair, such diagnostic and\ninspection work is part of his exempt work.</p><p>(i)    Job comparison - old Sec 13(b)(10) and\nnew 13(b)(l0).</p><div>\n\n<table>\n <tbody><tr>\n  <td>\n  <p><b>Job</b></p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p><b>Vehicle</b></p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p><b>Prior\n  to 5/1/74 – Old - 13(b)(10)</b></p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p><b>Beginning\n  5/1/74 – New - 13(b)(10)</b></p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Salesman</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Automobiles</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Salesman</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Trailers</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Salesman</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Trucks</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Salesman</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Farm\n  implements</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Salesman</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Aircraft</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Salesman</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Boats</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>No</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p> </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Partsman</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Automobile</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Partsman</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Trailers</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>No</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Partsman</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Trucks</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Partsman</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Farm Implements</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Partsman</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Aircraft</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>No</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Partsman</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Boats</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>No</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>No</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p> </p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p> </p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p> </p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p> </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Mechanic</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Automobiles</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Mechanic</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Trailers</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>No</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>No</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Mechanic</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Trucks</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Mechanic</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Farm Implements</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Yes</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Mechanic</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Aircraft</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>No</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>No</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>Mechanic</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>Boats</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>No</p>\n  </td>\n  <td>\n  <p>No</p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n</div><p>(j)    Enforcement policy for period prior to\n5/1/74.</p><p>Wage-Hour takes no position with respect\nto alleged OT violations in any current investigation during the period prior\nto 5/1/74 where the employee, e.g., boat salesman, is entitled to the OT\nexemption on the basis of new Sec 13(b)(10) but would have been subject to OT\npreviously.</p><p>FOH INSERT 1757 (Rev No. 663) 5-3-2011 –\nremoved 24L04(k)</p>"},{"section":"24L05","chapter":"24","section_title":"24L05  Auto rebuilding establishment.","text":"An establishment engaged in auto\nrebuilding, such as rebuilding auto engines or transmissions, is not considered\na nonmanufacturing establishment for purposes of Sec 13(b)(10).

However, as stated in IB\n782.7(b)(2), the DOT has held that transportation confined to points in a\nsingle State from a storage terminal of commodities which have had a prior\nmovement by rail, pipeline, motor, or water from an origin in a different State\nis not in interstate commerce within the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act if the\nshipper has no fixed and persisting transportation intent beyond the terminal\nstorage point at the time of the shipment. It has been specifically found that\nthere is no fixed and persisting intent where the following three conditions\nare present: (1) \nAt the time of\nshipment there is no specific order being filled for a specific quantity of a\ngiven product to be moved through to a specific destination; (2) \nThe terminal storage\nis a distribution point or local marketing facility from which specific amounts\nof the product are sold or allocated; and (3) \nTransportation in the\nfurtherance of this distribution within the single State is specifically\narranged only after sale or allocation from storage. The\nterm “fixed and persisting transportation intent” as used by the DOT refers to\nthe intent of the shipper of the commodities into the State, who may or may not\nalso be the importer. If in applying the tests set out in (1) through (3) above\nit is determined that there was no such intent on the part of the shipper, the\ninterstate movement of the commod­ities under the Motor Carrier Act ends with\ndelivery to a terminal storage facility even where a “practical continuity of\nmovement” through the terminal (Jacksonville Paper rule) makes the subsequent\nmovement of all or part of the commodities from terminal storage to a\ndestination in the same State a part of their movement in interstate commerce\nunder the FLSA. Thus, in situations where the three tests are in fact met, as\nhas been found to be true with respect to movement of petroleum products\nthrough pipeline and water terminals, such a subsequent movement would be\nconsidered a separate intrastate movement under the Motor Carrier Act even\nthough the importer ordered the out-of-State goods in anticipation of the needs\nof a stable group of specified customers, or to meet the needs of particular\ncustomers pursuant to an understanding with them, or to fill previously\nreceived orders of his customers. However, these facts which demonstrate a\n“practical continuity of movement” under FLSA may, in par­ticular cases, also demonstrate\nthat one or more of the three DOT condi­tions are not met, and must be\ncarefully examined with this in mind in any situation in which the application\nof the tests to the facts present in such situation has not specifically been\ndetermined by the DOT. (b)   In some situations the shipper is also\nthe importer, as would be the case where a manufacturer, such as a bakery,\nproduces goods in one State and moves them through his distribution point in\nanother State to his cus­tomers in that State. The employer, as the shipper,\nknows at the time of the shipment what he intends to do with the goods after\nthey reach his out-of-State distribution point. If, as would normally be the\ncase, there is a “practical continuity of movement” of the out-of-State goods\nthrough the firm’s distribution point to its customers, this is sufficient to\nestablish a “fixed and persisting transportation intent” beyond the\ndistribution point for purposes of applying Sec 13(b)(1). (c)   Transportation within a single State of\npetroleum products from pipeline or water terminals, as ordinarily performed,\nhas specifically been held by the DOT to be in intrastate rather than\ninterstate commerce within the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act.

The Sec 13(b)(l) exemption applies to the drivers, drivers’\nhelpers, loaders and mechanics concerned with such transportation. This has\nbeen established in the courts and the DOT determination in paragraph (a) above\nhas no application. The situation of the chain store warehouse differs in\nessential respects from that of the terminals considered by the DOT in its\ndecision. As the courts have uniformly held, the situation in the chain store\ncases is one where goods are shipped from one State and briefly ware­housed in\nanother for the convenience of the owner in making an efficient distribution of\nthose goods to its local retail outlets. All goods ordered from other States\nfor delivery to the warehouse are ordered to supply the needs of the retail\nstores, and the shipper will know or can be presumed to know that these stores\nare the ultimate destination of the goods shipped.

This salesperson has also been\npaid in compliance with FLSA. Commissions earned but not paid on the next pay\n(settlement) date which are in excess of the amount required to satisfy MW\nrequirements may be carried forward and applied to the MW on subsequent pay\n(settlement) dates.                                              \nc.     The\ncircumstances are the same as in a. above, except that the salesperson has\nearned only $500 in commissions and is paid an additional $170 at the end of\nthe pay (settlement) period to meet the total MW ($3.35 x 200 - $670) due for\nthe hours worked during that month or pay period.

Salary or wage costs, as distinguished from material or\nsupply costs, may be claimed only to the extent that such salary or wage costs\nare shown to be directly attributable to the cost of providing meals to\nemployees. If food preparation/serving employees of a food service\nestablishment would be paid the same rate of pay even if meals were not\nprovided to the employees of the establishment, their wage costs cannot be\nincluded in determining reasonable cost. Conversely, if it were necessary to\nhire extra personnel or pay higher wages to existing employees in order for\nthem to assist in furnishing meals to employees, such extra expense would be a\nlegitimate cost which could be included in determining the “reasonable cost” of\nmeals. (2)  Costs which a\nfood service employer incurs regardless of whether the employees were furnished\nmeals may not be included in determining the “reasonable cost.” In a food\nservice establishment, items such as employee insurance, payroll taxes, menus,\ndecorations, other operating supplies, laundry, telephone, maintenance\nservices, advertising and promotion, building and equipment rental, licenses\nand taxes, insurance and depreciation, franchise cost, and general\nadministrative costs are a part of the overall cost of the operation of the\nemployer’s business establishment which may not be charged to the reasonable\ncost of employees’ meals. (b)   Meals -\nNon food service establishments Determination of the “reasonable cost” of meals\nfurnished to employees of an establishment which is not a food service\nestablishment involve different criteria for expenses for which an employer may\ntake credit. For example, where meals are provided to employees of a non\nfood-service establishment by a catering service and there are no special\nfacilities wherein meals are consumed, the actual cost of the catering service,\nassuming no rebate to the employer, would be the “reasonable cost.” In more\ncomplex situations where dining areas are provided, the factors discussed in\n(a) above must be considered in making a determination of the “reasonable cost”\nof meals furnished to employees of a non food-service establishment. (c)   Lodging Employers taking credit for housing as part of\nwages must show that the amounts charged are not more than the actual cost to\nthe employer. (See Reg 531.3(a).) However, if the actual cost of providing\nlodging is more than its established rental value, the rental value shall be\ndeemed to be the reasonable cost of lodging. (See FOH 30c07.) The actual cost\nto the employer generally involves the following factors: (1)  Adequate\nDepreciation. Reg 531.3(c) allows\nan employer to include “adequate depreciation” as an element of cost.\nDepreciation is a concept primarily used in and extensively regulated under the\ntax laws. Depreciation is applicable to certain capital goods (e.g. buildings,\nvehicles, machines, etc.). It is never applicable to land. For purposes of Reg\n531 “adequate depreciation” is not more than the amount of depreciation\nactually claimed and allowed under the tax laws for the property in question\nfor the period in question. It should be noted that the amount of depreciation\nallowable on any property may vary from year to year. If the employer declines\nto provide tax returns or similar evidence as to the claim and allowance of\ndepreciation under the tax laws, no allowance will be made under Reg 531.3(c).                                              \na.     For\ntax purposes, depreciation might be claimed under several line items for\nproperty involved in the furnishing of a facility. For example, an employer\nfurnishing lodging might properly claim the depreciation of the building at one\nplace; the depreciation of the beds at another; and the depreciation of linens\nat another. The addition of several such items of depreciation could be\nappropriate. Similarly, an employer might claim, in a single line item,\ndepreciation on a greater piece of property than is involved in furnishing the\nfacility in question. For example, the owner of a 20 unit motel who furnishes\none unit for the lodging of an employee might claim depreciation on the entire\nmotel building as a single line item. Under these circumstances, pro rata\nallocation of the claimed depreciation would be required. In the example,\nassuming no complications (e.g. no part of building used for other proposes;\nall units equal size, etc.), the allowable depreciation would be 1/20 = 5\npercent of the total depreciation taken.                                              \nb.     For\ntax purposes, depreciation is claimed by the year and can be prorated as\nappropriate. (2)  Capital\nInvested. The computation of “a\nreasonable allowance (not more than 5 1/2 percent) for interest on the\ndepreciated amount of capital invested by the employer” (as referred to in Reg\n531.3(c)) is made as follows: Step 1: An amount, V,\nrepresents the total depreciable value of the property to the employer. (See\n(1) above. This number is not derived from or necessarily related to “fair\nmarket value”.) Ordinarily, this will be the purchase price plus the cost of\ncapital improvements. It should be noted that no part of the cost of land is\nincluded. Step 2: Compute the\namount, A, by which the depreciable value, V, exceeds the depreciation already\ntaken (or which might have been taken) as a tax deduction (i.e., subtract total\nallowable depreciation to date from V, the result is A.) This number is\nrequired to be reported on the employer’s tax returns. If the employer declines\nto make tax returns available for verification, then A shall be deemed to be\nzero. If A = 0, no further computation is required; the allowance for this part\nis zero. Step 3: Determine the\namount, E, of the employer’s equity in V. This would ordinarily be the sum of the\ndown payment, portions of mortgage payments applied toward principal, and the\ncash contribution toward any capital improvements included in V. Step 4: Compute (E/V)\ntimes (A). Conceptually, this is the portion of the equity which has not been\n“returned” to the employer through depreciation. A “reasonable allowance”,\ni.e., a “return on investment” of up to 5 1/2 percent of this number, may be\nincluded in the employer’s cost. (d)   Cost of\noperation (1)  Annual costs of\noperation incurred in furnishing lodging facilities must be considered in\nmaking “reasonable cost” determinations: these include interest on loans to\npurchase, maintain, or improve the lodging facility, taxes, repairs and\nmaintenance, insurance, and utilities (electricity, water, sewers, garbage collection,\nfuel oil, and so forth.) Repair and maintenance expenses refer to the costs\nwhich are not included under capital improvements. Only the portion of those\ncosts which are directly related to the lodging facility used by the\nemployee(s) may be taken into account in determining the actual cost of\nproviding the lodging. As an example, the cost of property insurance should be\nprorated in proportion to the space of the lodging actually used by the\nemployee(s). (2)  When the\nemployer leases a property from another person, the amount of rent paid by the\nemployer to the other person is considered part of the “reasonable cost”\nprovided that the rent charged provides no profit for the employer, directly or\nindirectly. As an example, if an employer pays a higher rental charge with the\npromise of a rebate from the property owner as an encouragement to lease\ncertain lodging facilities, such higher rent payment may not be used as a\ncomponent of the “reasonable cost” for leasing the lodging facilities. The\nallowable “reasonable cost” amount would be the rent paid by the employer minus\nthe amount of rebate promised and received by the employer from the property\nowner. (3)  When\ndetermining the weekly “reasonable cost” of a lodging facility which may be\nclaimed as a wage credit, the sum of the annual costs (as determined in (1) and\n(2) above) is divided by the number of weeks during which the lodging facility\nis used for occupancy. Where the facility is used for other purposes, in\naddition to lodging, the annual cost is first prorated among the uses. Once the\nweekly “reasonable cost” amount has been determined, it should be divided by\nthe actual number of occupants in the lodging facility where each is provided\nan equal amount of living area. However, if the living areas within the lodging\nfacility are not equal in size, the weekly “reasonable cost” amount should be\ndivided by the square feet of the dwelling. The wage credit which may be\nclaimed per employee in such cases shall be based upon the number of square\nfeet occupied by the employee and /or that individual’s family.","html":"<p>(a)   Meals -\nFood service establishments</p><p>(1)  The “reasonable\ncost” of meals furnished by a food service establishment to its employees\nincludes only the actual cost to the employer of the food, its preparation, and\nrelated supplies.

This position is not applicable where daily washing\nis required and the employer furnishes or reimburses the employee for a single\nuniform. (3)  For enforcement\npurposes, WH will accept the payment to the employee of $3.35 per week or 67\ncents per day as satisfying this requirement. (4)  Since the\nuniform cost would presumably be the same for any day, regardless of the number\nof hours worked, allocating this cost on an hourly basis should be avoided\nexcept as in (d)(2) below. However, if an employer pays on a “cents-per-hour”\nbasis, no monetary violation will exist if the employees receive the full daily\nand/or weekly amounts in each w/w as indicated in (3) above. (5)  Where this\nenforcement position is followed, the time spent in washing uniforms will not\nbe considered hours worked for either MW or OT pay purposes. (6)  Employers or\nemployees are free to establish actual costs, as indicated in (d) below. (c)   Employee\nchooses not to use employer’s free laundry service Where an employer gives notice to employees\nthat the employer will launder or clean all uniforms required to be worn by\nemployees, free of any charge, and all or some employees elect not to avail\nthemselves of such service, the employer will not be required to reimburse the\nemployees for expenses incurred by them for laundering or cleaning their\nuniforms on their own. (d)   Other\nstandards for determination of cost (1)  The enforcement\nposition in (b)(3) above does not prohibit the determination of the cost of\nlaundering or maintaining uniforms from being made on some other basis, so long\nas the actual cost does not cut into required MW or OT compensation. For\nexample, where an employer contracts with a laundry or rental service and in\nturn charges the employees or requires the employees to bear the cost directly,\nthe actual cost may be used if reasonable. (2)  Similarly,\nwhere a specific amount has been negotiated under a bona fide collective\nbargaining agreement (e.g., 5c for each hour worked), this amount may be used,\nif reasonable. (3)  Where the\nemployer does not use the flat daily or weekly basis set forth in subsec (b)(3)\nabove, it is essential that the CO determine and document in the case file the\nactual cost incurred by the employee. (4)  In preparing a\ncase for settlement or for litigation, the enforcement position in subsec\n(b)(3) cannot be relied upon as a basis for action where the employer uses\nanother basis for reimbursing employees for uniform maintenance expenses. (e)   Cost of\npurchasing and repurchasing uniforms (1)  When an\nemployee is required to purchase a uniform, the employee must be reimbursed for\nthe cost of the uniform to the extent that the expense cuts into the MW or OT\ncompensation required by FLSA/PCA/SCA/CWHSSA. (2)  This\nreimbursement must be made promptly on the regular payday for the w/w in which\nthe expense was incurred and may not be spread over the life of the garment. (3)  Further,\nemployers may not avoid such costs by requiring employees to obtain uniforms\nbefore starting the job.

The parties may agree to exclude bona fide meal\nperiods and a regularly scheduled sleeping period of not more than 8 hours,\nprovided the employer furnishes adequate sleeping facilities and the employee\ncan usually enjoy uninterrupted sleep during the period.

Production bonuses and labor saving bonuses present a more\ndifficult problem.

See 29 CFR part 531; FOH30c.  The tip credit equals the difference\nbetween the minimum wage and the direct wage paid, which may be comprised of\ncash, board, lodging, and/or facilities, and must be at least $2.13 per hour. \nFOH30d06(b).  In determining the regular rate for a tipped employee, all\ncomponents of the employee’s wages must be considered (cash, board, lodging,\nfacilities, tip credit). Tips in excess of the FLSA tip credit are not\nconsidered wages under Sec. 3(m) and are not considered in determining the\nregular rate.  29 CFR 531.60. In\ndetermining the regular rate for a tipped employee, both the direct wage and\nthe tip credit must be included.  For example, if the employee is paid a direct\nwage of $2.13 and the employer claims a tip credit of $5.12, the regular rate\nwill be $7.25 and the overtime rate will be $10.88 ($7.25 x 1.5).  The direct\nwage payment in overtime hours would be $5.76 ($10.88 - $5.12); the overtime\ndirect wage payment is not 1.5 x the non-overtime direct wage payment. Examples: (1)  An employee works 50 hours in a tipped occupation. \nThe employer pays a cash wage of $2.13 per hour and claims a tip credit of\n$5.12.  The employer complies with the requirements in 29 CFR 531.59(b) to\ninform its employees about the tip credit and the employee receives at least\n$5.12 per hour in tips. $7.25\nregular rate ($2.13 cash wage + $5.12 tip credit)50 x\n7.25 = 362.50 (straight time)10 x\n.5 x 7.25 = 36.25 (overtime premium)$398.75\ntotal wages due50 x\n5.12 = 256 tip credit398.75\n– 256 = 142.75 direct wage (2)  An employee works 45 hours in a tipped occupation. \nThe employer pays a cash wage of $3.00 per hour and claims a tip credit of\n$4.25.  The employer complies with the requirements in 29 CFR 531.59(b) to\ninform its employees about the tip credit and the employee receives at least\n$4.25 per hour in tips. $7.25\nregular rate ($3.00 cash wage + $4.25 tip credit)45 x\n7.25 = 326.25 (straight time)5 x\n.5 x 7.25 = 18.13 (overtime premium)$\n344.38 total wages due45 x\n4.25 = 191.25 tip credit344.38\n– 191.25 = $153.13 direct or cash wage (e)  \nDeductions  When\nan employer claims a tip credit, the tipped employee is considered to have been\npaid only the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage for all non-overtime hours worked in a\ntipped occupation.  See FOH 30d06.  An employer that claims a tip credit\ntherefore may not make deductions in a workweek of 40 hours or less for\nnon-3(m) costs such as shortages, breakage, cost of uniforms, etc., because any\nsuch deduction would reduce the tipped employee’s wages below the minimum\nwage.  Updating Regulations Issued Under the Fair Labor Standards Act; Final\nRule, 76 FR 18839, April 5, 2011; 29 CFR 531.36.  Because non-3(m) deductions\ncannot be made in a workweek of 40 hours or less when the tip credit is\nclaimed, employers are also prohibited from taking such deductions in overtime\nweeks, even when the regular rate is higher than the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage\n(for example, when a higher state minimum wage is the regular rate).  See 29\nCFR 531.37.  When an employer claims a tip credit, deductions for non-3(m)\nitems, therefore, cannot be valid in an overtime workweek, because deductions\nnot permitted in non-overtime workweeks are also prohibited in overtime\nworkweeks.  See 32j08(b). An\nemployer may only make non-3(m) deductions from the wages of a tipped employee\nwhen no tip credit is claimed and the direct or cash wage paid is greater than\nthe Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.   (f)  \nRegular Rate in Excess of FLSA\nMW When\nFederal, state or local laws require an employer to pay a higher minimum wage\nthan required by FLSA, or if the wage set through established practice,\nagreement, or understanding is greater than the  Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage, FLSA\novertime provisions require that the employee receive the regular rate for all\nhours worked before overtime is calculated.  Where an employer claims a tip\ncredit under Sec. 3(m), straight time wages paid to the employee are capped at\nthe Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.  See FOH30d00. Consequently, where the regular\nrate exceeds the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage, before additional half time for\novertime is computed, the rate paid to the tipped employee in overtime weeks\nmust be raised to the regular rate.  The employer therefore owes the difference\nbetween the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage and the regular rate in cash for all\nhours worked as a tipped employee.   (g)  \nQuestions regarding the proper\ncalculation of overtime pay often arise in situations where state or local laws\nrequire an employer to pay a higher minimum wage than required by the FLSA and\npermit the employer to claim a higher tip credit than permitted under the\nFLSA.   For\nexample, assume the state minimum wage is $7.50 and that the state law requires\na cash wage of $2.13 per hour and allows the employer to take a tip credit of\n$5.37 per hour.  Assuming all hours worked during the week were at the state\nminimum wage rate, the employee’s regular rate is the state minimum wage rate\n($7.50) but the employer is limited to a tip credit of $5.12 under the FLSA\n($7.25 – $2.13). See 29 CFR 778.5.  The employer must make up the difference\nbetween the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage and the regular rate in cash before\ncalculating the additional half time due.  See FOH32j02. (h)  Examples of how to compute overtime for tipped\nemployees For\npurposes of these examples, assume the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage rate is $7.25\nper hour, that the employee worked 45 hours in the workweek, and that all hours\nworked were in a tipped occupation.  Assume the employee meets the Sec. 3(t)\ndefinition of a tipped employee and that the employer complied with the\nrequirements in 29 CFR 531.59(b) to inform employees about the tip credit and\nthat the payroll records are accurate. (1)  The state minimum wage is $7.40 per hour, the employer\npays a cash wage of $2.89 as required under state law and claims a tip credit\nof $4.51.  The employee’s regular rate is $7.40 per hour.   \n\n\n \n  \n  State Tip Credit Provision\n  \n  \n  FLSA Tip Credit Provision\n  \n \n \n  \n  $7.40 (Regular Rate)\n  \n  \n  $7.25 (FLSA MW)\n  \n \n \n  \n  $2.89 (Cash Wage)\n  \n  \n  $2.89 (Cash Wage)\n  \n \n \n  \n  $4.51 (State Tip Credit)\n  \n  \n  $4.36 (FLSA Tip Credit)\n  \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n  \n  Wages Owed:\n  \n  \n  Straight Time\n  \n  \n  45 hours x $7.40 = $333.00\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  OT Premium\n  \n  \n  5 hours x .5 x $7.40 =\n  $18.50\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  Total Wages Due\n  \n  \n  $351.50\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  45 hours x FLSA tip credit\n  of $4.36 = $196.20 \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  $351.50 total wages due -\n  $196.20 FLSA tip credit = $155.30 (direct or cash wage)    \n  \n \n\n\n      (2)  The state minimum wage is $8.15 per hour.  The\nemployer pays a cash wage of $3.95 per hour as required under state law and\nclaims a tip credit of $4.20 per hour.  The employee’s regular rate is $8.15\nper hour.    \n\n\n \n  \n  State Tip Credit Provision\n  \n  \n  FLSA Tip Credit Provision\n  \n \n \n  \n  $8.15 (Regular Rate)\n  \n  \n  $7.25 (FLSA MW)\n  \n \n \n  \n  $3.95 (Cash Wage)\n  \n  \n  $3.95 (Cash Wage)\n  \n \n \n  \n  $4.20 (State Tip Credit)\n  \n  \n  $3.30 (FLSA Tip Credit)\n  \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n  \n  Wages Owed:\n  \n  \n  Straight Time\n  \n  \n  45 hours x $8.15 = $366.75\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  OT Premium\n  \n  \n  5 hours x .5 x $8.15 =\n  $20.38\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  Total Wages Due\n  \n  \n  $387.13\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  45 hours x FLSA tip credit\n  of $3.30 = $148.50 \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  $387.13 total wages due -\n  $148.50 FLSA tip credit = $238.63 (direct or cash wage)    \n  \n \n\n\n (3)  The state minimum wage is $7.50 per hour.  The\nemployer pays a cash wage of $2.13 per hour and claims a tip credit of $5.37\nper hour as permitted under state law.  The employee’s regular rate is $7.50\nper hour.    \n\n\n \n  \n  State Tip Credit Provision\n  \n  \n  FLSA Tip Credit Provision\n  \n \n \n  \n  $7.50 (Regular Rate)\n  \n  \n  $7.25 (FLSA MW)\n  \n \n \n  \n  $2.13 (Cash Wage)\n  \n  \n  $2.13 (Cash Wage)\n  \n \n \n  \n  $5.37 (State Tip Credit)\n  \n  \n  $5.12 (FLSA Tip Credit)\n  \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n  \n  Wages Owed:\n  \n  \n  Straight Time\n  \n  \n  45 hours x $7.50 = $337.50\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  OT Premium\n  \n  \n  5 hours x .5 x $7.50 =\n  $337.50\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  Total Wages Due\n  \n  \n  $356.25\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  45 hours x FLSA tip credit\n  of $5.12 = $230.40 \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  $356.25 total wages due -\n  $230.40 FLSA tip credit = $125.85 (direct or cash wage)    \n  \n \n\n\n (i)   \nDual Occupations  Where\nan employee works in both a tipped occupation and a non-tipped occupation in\nthe same workweek, a weighted average will generally be used to calculate the\nregular rate (blended rate).  29 C.F.R. § 778.115.  Under a blended rate, the\nearnings from the hourly rates for both occupations are added together and the\nsum is divided by the total number of hours worked at both jobs.  The\nemployee’s earnings are the total of all straight time pay plus overtime for\nhours worked in excess of 40 based on one-half times the blended rate. See\n29 CFR 778.419 and FOH 32h00 for guidance on overtime pay based on the rate in\neffect Example: An\nemployee works as a server for 32 hours and as a cook for 22 hours for the same\nemployer in the same workweek.  The employer pays $9.75 per hour for hours\nworked as a cook, which is a non-tipped occupation.  The employer paid a direct\nwage of $2.13 and claimed a tip credit of $5.12 for the hours worked as a\nserver;

or deliver for shipment\nin commerce any goods produced in an establishment in the United States in or\nabout which within thirty days prior to the removal of such goods therefrom any\noppressive child labor has been employed.”  Such “goods” are referred to as\n“hot goods” (see FOH 33a02(c)(1)b for an example of “hot goods”). \n29 CFR 570.104 through 570.111 contain the provisions related to\ncoverage under § 12(a).   (1)  The term goods is defined in § 3(i) of\nthe FLSA as “goods [], wares, products, commodities, merchandise, or articles\nor subjects of commerce of any character, or any part or ingredient thereof . .\n.”  This definition expressly excludes goods after their delivery into the\nactual physical possession of an ultimate consumer other than a producer,\nmanufacturer, or processor.  The term includes such items as foodstuffs,\nclothing, machinery, printed materials, blueprints, and also includes\nintangibles (see 29 CFR 570.107).   (2)  The term commerce is defined in FLSA §\n3(b) as meaning “trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or\ncommunication among the several States or between any State and any place\noutside thereof.”  (3)  The term oppressive child labor is defined in FLSA §\n3(l).  For purposes of § 12(a), oppressive child labor can and does occur in\nestablishments whose minor employees are not covered on an individual or\nenterprise basis under FLSA § 12(c) because the definition of oppressive child\nlabor does not require that the minor employees be covered under the FLSA.   (b)  \nGoods produced in an establishment\nin or about which oppressive CL has been employed are barred as “hot goods” and\nare prohibited from being shipped or delivered for shipment in commerce under §\n12(a) if: (1)  Such goods were removed from the establishment while\nany oppressive CL was still being employed in or about it, or  (2)  Such goods were removed from the establishment within\n30 days after the employment of oppressive CL had ceased in or about the\nestablishment.   (c)  \nThe prohibitions of § 12(a) apply\nonly to the shipment of goods in commerce that were actually “produced” in and\nremoved from an establishment in or about which oppressive CL was employed.   (1)  These hot goods provisions are applicable even though\nthe under-age employee does not himself or herself engage in the production of\nthe goods, as long as somewhere in the establishment in or about which he or\nshe is employed goods are “produced” which are subsequently shipped or\ndelivered for shipment in commerce.  It also does not matter if the youth’s\nemployment that constitutes the oppressive child labor is covered under FLSA §\n12(c). a.    \nFor example, § 12(a) would apply\nwhere 14- or 15- year-old minors are employed to load milk on trucks at a dairy\nestablishment and deliver it to households if the dairy establishment produces\nsome of its goods for shipment in commerce.  This employment constitutes\noppressive child labor because such work is prohibited by § 570.33(k) and (n). b.    \nThe hot goods provisions of §\n12(a) would also apply in the following example.  A 15-year-old minor works as\na cashier in a small retail bakery that makes cakes and pies, some of which are\nshipped, or delivered for shipment, in commerce.  Assume the minor does not\nhandle checks or credit card transactions.  Because the ADV of the enterprise\nis under $500,000, the minor would not be covered on an “enterprise basis”\nunder § 12(c).  Because the minor is not “employed in commerce” or in the\n“production of goods for commerce,” he or she is not covered on an individual\nbasis.  But if this minor’s employment was in violation of the child labor\nstandards—such as working until 10:00 p.m. in violation of the CL Reg 3 hours\nstandards—oppressive child labor would have occurred.  The products produced by\nthe baker during the period of the oppressive CL, and thirty days thereafter,\nwould be “hot goods” under § 12(a).  c.    \nAs explained in section (c)(4),\nbelow, section 12(a) coverage also applies when a minor is employed by an\nemployer other than the establishment owner or operator if that minor performs\nsome work in or about the producing establishment.   (2)  Section 12(a) only applies to “hot goods” and bars a\nproducer, manufacturer, or dealer from shipping or delivering “hot goods” in\ncommerce.  To establish “hot goods” for purposes of § 12(a), WH does not have\nto show that a minor was engaged in the production of goods.  WH must only\ndemonstrate that a minor was illegally employed in or about the establishment\nwhere the goods were produced within 30 days prior to the removal of the goods\nfrom the establishment.  If 30 days pass after the CL violation, and no further\nviolations have occurred, the “hot goods” will have “cooled,” and shipment from\nthe establishment is permitted.  If the goods are removed before 30 days have\npassed, the goods are permanently “hot”.  Finally, § 12(a) does not bar\nshipment or sale of goods where the initial shipment does not occur until the\ngoods have “cooled”. (3)  A producer, manufacturer, or dealer may “ship” goods\nin commerce either by moving them itself in interstate or foreign commerce or\nby causing them to move, such as by delivery to a carrier.   a.    \nA baker “ships” its bread in\ncommerce whether it carries it in its own truck across state lines or sends it\nby contract or common carrier to its customers in other states.  b.    \nA manufacturer delivers its goods\nfor shipment in commerce when it transports its goods in state to a distributor\nwho, as the manufacturer is well aware, will ship the goods into another\nstate.  For example, a paper box manufacturer who ships a carton of boxes to a\nfresh fruit or vegetable packing shed within the same state, with knowledge or\nreason to believe that the boxes will there be filled with fruits or vegetables\nand shipped outside the state, has delivered the boxes for shipment in\ncommerce. c.    \nHowever, the word “ship” must be\napplied in its ordinary meaning.  It does not apply to the transmission of\ntelegraphic messages, for example (see 29 CFR 570.106(a)). (4)  Consideration must be given to both whether a minor is\nemployed “in” or employed “about” the establishment.  a.    \nA minor who performs occupational\nduties on the premises of the producing establishment is employed “in” that\nestablishment.  A minor is also employed “in” an establishment where the minor\nperforms most duties off the premises but is regularly required to perform\ncertain occupational duties in the establishment, such as loading or unloading\na truck.  This is true even though the minor is employed by someone other than\nthe owner or operator of the particular establishment.  b.    \nHowever, a minor is not employed\n“in” an establishment other than his or her employer's merely because such\nestablishment is visited by the minor for brief periods of time and for the\nsole purpose of picking up or delivering a message or other small article. c.    \nIf the minor cannot be considered\nas employed “in” the establishment, he or she may, nevertheless, be employed\n“about” it.  However, the minor must perform occupational duties sufficiently\nclose in proximity to the actual place of production to fall within the\ncommonly understood meaning of the term “about,” and the minor’s occupation\nmust be directly related to the activities carried on in the producing,\nmanufacturing or dealing establishment.   1.    \nFor example, a driver's helper\nemployed to assist in the distribution of the products of a bottling company\nwho regularly boards the delivery truck immediately outside the premises of the\nbottling plant is considered employed “in or about” such establishment, without\nregard to whether he ever enters the plant itself.  2.    \nOn the other hand, employees\nworking entirely within one establishment are not considered to be employed “in\nor about” a wholly different establishment occupying separate premises and\noperated by another employer. This would be true even though the two\nestablishments are contiguous (see 29 CFR 570.110(b)). (5)  Section 12(a) of the FLSA establishes a “good faith”\ndefense from the prohibition on shipping hot goods for a purchaser of these\ngoods who has acquired these goods for value, in good faith, without notice\nthat the goods were produced in violation of the FLSA, and in reliance on\nwritten assurance from the producer that the goods were produced in compliance\nwith the FLSA.   a.    \nFor example a wholesaler who\npurchases goods in “good faith” from a producer, manufacturer, or dealer of\nsuch goods, who in turn sells these goods in his retail establishment, would\nhave a “good faith” defense from the § 12(a) prohibitions.   b.    \nHowever, a person or firm that\nowns the goods throughout the production process, even though some or all of\nthe production work is done by independent contractors, or subcontractors or\nother producers of goods, cannot be a “purchaser in good faith” who is removed\nfrom the “hot goods” provisions of § 12(a).  For example, a garment\nmanufacturer could not claim that it was a “purchaser in good faith”, if it\nowns the product throughout the manufacturing process, even though the cutting,\nsewing, and embroidery work was all performed by independent contractors,\ncontractors, and subcontractors.","html":"<p>(a)  \nSection 12(a) of the FLSA states\nthat “[n]o producer, manufacturer, or dealer shall ship or deliver for shipment\nin commerce any goods produced in an establishment in the United States in or\nabout which within thirty days prior to the removal of such goods therefrom any\noppressive child labor has been employed.”  Such “goods” are referred to as\n“hot goods” (see FOH 33a02(c)(1)b for an example of “hot goods”). \n29 CFR 570.104 through 570.111 contain the provisions related to\ncoverage under § 12(a).  </p><p>(1)  The term goods is defined in § 3(i) of\nthe FLSA as “goods [], wares, products,

goods” for purposes of § 12(a), WH does not have\nto show that a minor was engaged in the production of goods.  WH must only\ndemonstrate that a minor was illegally employed in or about the establishment\nwhere the goods were produced within 30 days prior to the removal of the goods\nfrom the establishment.  If 30 days pass after the CL violation, and no further\nviolations have occurred, the “hot goods” will have “cooled,” and shipment from\nthe establishment is permitted.  If the goods are removed before 30 days have\npassed, the goods are permanently “hot”.  Finally, § 12(a) does not bar\nshipment or sale of goods where the initial shipment does not occur until the\ngoods have “cooled”.</p><p>(3)  A producer, manufacturer, or dealer may “ship” goods\nin commerce either by moving them itself in interstate or foreign commerce or\nby causing them to move, such as by delivery to a carrier.  </p><p>a.    \nA baker “ships” its bread in\ncommerce whether it carries it in its own truck across state lines or sends it\nby contract or common carrier to its customers in other states. </p><p>b.    \nA manufacturer delivers its goods\nfor shipment in commerce when it transports its goods in state to a distributor\nwho, as the manufacturer is well aware, will ship the goods into another\nstate.  For example, a paper box manufacturer who ships a carton of boxes to a\nfresh fruit or vegetable packing shed within the same state, with knowledge or\nreason to believe that the boxes will there be filled with fruits or vegetables\nand shipped outside the state, has delivered the boxes for shipment in\ncommerce.</p><p>c.    \nHowever, the word “ship” must be\napplied in its ordinary meaning.  It does not apply to the transmission of\ntelegraphic messages, for example (see 29 CFR 570.106(a)).</p><p>(4)  Consideration must be given to both whether a minor is\nemployed “in” or employed “about” the establishment. </p><p>a.    \nA minor who performs occupational\nduties on the premises of the producing establishment is employed “in” that\nestablishment.  A minor is also employed “in” an establishment where the minor\nperforms most duties off the premises but is regularly required to perform\ncertain occupational duties in the establishment, such as loading or unloading\na truck.  This is true even though the minor is employed by someone other than\nthe owner or operator of the particular establishment. </p><p>b.    \nHowever, a minor is not employed\n“in” an establishment other than his or her employer's merely because such\nestablishment is visited by the minor for brief periods of time and for the\nsole purpose of picking up or delivering a message or other small article.</p><p>c.    \nIf the minor cannot be considered\nas employed “in” the establishment, he or she may, nevertheless, be employed\n“about” it.  However, the minor must perform occupational duties sufficiently\nclose in proximity to the actual place of production to fall within the\ncommonly understood meaning of the term “about,” and the minor’s occupation\nmust be directly related to the activities carried on in the producing,\nmanufacturing or dealing establishment.  </p><p>1.    \nFor example, a driver's helper\nemployed to assist in the distribution of the products of a bottling company\nwho regularly boards the delivery truck immediately outside the premises of the\nbottling plant is considered employed “in or about” such establishment, without\nregard to whether he ever enters the plant itself. </p><p>2.    \nOn the other hand, employees\nworking entirely within one establishment are not considered to be employed “in\nor about” a wholly different establishment occupying separate premises and\noperated by another employer. This would be true even though the two\nestablishments are contiguous (see 29 CFR 570.110(b)).</p><p>(5)  Section 12(a) of the FLSA establishes a “good faith”\ndefense from the prohibition on shipping hot goods for a purchaser of these\ngoods who has acquired these goods for value, in good faith, without notice\nthat the goods were produced in violation of the FLSA, and in reliance on\nwritten assurance from the producer that the goods were produced in compliance\nwith the FLSA.  </p><p>a.    \nFor example a wholesaler who\npurchases goods in “good faith” from a producer, manufacturer, or dealer of\nsuch goods, who in turn sells these goods in his retail establishment, would\nhave a “good faith” defense from the § 12(a) prohibitions.  </p><p>b.    \nHowever, a person or firm that\nowns the goods throughout the production process, even though some or all of\nthe production work is done by independent contractors, or subcontractors or\nother producers of goods, cannot be a “purchaser in good faith” who is removed\nfrom the “hot goods” provisions of § 12(a).  For example, a garment\nmanufacturer could not claim that it was a “purchaser in good faith”, if it\nowns the product throughout the manufacturing process, even though the cutting,\nsewing, and embroidery work was all performed by independent contractors,\ncontractors, and subcontractors.</p>"},{"section":"33a03","chapter":"33","section_title":"33a03.   Distinction between §§ 12(a) and 12(c) coverage.","text":"(a)  \nCoverage under § 12(c) is\ndependent upon a minor

qualify for such variations, a state\neducational agency (normally the state Department of Education) must file a\nletter of application with the WH Administrator for approval of a program\nplan.  Individual schools or school districts may not apply for or be granted a\nWECEP by WH; approval is granted only to the state government.   a.    \nAfter WH has authorized the state\nprogram, records of the names and addresses of each school enrolling students\nin the WECEP, as well as the number of students enrolled, must be kept at the state\neducational office and made available for review in that office by WH\nrepresentatives.  Additionally, the state educational agency or the local\nschool must keep on file a copy of the written training agreement that is\nrequired for each student participating in the WECEP.  These records must be\nkept for a period of three years.   b.    \nA list of states that have been\nauthorized to operate a WECEP can be found at www.dol.gov/whd. (2)  Hours of work for WECEP students 29\nCFR 570.36(d) provides that students who are working under an approved WECEP\n(including those employed in nonhazardous agricultural occupations) may be\nemployed for as many as 3 hours on any school day and 23 hours in any week\nschool is in session, any portion of which may be during school hours.  No\nother changes, however, in the hours standards established by CL Reg 3 are\npermitted and the standards will not be waived.  (3)  Occupations for WECEP students a.    \n29 CFR 570.36(c) prohibits WECEP\nparticipants from being employed in the occupations of mining, manufacturing,\nand those the Secretary of Labor has declared to be hazardous for the\nemployment of minors between the ages of 16 and 18 (the HOs).  This same\nsection provides for the employment of WECEP students in some occupations\notherwise prohibited under CL Reg 3 if a “variance” has been issued by the WH\nAdministrator. b.    \nVariances.  Before a student may\nbe employed in a prohibited occupation, the state educational agency must\nsubmit a written request for a variance to the WH Administrator which outlines\nall the steps the WECEP will take to ensure that the minor can safely perform\nthe work in question.  Information regarding the classroom and on-the-job\nsafety training, supervision, and personal protective equipment the youth will\nreceive must be detailed in the request.  1.    \nWECEP variance approvals are\nspecific to the school operating the WECEP and the employer that employs the\nstudent.  Variance approvals run concurrently with the WECEP approval period of\nthe state program (up to two years).  Variances are valid only during the\nmonths school is in session for the WECEP participant.  The variances are not\nvalid during summer vacation periods.   2.    \nThe most common occupations\ncovered by WECEP variance requests that have been approved by the NO on an\nindividual basis, include:  A.   \nCooking over electric and gas\ngrills that does not involve cooking with an open flame and cooking with deep\nfat fryers.  Prior to February 14, 2005 when new CL Reg 3 cooking rules became\neffective, these requests allowed WECEP participants to perform cooking duties\nthat were not “in plain view” of the customer.  After February 14, 2005, WH\nwill consider issuing, on a case by case basis, variances that allow WECEP\nstudents to operate deep fat fryers that are not equipped with devices that\nautomatically raise and lower the baskets. B.   \nUnloading trucks at retail and\nfood service establishments.  The variance approvals issued by the National\nOffice impose limitations on the amount of weight that may be lifted and the\namount of time that may be spent performing this task. C.   \nOperating power-driven lawn mowers\n(not riding mowers) and weed-eaters that use plastic “string” (not metal) to\ncut vegetation.  Limitations on the amount of time WECEP participants may\nperform these duties are detailed on the variance approvals. D.   \nWashing and cleaning of school\nbuses.  The variance approvals allow WECEP participants to work in garages and\n“bus barns” but not to use power washing equipment, step ladders or ladders,\nnor to work in “pits” when washing or cleaning buses. (4)  Wage rates for WECEP students WECEP\nstudents generally must be paid the applicable MW rate (including a Youth\nMinimum Wage where applicable).  Student-learner certificates cannot apply to\nthe employment of WECEP participants because, by definition, student-learners\nmust be at least 16 years of age (see 29 CFR 520.300).  Under certain\nconditions, properly certified employers may pay WECEP participants less than\nthe applicable federal minimum wage as full-time students in accordance with\nFLSA § 14(b) (see 29 CFR part 519). (d)  \nWork-Study Program (WSP) (1)  29 CFR 570.37 provides for certain variations from CL\nReg 3 for minors 14 and 15 years of age who are enrolled in and employed\npursuant to a Work-Study Program (WSP) that has been approved by WH.  In order\nto qualify for such variations, the superintendent of the school attended by\nthe WSP candidate must first file with the WH Administrator a letter of\napplication for approval of the WSP. (2)  The WSP is open only to youth enrolled in a college\npreparatory curriculum.  A WSP student-participant must receive, every school\nyear he or she participates in the WSP, at least the minimum number of hours of\nclassroom instruction required to complete a fully-accredited college preparatory\ncurriculum (as determined by the State Educational Agency responsible for\nestablishing such standards).  Such classroom instruction shall include, every\nyear the youth participates in the WSP, training in workplace safety and state\nand federal child labor provisions and rules. (3)  Hours of work for WSP participants a.    \nEmployment of student-participants\nin the WSP authorized by § 570.37 will be confined to not more than 18 hours in\na week when school is in session, a portion of which may be during school hours\nin accordance with the following formula that is based upon a continuous\nfour-week-cycle. 1.    \nIn three of the four weeks, the\nparticipant is permitted to work during school hours on only one day per week,\nand for no more than for eight hours on that day. 2.    \nDuring the remaining week of the\nfour-week cycle, the WSP student-participant is permitted to work during school\nhours on no more than two days, and for no more than for eight hours on each of\nthose two days. b.    \nThe employment of WSP\nstudent-participants must also comport with the time of day and number of hours\nstandards contained in §§ 570.35(a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(6). c.    \nThe limitations on the number of\nhours that participating students may be employed, as described in FOH\n33b02(d)(3) above, constitute the absolute maximum number of hours that\nparticipants may be employed.   1.    \nParticipating schools and\nemployers may choose to adopt some other schedule of work hours that comports\nwith the established maxima—such as one four-hour day or one six-hour day each\nworkweek; or two eight-hour days each weekend; or three hours a day at the end\nof each of three school days, as long as those hours comply with end-of-day\nhours standards established by § 570.35(a)(6).  2.    \nThey are, however, prohibited from\nallowing the same participant to work during school hours on more than one\nschool day in any school week—except every fourth week in the four-week cycle\nwhen such youth may work during school hours on no more than two school days in\nthat week. (4)  Occupations for WSP students   a.    \nWSP participants must be employed\nin accordance with the provisions of §§ 570.33 and .34. b.    \nThe WSP has no provisions for\nspecial occupational variances like those found in WECEP. (5)  Wage rates for WSP students   a.    \nWSP students generally must be\npaid the applicable MW rate (including a Youth Minimum Wage where applicable). \nStudent-learner certificates cannot apply to the employment of WSP participants\nbecause, by definition, student-learners must be at least 16 years of age (see\n29 CFR 520.300).  Under certain conditions, properly certified employers may\npay WSP participants less than the applicable federal MW as full-time students\nin accordance with FLSA § 14(b) (see 29 CFR part 519).  b.    \nSome WSP students may wish to\nassign their wages to their school to defray the cost of the students'\neducations.  WH will not take exception to such assignments as long as they\ncomport with the provisions of 29 CFR 531.40. (e)  \nYouth employed by a parent in a\nbusiness

the WECEP approval period of\nthe state program (up to two years).  Variances are valid only during the\nmonths school is in session for the WECEP participant.  The variances are not\nvalid during summer vacation periods.  </p><p>2.    \nThe most common occupations\ncovered by WECEP variance requests that have been approved by the NO on an\nindividual basis, include: </p><p>A.   \nCooking over electric and gas\ngrills that does not involve cooking with an open flame and cooking with deep\nfat fryers.  Prior to February 14, 2005 when new CL Reg 3 cooking rules became\neffective, these requests allowed WECEP participants to perform cooking duties\nthat were not “in plain view” of the customer.  After February 14, 2005, WH\nwill consider issuing, on a case by case basis, variances that allow WECEP\nstudents to operate deep fat fryers that are not equipped with devices that\nautomatically raise and lower the baskets.</p><p>B.   \nUnloading trucks at retail and\nfood service establishments.  The variance approvals issued by the National\nOffice impose limitations on the amount of weight that may be lifted and the\namount of time that may be spent performing this task.</p><p>C.   \nOperating power-driven lawn mowers\n(not riding mowers) and weed-eaters that use plastic “string” (not metal) to\ncut vegetation.  Limitations on the amount of time WECEP participants may\nperform these duties are detailed on the variance approvals.</p><p>D.   \nWashing and cleaning of school\nbuses.  The variance approvals allow WECEP participants to work in garages and\n“bus barns” but not to use power washing equipment, step ladders or ladders,\nnor to work in “pits” when washing or cleaning buses.</p><p>(4)  Wage rates for WECEP students</p><p>WECEP\nstudents

Manufacturing, mining, and processing.","text":"(a)  \n29 CFR 570.33(a) prohibits the\nemployment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing, mining, or processing\noccupations.  This section also prohibits the employment of such minors in\noccupations which require the minors to perform any duties in work rooms or\nwork places where goods are manufactured, mined, or otherwise processed.  FLSA\n§ 13(c)(7) provides an exemption from these requirements for certain youth who\nmay now be employed inside and outside of establishments where power-driven\nmachinery is used to process wood products (see FOH 33e06). (b)  \nThe definitions of manufacturing\nand processing contained in (e) and (f) below are intended for use only in\nconnection with the CL provisions of the FLSA. (c)  \nIt is necessary to distinguish\nbetween manufacturing and processing only when the parental exemption is\ninvolved (see FOH 33c00).  The parental exemption contained in the\nFLSA does not permit the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing or\nmining, but does allow the employment of this age group by a parent in\nprocessing occupations. (d)  \nAlthough CL Reg 3 generally\nprohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in processing occupations (29\nCFR 570.33(a)), youth may perform certain named processing occupations that are\ndetailed in § 570.34.   (e)  \nManufacturing defined The\nterm manufacturing means making anything from raw materials by\nhand, or by machinery, or by art.  The process of manufacturing generally\ninvolves the transformation of raw materials or semi-finished goods into new or\ndifferent articles.  The manufacturing process is not completed until the\narticle being manufactured has reached the form in which it will be available\nto the ultimate consumer.  Any occupation involved in the manufacture of a\nproduct from the assembling of the raw materials for manufacture to the\ncompletion of the manufactured article is a part of the manufacturing process,\nand, therefore, a manufacturing occupation.  All manufacturing is processing,\nbut not all processing is manufacturing.  The following are examples of\nmanufacturing within the meaning of CL Reg 3:   (1)  Trimming and examining of items when performed as a\npart of a manufacturing process. (2)  Quality control and inspection of manufactured\nproducts.   (3)  Cleaning of a printing press and proofreading in a\nprint shop.   (4)  Canning of fresh fruits or vegetables.   (5)  The assembly of component parts into a finished\nproduct away from the place where the component parts are manufactured is a\ncontinuation of the manufacturing process, and is manufacturing.   (6)  Assembling of box shook or crates in which goods are\nto be packed, including making of the lid or cover, is a change in the raw\nmaterial from which the box or crate is made and constitutes “manufacturing”\nwhether done by hand or machine.  However, assembling light-weight flat-folded\ncartons either by stapling with a hand stapler machine or by pasting with tape\nis not manufacturing.   (7)  “Lidding”—the operation of fastening down the cover on\nthe filled container—is manufacturing when it is accomplished by use of a\npower-driven machine.   (8)  Stitching of bags containing produce by means of\nautomatic electric sewing machines in fresh fruit and vegetable packing sheds\nis manufacturing.   (9)  The folding, pinning, and packaging for shipment of\nnewly manufactured apparel. (10)  “Carding.”  If the article is sold to the consumer as a\npackaged or carded article, as is often the case with jewelry or buttons, the\npackaging or carding of the article into the form in which it is offered to the\npublic is considered an integral part of the manufacturing of the article when\nthe work is performed in the manufacturing establishment. (f)  \nProcessing defined (1)  The term processing ordinarily is understood to convey\nthe idea of an operation in the course of which goods undergo a change in form\nor substance.  Examples of processing within the meaning of CL Reg 3 are:   a.    \nCleaning and filleting of fish,\nfreezing fresh shrimp, and the picking and packing of crabs. b.    \nSlaughtering of livestock.   c.    \nDressing of poultry.   d.    \nCracking of nuts.  e.    \nLaundering, folding, hanging, and\npressing clean laundry; and the altering of clothes (whether performed in\ncommercial laundries or retail dry cleaners).  Except the washing and drying of\nlaundry performed in a coin-operated laundromat with home-type washer and dryer\nmachines is not considered processing if performed in a room separated from all\nother processing.  f.     \nCutting or chipping of ice.   g.    \nAir drying or seasoning of\nlumber.   h.    \nRepairing of motor vehicles,\nchanging tires and batteries.   i.     \nPlacing of business records on\nmicrofilm.   j.     \nOperations in connection with bulk\nmailings including folding letters; addressing, stuffing, and sealing\nenvelopes; affixing postage; and bundling mailings.   k.    \nPainting of mine timbers; painting\nand embossing objects.   l.   \nDeveloping of X-rays. m.  \nDevelopment of film into\nphotographs, including the use of automated systems in retail stores. n.    \nThe cutting of “mats” for\nphotographs, engravings, and artwork whether by hand, with a power-driven tool,\nor a computerized automatic cutter.   (2)  The following activities would not be manufacturing or\nprocessing activities: a.    \nThe trimming and shearing of\nordinary household-size Christmas trees with hand tools (i.e., not power-driven\nequipment) does not constitute a “processing occupation” as the term is used in\nCL Reg 3.  Therefore, minors 14 and 15 years of age may be employed in this\noccupation in accordance with the other provisions of CL Reg 3.  In some\ninstances, occupations in connection with Christmas trees may be within the\ndefinition of agriculture contained in FLSA § 3(f) (see\nFOH 20b06); in such cases §§ 13(c)(1) and (2) apply.  b.    \nThe transfer of propane from large\npressurized tanks to smaller tanks of a lower pressure without the use of power\ndriven equipment is not considered processing.  Therefore, minors 14 and 15 years\nof age are not be prohibited from performing this activity because it is not\nconsidered processing.  The basic form of the propane gas is not altered when\nit is transferred from the large pressurized tank to the smaller pressurized\ntank.   c.    \nThe packing of fresh fruits and\nvegetables is not processing because the goods remain in their raw or natural\nstate.  Packing includes cleaning, washing, trimming, application of artificial\ncoloring, sorting, grading, tiering, wrapping, packaging and labeling packages\nwhen these operations take place in conjunction with and as a part of the\npacking of fresh fruits and vegetables.  d.    \nThe tagging and pricing of\nclothing for sale in a retail used-clothing shop, when some of the clothing is\nnot salable and is returned to a central location for processing into rags or\nsold for scrap, is not processing.  The mere sorting of clothing does not\nchange or alter the clothing.   e.    \nThe stuffing of newspapers—that is\nthe placing of one section of newspaper inside another—when performed outside\nthe work rooms in which printing, manufacturing, or processing takes place, is\na distribution function rather than a manufacturing or processing function. \nTherefore, 14- and 15-year-old minors may be employed in such newspaper\nstuffing, provided all the terms and conditions of CL Reg 3 are met.  This\napplies also to other occupations in the newspaper industry further removed\nfrom the manufacturing of the newspaper, such as bundling, tying up,\naddressing, and other mailing room occupations, and to employment in a\nwholesale house engaged in the distribution of newspapers and magazines. \nProhibited processing would occur if the minors placed newspapers in plastic\nbags and then “heat sealed” the bags for security reasons or to protect the\ncontents from the elements.","html":"<p>(a)  \n29 CFR

manufacturing and processing only when the parental exemption is\ninvolved (see FOH 33c00).  The parental exemption contained in the\nFLSA does not permit the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing or\nmining, but does allow the employment of this age group by a parent in\nprocessing occupations.</p><p>(d)  \nAlthough CL Reg 3 generally\nprohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in processing occupations (29\nCFR 570.33(a)), youth may perform certain named processing occupations that are\ndetailed in § 570.34.  </p><p>(e)  \n<b>Manufacturing defined</b></p><p>The\nterm manufacturing means making anything from raw materials by\nhand, or by machinery, or by art.  The process of manufacturing generally\ninvolves the transformation of raw materials or semi-finished goods into new or\ndifferent articles.  The manufacturing process is not completed until the\narticle being manufactured has reached the form in which it will be available\nto the ultimate consumer.  Any occupation involved in the manufacture of a\nproduct from the assembling of the raw materials for manufacture to the\ncompletion of the manufactured article is a part of the manufacturing process,\nand, therefore, a manufacturing occupation.  All manufacturing is processing,\nbut not all processing is manufacturing.  The following are examples of\nmanufacturing within the meaning of CL Reg 3:  </p><p>(1)  Trimming and examining of items when performed as a\npart of a manufacturing process.</p><p>(2)  Quality control and inspection of manufactured\nproducts.  </p><p>(3)  Cleaning of a printing press and proofreading in a\nprint shop.  </p><p>(4)  Canning of fresh fruits or vegetables.  </p><p>(5)  The assembly of component parts into a finished\nproduct away from the place where the component parts are manufactured is a\ncontinuation of the manufacturing process, and is manufacturing.  </p><p>(6)  Assembling of box shook or crates in which goods are\nto be packed, including making of the lid or cover, is a change in the raw\nmaterial from which the box or crate is made and constitutes “manufacturing”\nwhether done by hand or machine.  However, assembling light-weight flat-folded\ncartons either by stapling with a hand stapler machine or by pasting with tape\nis not manufacturing.  </p><p>(7)  “Lidding”—the operation of fastening down the cover on\nthe filled container—is manufacturing when it is accomplished by use of a\npower-driven machine.  </p><p>(8)  Stitching of bags containing produce by means of\nautomatic electric sewing machines in fresh fruit and vegetable packing sheds\nis manufacturing.  </p><p>(9)  The folding, pinning, and packaging for shipment of\nnewly manufactured apparel.</p><p>(10)  “Carding.”  If the article is sold to the consumer as a\npackaged or carded article, as is often the case with jewelry or buttons, the\npackaging or carding of the article into the form in which it is offered to the\npublic is considered an integral part of the manufacturing of the article when\nthe work is performed in the manufacturing establishment.</p><p>(f)  \n<b>Processing defined</b></p><p>(1)  The term processing ordinarily is understood to convey\nthe idea of an operation in the course of which goods undergo a change in form\nor substance.  Examples of processing within the meaning of CL Reg 3 are:  </p><p>a.    \nCleaning and filleting of fish,\nfreezing fresh shrimp, and the picking and packing of crabs.</p><p>b.    \nSlaughtering of livestock.  </p><p>c.    \nDressing of poultry.  </p><p>d.    \nCracking of nuts. </p><p>e.    \nLaundering, folding, hanging, and\npressing clean laundry; and the altering of clothes (whether performed in\ncommercial laundries or retail dry cleaners).  Except the washing and drying of\nlaundry performed in a coin-operated laundromat with home-type washer and dryer\nmachines is not considered processing if performed in a room separated from all\nother processing. </p><p>f.     \nCutting or chipping of ice.  </p><p>g.    \nAir drying or seasoning of\nlumber.  </p><p>h.    \nRepairing of motor vehicles,\nchanging tires and batteries.  </p><p>i.     \nPlacing of business records on\nmicrofilm.  </p><p>j.     \nOperations in connection with bulk\nmailings including folding letters; addressing, stuffing, and sealing\nenvelopes; affixing postage; and bundling mailings.  </p><p>k.    \nPainting of mine timbers; painting\nand embossing objects.  </p><p>l.   \nDeveloping of X-rays.</p><p>m.  \nDevelopment of film into\nphotographs, including the use of automated systems in retail stores.</p><p>n.    \nThe cutting of “mats” for\nphotographs, engravings, and artwork whether by hand, with a power-driven tool,\nor a computerized automatic cutter.  </p><p>(2)  The following activities would not be manufacturing or\nprocessing activities:</p><p>a.    \nThe trimming and shearing of\nordinary household-size Christmas trees with hand tools (i.e., not power-driven\nequipment) does not constitute a “processing occupation” as the term is used in\nCL Reg 3.  Therefore, minors 14 and 15 years of age may be employed in this\noccupation in accordance with the other provisions of CL Reg 3.  In some\ninstances, occupations in connection with Christmas trees may be within the\ndefinition of agriculture contained in FLSA § 3(f) (see\nFOH 20b06); in such cases §§ 13(c)(1) and (2) apply. </p><p>b.    \nThe transfer of propane from large\npressurized tanks to smaller tanks of a lower pressure without the use of power\ndriven equipment is not considered processing.  Therefore, minors 14 and 15 years\nof age are not be prohibited from performing this activity because it is not\nconsidered processing.  The basic form of the propane gas is not altered when\nit is transferred from the large pressurized tank to the smaller pressurized\ntank.  </p><p>c.    \nThe packing of fresh fruits and\nvegetables is not processing because the goods remain in their raw or natural\nstate.  Packing includes cleaning, washing, trimming, application of artificial\ncoloring, sorting, grading, tiering, wrapping, packaging and labeling packages\nwhen these operations take place in conjunction with and as a part of the\npacking of fresh fruits and vegetables. </p><p>d.    \nThe tagging and pricing of\nclothing for sale in a retail used-clothing shop, when some of the clothing is\nnot salable and is returned to a central location for processing into rags or\nsold for scrap, is not processing.  The mere sorting of clothing does not\nchange or alter the clothing.  </p><p>e.    \nThe stuffing of newspapers—that is\nthe placing of one section of newspaper inside another—when performed outside\nthe work rooms in which printing, manufacturing, or processing takes place, is\na distribution function rather than a manufacturing or processing function. \nTherefore, 14- and 15-year-old minors may be employed in such newspaper\nstuffing, provided all the terms and conditions of CL Reg 3 are met.  This\napplies also to other occupations in the newspaper industry further removed\nfrom the manufacturing of the newspaper, such as bundling, tying up,\naddressing, and other mailing room occupations, and to employment in a\nwholesale house engaged in the distribution of newspapers and magazines. \nProhibited processing would occur if the minors placed newspapers in plastic\nbags and then “heat sealed” the bags for security reasons or to protect the\ncontents from the elements.</p>"},{"section":"33c02","chapter":"33","section_title":"33c02.

the\nmachine, ensuring that the load the machine is carrying or transporting is\nproperly balanced or distributed, providing direction for the placement of a\nload (as in the case of a forklift), and providing physical or verbal\nassistance in the steering of machinery—would all be performing tending activities\nunder CL Reg 3.   (5)  Tending includes assisting passengers on and off such\npower-driven machinery as a ski lift, an amusement park ride, or a slide at a\nwater park (when water is pumped to the top of the slide).   (e)  \nThe following are WH enforcement\npositions relating to the operation and/or tending of certain pieces of\npower-machinery.  A discussion regarding power-driven kitchen equipment and\nfood processing equipment is contained in FOH 33c12. (1) \nVacuum\ncleaners and floor waxers.  In addition to certain office machines (see\nFOH 33d01) and kitchen equipment (see FOH 33c12), CL Reg\n3 permits 14- and 15-year-olds to operate vacuum cleaners and floor waxers (see\n29 CFR 570.34(h)).   a.    \nThe term floor waxers refers to\nthose combination or multipurpose floor care machines designed to strip wax\nfrom floors, reapply wax, and buff or polish floors.  Such machines, also\ncalled buffers, burnishers, and polishers, consist of a motor housed above a\ncircular rotating horizontal surface to which various pads or brushes may be\nattached, depending upon the task to be performed.  The operator directs the\nmovement of the machine using a handle that rises perpendicular to the base of\nthe machine. b.    \nThe term floor waxers does not\ninclude the above described machines when used to sand or refinish floors, as\nsuch equipment would generally be prohibited under HO 5 (Occupations involved\nin the operation of power-driven wood-working machines).  In addition, CL Reg 3\nprohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in processing and construction\noccupations. c.    \nThe term floor waxers does not\ninclude any floor stripper, cleaner, scrubber, burnisher or polisher upon which\nthe operator may ride while operating the machine. (2)  Power-driven mowers.  29 CFR 570.33(e) prohibits the\nemployment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations involving the operating or\ntending of power-driven machinery, and specifically names lawn mowers. \nFurthermore, Hazardous Occupations Order 2 (HO 2) would prohibit anyone under\nthe age of 18 from operating a riding lawn mower when used as a means of\ntransportation on public roads or highways (see FOH 33h02(e)(3)). (3) \nCutters,\nincluding weed trimmers and “weed eaters”.  The prohibitions of 29 CFR\n570.33(e) include operating or tending power-driven “cutters” such as weed\ntrimmers, “weed eaters,” and hedge trimmers. (4)  Golf carts and all terrain vehicles (ATVs).  29 CFR\n570.33(e) prohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from operating or tending\npower-driven machinery, including golf carts and ATVs. \n29 CFR 570.33(f) prohibits these same minors from being employed in\noccupations involving the operation of motor vehicles.  As golf carts and ATV’s\nare power-driven machines that are also motor vehicles, no one under 16 years\nof age may operate or tend such machines. a.    \nThese CL Reg 3 prohibitions are\nmuch broader than those of HO 2.  The CL Reg 3 prohibitions are not restricted\nto the operation of the motor vehicle on “public roads or highways.”   b.    \nThe operation of a golf cart or an\nATV would also be prohibited under HO 2 if the minor were operating the vehicle\nas a means of transportation on a public road or highway (see FOH\n33e02c(2)(b)). (5) \n“Cart\nCaddy” and “QuicKART”.  29 CFR 507.33(e) prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from\noperating or tending power-driven machinery.  This would include the “Cart\nCaddy,” “QuicKART,” and similar pieces of equipment. a.    \nThe “Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART”\nare two types of power-driven machines often used by grocers and other retail\nstores to move large strings of shopping carts.  These machines are hooked to\nthe last shopping cart in a string and then the operator guides the string of\ncarts back to the store while commanding the machine to move by means of a\nhand-held remote control.  The operator walks behind the machine and operates\nthe manual throttle when returning to the parking lot to collect more carts.   b.    \nAs these machines are not\nconsidered to be “motor vehicles” as defined in HO 2, they do not fall within\nthe scope of HO 2.  Sixteen- and 17-year-old minors are permitted to operate\nthese machines (see FOH 33h02(e)(2)). (6) \nOffice\nmachines.  29 CFR 570.33(e) and 570.34(a) permit 14- and 15-year-old minors to\noperate office machines.  Office machines that may be operated by 14- and\n15-year-old minors include computers, typewriters, electric staplers, printers,\ncopiers, cash registers, pencil sharpeners, automatic letter openers, adding\nmachines and calculators, postage machines, automatic filing systems, VCRs, and\ndigital cameras.   (7)  Paper shredders.  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may\noperate “office type” paper shredders in an office setting as part of “office\nwork.”  CL Reg 3 prohibits such youth from operating paper shredders in an\nindustrial or recycling setting.  (8) \nAmusement\npark and water park rides.  The CL Reg 3 general prohibition against the\noperation and tending of power-driven machinery includes the operating or\ntending of all power-driven amusement park and water amusement park rides.   a.    \nTending\nwould include such duties as assisting riders as they enter and leave the ride,\nchecking to ensure seat belts are properly fastened, and policing the area to\nensure the ride is operated safely. b.    \nThese\nprohibitions extend to most power-driven rides and attractions at water parks\nas well.  29 CFR 570.34(l)(1) specifically prohibits all minors under 16 years\nof age from working as dispatchers at the top of elevated water slides (see\nFOH 33d06(d)(2)).  Note that certain activities may be performed by\nproperly certified 15 year old lifeguards at traditional swimming pools and\nwater amusement parks (including such water park facilities as wave pools, lazy\nrivers, specialized activity areas that may include water falls and sprinkler\nareas, and at the receiving or splashdown areas of the elevated water slides\n(see 29 CFR 570.34(l)(1); see also  FOH  33d06). WHD\nFLSA Non-Administrator Letter January 17, 2006 c.    \nIn addition, 29 CFR 570.33(f)\nprohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from operating a motor vehicle or serving\nas helpers on such vehicles.  Some amusement park rides or equipment, such as\ngo-carts, coaches, and equipment used in daily parades, meet the definition of\nmotor vehicles (for purposes of Reg. 3, WHD uses the definition of motor\nvehicle from HO 2, 29 CFR 570.52(c)(1)).   d.    \n29 CFR 570.33(n)(1) prohibits 14-\nand 15-year-olds from performing occupations in connection with the\ntransportation of persons or property by rail, highway, air, water, pipeline or\nother means.  Some amusement park rides, such as boats, paddle boats, “swan\nrides,” ferries, and railroads, fall within this prohibition. e.    \nThe operation of amusement park\nrides is not prohibited for 16- and 17-year-old minors under Hazardous\nOccupations Order 7 (HO 7).  Although a number of rides in amusement and theme\nparks have characteristics similar to certain machines that minors are\nprohibited from operating under HO 7, they are not derricks,\ncranes, hoists, elevators, or manlifts\nas defined by the HO (see FOH 33h07(c)). (9) \nConveyors.  See FOH\n33c17. (10) \nAutomatic\nelevators.  CL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from operating “automatic”\nfreight elevators and automatic combined passenger/freight elevators.  Such\nyouth may operate and ride in fully automatic passenger elevators as found in\nmost office buildings.  See FOH 33h07.","html":"<p>(a)  \n29 CFR 570.33(e) generally\nprohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from occupations which involve the operating,\ntending,

prohibitions of HO 2 (see\n29 CFR 570.52).   (2)  In addition to the examples listed in 29 CFR\n570.52(c)(1), WH has made the following determinations regarding the definition\nof a motor vehicle under 29 CFR part 570:  a.    \nPower-driven golf carts and all\nterrain vehicles (ATVs) are motor vehicles (see 75 FR 28408, see\nalso FOH 33h02(3)).  The “Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART,” two types of

 (c)  \nThe term motor vehicle helper is\nnot defined in CL Reg 3.  Reg 3 prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from “service as\nhelpers on such vehicles”.  This provision has been included in CL Reg 3,\nwithout change, since the inception of the regulations as a temporary rule in\n1938.  WH’s interpretation of the term motor vehicle helper has evolved over\nthe years and was influenced by the definition of outside helper contained in\nHO 2 (see 29 CFR 570.52(c)). (1)  For purposes of CL Reg 3, WH considers a helper on a\nmotor vehicle to be one whose employment assists in the operation of a motor\nvehicle used in the transportation or delivery of persons or property.  Duties\nmay include assisting in the pick-up and/or delivery of people or property, the\nloading or unloading of the vehicle, shifting property around the vehicle,\nassisting the driver of the vehicle or other helpers on motor vehicles.   (2)  A helper on a motor vehicle does not have to\nultimately ride as a passenger, either inside or outside of the vehicle, to be\nconsidered a helper under CL Reg 3.  But the mere fact that a minor rides as a\npassenger on a vehicle during working hours does not make that minor a “helper”\nunder CL Reg 3. a.    \nSection 570.34(k) permits 14- and\n15-year-olds to load onto and unload from motor vehicles the light, personal,\nnon-powered hand tools, personal protective equipment, and other personal items\nthat they will use as part of their employment under certain conditions (see\nFOH 33d05). b.    \nYouth peddling and door-to-door\nsalespersons as motor vehicle helpers 1.    \nSection 570.33(j) prohibits the\nemployment of minors under 16 years of age in youth peddling or as door-to-door\nsalespersons—selling such things as candy, greeting cards, calendars, etc. \nYouth peddlers often perform motor vehicle helper duties prohibited by CL Reg 3\n(see FOH 33c07(c)(2)b.). 2.    \nMinors who are illegally employed\nas youth peddlers often do more than simply ride in the crew leader’s van or\nautomobile while being transported to the sales areas—they often facilitate the\nsales operations by performing such activities as sorting merchandise and\npacking peddler’s kits while in transit, or loading and unloading the\nmerchandise being sold.  When performing these tasks, the youth peddlers are\nalso engaged as helpers on a motor vehicle under CL Reg 3. 3.    \nMinors who merely ride in the crew\nleader’s vehicle and perform no activities that facilitate the movement of the\npersons or property being transported would not be considered to be helpers on\na motor vehicle under CL Reg 3. (d)  Riding as a passenger on motor vehicles (1)  29 CFR 570.34(o) permits 14- and 15-year-olds to ride\ninside passenger compartments of

15-year-olds are\nprohibited from operating many other pieces of power-driven equipment used in\nkitchens and food service establishments.  Below are specific pieces of\npower-driven kitchen equipment that are cited in the regulations or upon which\nWH has formally opined. (1)  Toasters.  29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and\n15-year-old minors to operate certain machines, including toasters.   a.    \nWH has long interpreted the term\ntoaster to mean that type of equipment that was generally found in snack bars\nand lunch counters when CL Reg 3 was issued and used to toast such items as\nslices of bread and English muffins.  This includes such equipment as the two-\nor four-slice “pop-up” toasters similar to those manufactured for home use and\nthe small conveyor-type bread toasters now often found at self-service\nbreakfast buffets (see 75 FR 28409).   b.    \nBroilers, automatic broiler\nsystems, high speed ovens, and rapid toaster machines used at quick service\nrestaurants to toast such items as buns, bagels, and muffins—all of which\noperate at high temperatures, often in excess of 500 degrees Fahrenheit—are not\ntoasters under CL Reg 3 and minors must be at least 16 years of age to operate\nthem (see 75 FR 28409).  One rapid toaster that 14- and 15-year-olds are not\npermitted to operate is the Model VCT-200.  (2)  Broilers, including Automatic Broiler Systems   a.    \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds are\nprohibited from performing all baking activities, including operating most\novens, and from cooking with all broilers.  Some electric and gas grills that\nhave solid cooking surfaces on top, are also equipped with a broiler under the\ngrill that takes advantage of the single source of heat (electric element or\ngas flame).  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may cook with such grills, but may not\nuse the broilers. b.    \nAutomatic Broiler Systems (see\n29 CFR 570.34(c)).  Fourteen and fifteen year olds are prohibited from\noperating automatic broilers and cooking systems, such as those produced by the\nNeico Automatic Broilers.  NEICO broilers – also called Flexi-Chef® Cooking\nSystems – and other automatic broiler systems use a combination of convection\nand radiant heat to flame broil a wide variety of items.  These items include\nribs, chicken, steak, hamburgers, seafood, nachos, vegetables and breadsticks. \nAutomatic broilers, which can be powered by electric, natural gas, or propane,\noften operate at temperatures in excess of 500 °F.   1.    \nAutomatic broilers may operate\nusing a conveyor or system of conveyors.  The product is simply placed on the\nconveyor at the feed-end and it flows through to the discharge-end, flame\nbroiled on both sides at the same time.   2.    \nOn some systems, called\nreturn-flow broilers, the product is both fed and returned on the same end of\nthe broiler.  Some automatic broilers also feature up to four independently\ntimed conveyor belts, allowing the user to broil up to four separate items at\nthe same time.  The broilers may also have a “meat holding unit” for limited\nproduct holding after broiling and a “bun-grill” for toasting buns.   3.    \nEnforcement experience indicates\nthat these automatic broilers are used in a variety of food service\nestablishments.  (3)  Rotisseries (see 29 CFR 570.34(c)).  A\nrotisserie is a device that cooks food while it slowly rotates.  Heating\nsources may be electricity, gas, charcoal, or wood.  A rotisserie contains a\nspit fitted with a pair of prongs that slide along its length. Food (usually\nmeat) is impaled on the spit and the prongs (which are inserted on each side of\nthe food) are screwed tightly into place to hold the food securely. Modern\nrotisseries have a motor that automatically turns the shaft, while their\npredecessors relied on human power.   a.    \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds are\nprohibited from cooking with rotisseries.   b.    \nNot included in the CL Reg 3\nprohibition regarding the operation of rotisseries would be those pieces of\nequipment, often used at movie theaters, amusement parks, and snack bars, that\nheat and maintain the temperature of pre-cooked hot dogs and sausages.  Such\npermitted pieces of equipment include “roller grills” consisting of a\nhorizontal surface composed of a series or rotating cylinders upon which the\nhot dogs are heated and “rotisserie cabinets” where the hot dogs are placed on\n“spikes” or “cradles” and then “orbit” around or past a heat source. (4)  Power-driven food slicers, grinders, choppers, and\nmixers  29\nCFR 570.33(e) prohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from performing occupations\nwhich involve operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or\nrepairing power-driven food slicers and grinders, food choppers, food\nprocessors, food cutters, and food mixers.   a.    \nThese occupations are prohibited\nunder CL Reg 3 regardless of the material being processed by such machines. \nThis prohibition is much broader than that contained in HO 10 (see 75 FR\n28409). b.    \nPower-driven bagel slicers are\nfood slicers under CL Reg 3 and are therefore prohibited.  This prohibition is\nmuch broader than that contained in HO 14 and the enforcement position\ndiscussed in FOH 33h11(e). c.    \nBakery-type mixers  1.    \nCL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and\n15-year-olds from operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling,\nor repairing power-driven food mixers regardless of the product being\nprocessed, the size of the mixer, or the blade or attachment being used.  This\nprohibition is much broader than that imposed by HO 11, Occupations involved in\nthe operation of bakery machines. 2.    \nAlthough HO 11 (see 29 CFR\n570.62(b)(1)) provides an exception that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to operate\ncertain lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top power-driven food\nmixers, this exception does not apply to those under 16 years of age (see\nFOH 33h11(d)(2)d).   d.    \nDairy Queen Blizzard Flavor Treat\nMachine/Whisper Quiet Mix-N-Blend Machine   The\n“Blizzard,” a trademarked product of Dairy Queen, is made from soft ice cream. \nAlthough somewhat similar to a milk shake, the Blizzard is very thick and\ncannot be poured.  The customer selects ingredients, such as chocolate, fruit,\nor different kinds of candy, to be added to the soft ice cream.  All the\ningredients are placed in a cup and then blended or mixed by the Blizzard\nmachine.  Because these machines act as a milk shake blender, a machine\nspecifically permitted by 29 CFR 570.34(i), 14- and 15-year-olds may\noperate both the Dairy Queen Blizzard Flavor Treat machine or the Whisper Quiet\nMix-N-Blend Machine.   (5)  Cotton candy machines.  CL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14-\nand 15-year-olds from operating most standard cotton candy machines. a.    \nThe operator of the cotton candy\nmachine puts sugar crystals into a cylinder in the center of the machine.  The\nsugar crystals are heated by hot air from an enclosed element to a soft liquid\nconsistency.  The liquid sugar is then spun out into a fluff that collects\nwithin the bowl of the machine.  The operator takes a cardboard cone and twirls\nit around just inside the surface of the bowl picking up the spun cotton candy\nuntil the cone is filled to a serving size.   b.    \n29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and\n15-year-old-minors to perform kitchen work and other work involved in preparing\nand serving food and beverages, including the operation of machines and devices\nused in the performance of such work, such as but not limited to, dishwashers,\ntoasters, dumbwaiters, popcorn poppers, milk shake blenders, and coffee\ngrinders. 1.    \nMost cotton candy machines are\ndesigned in such a manner to present few hazards to the operator, and the\noperator is exposed to none of the moving parts of the machine.   2.    \nThis machine operates in a fashion\nsimilar to a popcorn popper, which is a permitted piece of equipment. (6)  Waffle irons a.    \nCL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14- and\n15-year-olds from cooking with electric waffle irons, including those used in\nrestaurants and ice cream shops to make “waffle cones.”  These waffle irons are\nsimilar to electric grills, with solid heating elements powered by\nelectricity.  They do not involve cooking over an open flame, do not operate at\nextremely high temperatures, and their operation does not constitute “baking”\nunder 29 CFR 570.33(h). b.    \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds may\nalso clean such waffle irons as long as the equipment and surfaces do not\nexceed a temperature of 100 °F (see 29 CFR 570.34(i)).  (7)  Two-sided grills a.    \nCL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14- and\n15-year-olds from cooking with electric or gas two-sided grills such as those\nmanufactured by Garland Commercial Industries under the name Master Series\nXpress Grills.  This equipment consists of a standard gas or electric grill\nthat is equipped with electric platen heaters that can be lowered\n(automatically or manually) onto the food product to allow for two-sided\ncooking.  Such equipment operates similar to a waffle iron. b.    \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds may\nalso clean such two-sided grills as long as the equipment and surfaces do not\nexceed a temperature of 100 °F (see 29 CFR 570.34(i)).  (8)  Ice chippers, grinders and shavers a.    \nCL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and\n15-year-olds from operating and tending most power-driven machinery used to\ngrind or shave ice.  Such machines are often used in restaurants, grocery\nstores, concession stands, amusement parks, and industrial settings to process\nice.  They range greatly in size, horsepower, and the amount of ice they can\nprocess per hour. b.    \n“Sno Cone,” “Snow Cone,” and\n“Italian Ice” Machines  1.    \nWH will not, however, assert a\nviolation of CL Reg 3 when 14- and 15-year-olds operate ice grinders and\nshavers that are designed and used to produce “sno cones,” “snow cones,” and\n“Italian ice”—products that consist of a single serving of

<a name=\"OLE_LINK4\"></a><a name=\"OLE_LINK3\">29 CFR 570.33(h</a>) prohibits minors 14 and 15 years of age\nfrom performing most cooking tasks, § 570.34(i) permits such minors to perform\noccupations involved in preparing and serving food and beverages, including\noperating machines used to perform such work.  Machines such youth are\npermitted to operate include, but are not

“Sno Cone,” “Snow Cone,” and Italian ice machines (see\nFOH 33c12(b)(9)).</p><p>(b)  \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds are\nprohibited from operating many other pieces of power-driven equipment used in\nkitchens and food service establishments.  Below are specific pieces of\npower-driven kitchen equipment that are cited in the regulations or upon which\nWH has formally opined.</p><p>(1)  Toasters.  29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and\n15-year-old minors to operate certain machines, including toasters.  </p><p>a.    \nWH has long interpreted the term\ntoaster to mean that type of equipment that was generally found in snack bars\nand lunch counters when CL Reg 3 was issued and used to toast such items as\nslices of bread and English muffins.  This includes such equipment as the two-\nor four-slice “pop-up” toasters similar to those manufactured for home use and\nthe small conveyor-type bread toasters now often found at self-service\nbreakfast buffets (see 75 FR 28409).  </p><p>b.    \nBroilers, automatic broiler\nsystems, high speed ovens, and rapid toaster machines used at quick service\nrestaurants to toast such items as buns, bagels, and muffins—all of which\noperate at high temperatures, often in excess of 500 degrees Fahrenheit—are not\ntoasters under CL Reg 3 and minors must be at least 16 years of age to operate\nthem (see 75 FR 28409).  One rapid toaster that 14- and 15-year-olds are not\npermitted to operate is the Model VCT-200. </p><p>(2)  Broilers, including Automatic Broiler Systems  </p><p>a.    \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds are\nprohibited from performing all baking activities, including operating most\novens, and from cooking with all broilers.  Some electric and gas grills that\nhave solid cooking surfaces on top, are also equipped with a broiler under the\ngrill that takes advantage of the single source of heat (electric element or\ngas flame).  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may cook with such grills, but may not\nuse the broilers.</p><p>b.    \nAutomatic Broiler Systems (see\n29 CFR 570.34(c)).  Fourteen and fifteen year olds are prohibited from\noperating automatic broilers and cooking systems, such as those produced by the\nNeico Automatic Broilers.  NEICO broilers – also called Flexi-Chef® Cooking\nSystems – and other automatic broiler systems use a combination of convection\nand radiant heat to flame broil a wide variety of items.  These items include\nribs, chicken, steak, hamburgers, seafood, nachos, vegetables and breadsticks. \nAutomatic broilers, which can be powered by electric, natural gas, or propane,\noften operate at temperatures in excess of 500 °F.  </p><p>1.    \nAutomatic broilers may operate\nusing a conveyor or system of conveyors.  The product is simply placed on the\nconveyor at the feed-end and it flows through to the discharge-end, flame\nbroiled on both sides at the same time.  </p><p>2.    \nOn some systems, called\nreturn-flow broilers, the product is both fed and returned on the same end of\nthe broiler.  Some automatic broilers also feature up to four independently\ntimed conveyor belts, allowing the user to broil up to four separate items at\nthe same time.  The broilers may also have a “meat holding unit” for limited\nproduct holding after broiling and a “bun-grill” for toasting buns.  </p><p>3.    \nEnforcement experience indicates\nthat these automatic broilers are used in a variety of food service\nestablishments. </p><p>(3)  Rotisseries (see 29 CFR 570.34(c)).  A\nrotisserie is a device that cooks food while it slowly rotates.  Heating\nsources may be electricity, gas, charcoal, or wood.  A rotisserie contains a\nspit fitted with a pair of prongs that slide along its length. Food (usually\nmeat) is impaled on the spit and the prongs (which are inserted on each side of\nthe food) are screwed tightly into place to hold the food securely. Modern\nrotisseries have a motor that automatically turns the shaft, while their\npredecessors relied on human power.  </p><p>a.    \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds are\nprohibited from cooking with rotisseries.  </p><p>b.    \nNot included in the CL Reg 3\nprohibition regarding the operation of rotisseries would be those pieces of\nequipment, often used at movie theaters, amusement parks, and snack bars, that\nheat and maintain the temperature of pre-cooked hot dogs and sausages.  Such\npermitted pieces of equipment include “roller grills” consisting of a\nhorizontal surface composed of a series or rotating cylinders upon which the\nhot dogs are heated and “rotisserie cabinets” where the hot dogs are placed on\n“spikes” or “cradles” and then “orbit” around or past a heat source.</p><p>(4)  Power-driven food slicers, grinders, choppers, and\nmixers </p><p>29\nCFR 570.33(e) prohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from performing occupations\nwhich involve operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or\nrepairing power-driven food slicers and grinders, food choppers, food\nprocessors, food cutters, and food mixers.  </p><p>a.    \nThese occupations are prohibited\nunder CL Reg 3 regardless of the material being processed by such machines. \nThis prohibition is much broader than that contained in HO 10 (see 75 FR\n28409).</p><p>b.    \nPower-driven bagel slicers are\nfood slicers under CL Reg 3 and are therefore prohibited.  This prohibition is\nmuch broader than that contained in HO 14 and the enforcement position\ndiscussed in FOH 33h11(e).</p><p>c.    \nBakery-type mixers </p><p>1.    \nCL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and\n15-year-olds from operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling,\nor repairing power-driven food mixers regardless of the product being\nprocessed, the size of the mixer, or the blade or attachment being used.  This\nprohibition is much broader than that imposed by HO 11, Occupations involved in\nthe operation of bakery machines.</p><p>2.    \nAlthough HO 11 (see 29 CFR\n570.62(b)(1)) provides an exception that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to operate\ncertain lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top power-driven food\nmixers, this exception does not apply to those under 16 years of age (see\nFOH 33h11(d)(2)d).  </p><p>d.    \nDairy Queen Blizzard Flavor Treat\nMachine/Whisper Quiet Mix-N-Blend Machine  </p><p>The\n“Blizzard,” a trademarked product of Dairy Queen, is made from soft ice cream. \nAlthough somewhat similar to a milk shake, the Blizzard is very thick and\ncannot be poured.  The customer selects ingredients, such as chocolate, fruit,\nor different kinds of candy, to be added to the soft ice cream.  All the\ningredients are placed in a cup and then blended or mixed by the Blizzard\nmachine.  Because these machines act as a milk shake blender, a machine\nspecifically permitted by 29 CFR 570.34(i), 14- and 15-year-olds may\noperate both the Dairy Queen Blizzard Flavor Treat machine or the Whisper Quiet\nMix-N-Blend Machine.  </p><p>(5)  Cotton candy machines.  CL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14-\nand 15-year-olds from operating most standard cotton candy machines.</p><p>a.    \nThe operator of the cotton candy\nmachine puts sugar crystals into a cylinder in the center of the machine.  The\nsugar crystals are heated by hot air from an enclosed element to a soft liquid\nconsistency.  The liquid sugar is then spun out into a fluff that collects\nwithin the bowl of the machine.  The operator takes a cardboard cone and twirls\nit around just inside the surface of the bowl picking up the spun cotton candy\nuntil the cone is filled to a serving size.  </p><p>b.    \n29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and\n15-year-old-minors to perform kitchen work and other work involved in preparing\nand serving food and beverages, including the operation of machines and devices\nused in the performance of such work, such as but not limited to, dishwashers,\ntoasters, dumbwaiters, popcorn poppers, milk shake blenders, and coffee\ngrinders.</p><p>1.    \nMost cotton candy machines are\ndesigned in such a manner to present few hazards to the operator, and the\noperator is exposed to none of the moving parts of the machine.  </p><p>2.    \nThis machine operates in a fashion\nsimilar to a popcorn popper, which is a permitted piece of equipment.</p><p>(6)  Waffle irons</p><p>a.    \nCL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14- and\n15-year-olds from cooking with electric waffle irons, including those used in\nrestaurants and ice cream shops to make “waffle cones.”  These waffle irons are\nsimilar to electric grills, with solid heating elements powered by\nelectricity.  They do not involve cooking over an open flame, do not operate at\nextremely high temperatures, and their operation does not constitute “baking”\nunder 29 CFR 570.33(h).</p><p>b.    \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds may\nalso clean such waffle irons as long as the equipment and surfaces do not\nexceed a temperature of 100 °F (see 29 CFR 570.34(i)). </p><p>(7)  Two-sided grills</p><p>a.    \nCL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14- and\n15-year-olds from cooking with electric or gas two-sided grills such as those\nmanufactured by Garland Commercial Industries under the name Master Series\nXpress Grills.  This equipment consists of a standard gas or electric grill\nthat is equipped with electric platen heaters that can be lowered\n(automatically or manually) onto the food product to allow for two-sided\ncooking.  Such equipment operates similar to a waffle iron.</p><p>b.    \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds may\nalso clean such two-sided grills as long as the equipment and surfaces do not\nexceed a temperature of 100 °F (see 29 CFR 570.34(i)). </p><p>(8)  Ice chippers, grinders and shavers</p><p>a.    \nCL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and\n15-year-olds from operating and tending most power-driven machinery used to\ngrind or shave ice.  Such machines are often used in restaurants, grocery\nstores, concession stands, amusement parks, and industrial settings to process\nice.  They range greatly in size, horsepower, and the amount of ice they can\nprocess per hour.</p><p>b.    \n“Sno Cone,” “Snow Cone,” and\n“Italian Ice” Machines </p><p>1.    \nWH will not, however, assert a\nviolation of CL Reg 3 when 14- and 15-year-olds operate ice grinders and\nshavers that are designed and used to produce “sno cones,” “snow cones,” and\n“Italian ice”—products that consist of a single serving of ice which is then covered\nwith flavored syrup.  These machines are designed in such a manner to present\nfew hazards to the operator, and it appears that the operator is exposed to\nnone of the moving parts of the machine.  </p><p>2.    \nMachines included under this\nenforcement position are often found at concession stands at parks, theaters,\nswimming pools, fairs, and other amusement venues.  The machines may be free\nstanding units, table top units, or contained in specially constructed\nsnow-cone carts.  </p><p>3.    \nIce grinding and shaving machines\nincluded under this enforcement position may be electric, gas, or battery\noperated, but the horsepower of the motors may not exceed ½ horsepower.  The\nmaximum output of such machines may not exceed 500 pounds of “snow” per hour.</p><p>4.    \nWH will not charge a violation\nwhen 14- and 15-year-olds operate the ice grinding and shaving equipment\ndescribed in this subsection.  They may also perform limited tending functions\nsuch as loading ice into the machine, cleaning the exterior of the machine, and\ncleaning the compartment that holds the crushed or shaved ice.  Such youth may\nnot assemble or disassemble the machine or perform any work that entails\ncontact with moving parts that grind or shave the ice.</p><p>5.    \nManufacturers whose equipment have\nbeen found to meet the requirements of this enforcement position include\nSnoKonette models 1002, 1003, 1203, 1803, and 1903; Paragon models PA-6133110,\nPA-6133210, and PA-6133410; Echols models GWP-1360, GWP-117, GWP-103, and\nGWP-123.

youth have\nbeen trained and certified by the American Red Cross, or a similar certifying\norganization, in aquatics and water safety.  Section 570.34(l) was incorporated\ninto the Regulation by the 2008 Final Rule and replaces an enforcement position\npreviously adopted by WH.   (1)  The core and defining duty of a lifeguard is to rescue\nswimmers in danger of drowning, often by entering the water and physically\nbringing the swimmer to safety (see 75 FR 28418).  CL Reg. 3 now prohibits the\nemployment of anyone under 15 years of age to perform this core duty; and\n15-year-olds may do so only when properly certified.  (2)  Any employee under the age of 16 whose duties include\nthis core duty—such as a “junior lifeguard” or a “swim teacher aide”—or whose\nemployment could place him or her in a situation where the employer would\nreasonably expect him or her to perform such rescue duties, would be performing\nthe duties of a lifeguard while working is such a position.  For

570.34(l)(2)). (b)  \nWhere 15-year-old lifeguards may\nand may not be employed: (1)  Traditional swimming pools   a.    \nProperly certified 15-year-old\nlifeguards may be employed at traditional swimming pools.  A traditional\nswimming pool means a water tight structure of concrete, masonry, or other\napproved materials located either indoors or outdoors, used for bathing or\nswimming and filled with a filtered and disinfected water supply, together with\nbuildings, appurtenances and equipment used in connection therewith.  b.    \nThe provisions of § 570.34(l)\napply irrespective of who owns, operates, or manages the pool.  Therefore, such\nminors could be employed at hotel pools, apartment complex pools, and homeowner\nassociation pools, as well as community pools.   (2) \nWater amusement parks   a.    \nProperly certified 15-year-olds\nmay be employed as lifeguards at most facilities of a water amusement park.  A\nwater amusement park means an establishment that not only encompasses the\nfeatures of a traditional swimming pool, but also includes such additional attractions\nas wave pools, lazy rivers, baby pools, activities areas,\nand elevated water slides.  b.    \nFifteen- year-olds may serve as\nlifeguards at the wave pools, the lazy rivers, the activities areas, the baby\npools, and at the receiving or splashdown areas of the elevated water slides. c.    \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds may not\nbe stationed at the top of an elevated water slide to monitor the slide\noperations, keep order, and serve as “dispatcher” to ensure patrons properly\nride the slide.  The general prohibition against operating or tending\npower-driven equipment contained in CL Reg. 3 prohibits youth under 16 from\nperforming these “nontraditional” lifeguard duties at the top or on the stairs\nof an elevated slide.  This same prohibition prevents youth under 16 from being\nemployed to operate or tend, or serve as “attendants” on, amusement park rides (3)  Natural environments.  No one under 16 years of age\nmay be employed as a lifeguard at rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, quarries,\nreservoirs, wharfs, piers, canals, oceanside beaches, nor other natural\nenvironments.  (c)  \nThe duties 15-year-old lifeguards\nmay perform include the following: (1)  Rescuing swimmers in danger of drowning, (2)  Monitoring activities at poolside to prevent\naccidents, (3)  Providing swimming lessons, but only if properly\ncertified to do so (see FOH 33d06(e)(3)a below, (4)  Teaching water safety, (5)  Providing assistance to patrons, (6)  Helping maintain order and cleanliness in the pool and\npool areas, (7)  Conducting and officiating at swim meets, (8)  Administering first aid, (9)  Checking in and out items such as towels, and personal\nitems such as rings, watches, and apparel, (10)  Using a ladder to access and descend from a lifeguard\nchair, (11)  Using hand tools to clean the pool and pool area, and (12)  Testing and recording water quality for temperature\nand/or Ph levels, using all of the tools of the testing process including\nadding chemicals to the test water sample. (d)  \nThe duties 15-year-old lifeguards\nmay not perform include the following: (1)  Such youth may not enter or work in any mechanical\nroom or chemical storage area, including any areas where the filtration and\nchlorinating systems are housed. (2)  Such youth may not operate or tend any power-driven\nequipment, including power-driven elevated water slides often found at water\namusement parks and some swimming pools. a.    \nCL Reg. 3 prohibits the employment\nof youths under 16 years of age as dispatchers or attendants at the top of\nelevated water slides performing such tasks as maintaining order, directing\npatrons as to when to depart the top of the slide, and ensuring that patrons\nhave begun their “ride” safely (see § 570.34(l)(2)). b.    \nProperly certified 15-year-old\nlifeguards may be

tending\npower-driven water slides would not apply to those small water slides designed\nfor use by very small children and often located in “baby pools.”  These slides\nnormally rise no more than five or ten feet are accessed by ramps that patrons\nwalk up rather than stairways or ladders.  Properly certified 15-year-old\nlifeguards may tend these little slides designed for very small children. (e)  \nCertification (1)  29 CFR 570.34(l) requires that 15-year-olds be trained\nand certified in water safety and aquatics by the American Red Cross or a\nsimilar certifying agency, before they may be employed as lifeguards or to\nperform the core duties of a lifeguard as discussed in FOH 33d06(a)(1) above. (2)  Normally, the youth will have in his or her custody a\ncertificate documenting that he or she has successfully completed all classroom\nand practical skill sets necessary for certification as a lifeguard.  Such\ncertification will normally be sufficient for purposes of establishing\ncompliance with this portion of CL Reg. 3. (3)  As per § 570.34(l)(2), 15-year-olds who, as part of\ntheir employment, serve as swimming instructors—teaching others how to\nswim—must not only hold proper certification as a lifeguard, but must also be\ncertified as a swimming instructor by the American Red Cross or some other\nrecognized certifying organization. (4)  Once a

[Rev. 599, 12/28/93]","text":"(a)  \nSection 13(c)(2) reads as follows:\n“The provisions of section 12 of this title relating to child labor shall apply\nto an employee below the age of sixteen employed in agriculture in an\noccupation that the Secretary of Labor finds and declares to be particularly\nhazardous for the employment of children below the age of 16, except where such\nemployee is employed by his parent or by a person standing in the place of his\nparent on a farm owned or operated by such parent or person.”  (b)  \nThe 16-year minimum age for\nagricultural employment in occupations declared to be hazardous applies to\ncovered agricultural employment which meets the definition given in Sec 3(f)\nand without regard to whether or not such employment is subject to the MW\nprovided by Sec 6(a)(5). The 16-year minimum age does not depend upon whether\nor not the employment is “outside school hours.” Thus, the 16-year minimum age\nfor such hazardous occupations applies during vacation periods as well as hours\nbefore and after school or on nonschool days.  (c)  \nThe parental exemption from the Ag\nH.O.s in Sec 13(c)(2) from the HO/A applies to the minor’s natural parent or to\na “person standing in the place of his parent”, as long as the employment is on\na farm owned or operated by such parent or person.  (d)  \nOwned by the parent or person\nstanding in the place of the parent includes part ownership as a partner in a\npartnership or as an officer of a corporation which owns the farm if the\nownership interest in the partnership or corporation is substantial.  (e)  \nOperated by the parent or person standing in the place of the\nparent means that the person exerts active and direct control over the\noperation of the farm or ranch by making day-to-day decisions affecting basic\nincome, assigning work, hiring and firing employees and exercising direct\nsupervision of the farm or ranch work. Ranch managers, therefore, who meet\nthese criteria could employ his or her own children under 16 on the ranch they\noperate without regard to the provisions of the HO/A.  (f)  \nThe 18-year minimum age set by the\n17 nonagricultural HOs (see FOH 33h), does not apply to an\nemployee employed in “agriculture” as defined in § 3(f). For example, if a\nminor under 18 is employed in agriculture and works as a driver on a motor\nvehicle, HO 2 does not apply even though the minor may go “in or about” a\nproducing establishment to deliver the farmer’s products.  On the other hand,\nif the minor’s employment does not meet the tests in Sec 3(f), HO 2 would apply\nin the normal manner.  If a minor under 16 is employed in agriculture as\ndefined in Sec 3(f), he or she is subject only to the hazardous occupation\norders in agriculture set forth in (g) below.  (g)  \nThe following\noccupations in agriculture have been declared hazardous by the Secretary of\nLabor for the employment of minors under 16 years of age:  (1) \nOperating a tractor of\nover 20 PTO (power takeoff) horsepower, or connecting or disconnecting an\nimplement or any of its parts to or from such a tractor:  a.    \nFarm tractors overturn\neasily and the operator or passenger may be seriously injured. Serious injuries\nare complicated if the accident occurs in an isolated area and is not\ndiscovered quickly.  b.    \nThe rotating drive\nmechanisms of implements or power takeoff drives inflict serious injuries if\nparts of the body or clothing come in contact with the exposed driveshaft or\nmoving parts.  c.    \nPersons under 16 may\noperate garden-type tractors.  (2) \nOperating or assisting\nto operate (including starting, stopping, adjusting, feeding, or any other\nactivity involving physical contact associated with the operation) any of the\nfollowing machines:  a.    \nCorn picker, cotton\npicker, grain combine, hay mower, forage harvester, hay baler, potato digger,\nor mobile pea viner.  1.    \nThese machines use\nrotary gears, revolving shafts, driving chains, belts, augers, conveyor belts\nand chains, knives, blowers, levers, and hydraulic pistons to grasp, cut,\npound, grind, convey, compress, push, or pull material.  2.    \nThe farm worker\nsometimes comes in contact with the moving parts and is seriously injured when\nhe or she tries to unclog, repair, or adjust the machine when the motor is\nrunning.  b.    \nFeed grinder, crop\ndryer, forage blower, auger conveyor, or the unloading mechanism of a\nnongravity-type self loading wagon or trailer.  1.    \nThese machines, except\nfor some that are fed manually, are similar in construction and operation to\nthose described above, and involve the same hazards. There is an additional\ndanger that if a part of the body is caught by a turning auger, amputation is\nalmost unavoidable.  2.  \nPersons under 16 may\nmove the crop to the person feeding the machine and remove the finished product\nfrom the area; they may load and unload material from other types of conveyors,\nsuch as belt, bucket, or chain.  3.  \nThe unloading of a\nbulk body truck, including machines with self-unloading bulk boxes, meets the\ndescription of this Ag H.O. and is prohibited for minors under age 16. However,\nthe operation of a potato bin piler is permitted for minors under 16 years of age\nworking on farms.  c.    \nPower post-hole\ndigger, power post-driver, or nonwalking type rotary tiller.  1.    \nThe hazard of the\npost-hole digger is the danger of becoming entangled with the rotating drive.\nThe hazard with the power post-hole driver, is a possibility of being struck by\nthe descending ram.  2.    \nPersons under 16 may\nset posts in holes, tamp the earth, attach and stretch wire, install gates, and\nrepair fences.  (3) \nOperating or assisting\nto operate (including starting, stopping, adjusting, feeding, or any other\nactivity involving physical contact associated with the operation) any of the\nfollowing machines:  a.    \nTrencher or\nearthmoving equipment. The hazards of earthmoving or trenching equipment are\nentanglement with moving parts and falling under a moving piece of equipment.  b.    \nForklift. Forklifts\nhave a double hazard of falling loads and overturning. They also accidentally\nmay be driven over the edge of platforms.  c.  \nPotato combine  d.  \nPower-driven circular,\nband, or chain saw. The chief hazards in connection with saws are the danger of\namputation and severe cuts from contact with the cutting edge.  (4) \nWorking on a farm in a\nyard, pen, or stall occupied by a bull, boar, or stud horse maintained for\nbreeding purposes or a sow with suckling pigs, or cow with newborn calf (with\numbilical cord present):  a.    \nHandling these animals\nrequires experience, skill, and strength. If they attack without warning,\nescape is especially difficult from confined areas.  b.    \nThis section does not\nprohibit work with these or any animals in an open area. It does not prohibit\nwork with beef or range bulls and cattle, dairy cattle, or breeding stock on\nthe range.  (5) \nFelling, bucking,\nskidding, loading, or unloading timber with butt diameter of more than 6\ninches:  Workers\nunder 16 are still permitted to work with timber up to 6 inches in diameter,\nwhich includes most fence posts and tier poles. (6)  Working from a ladder or scaffold (painting,\nrepairing, or building structures, pruning trees, picking fruit, etc., at a\nheight of over twenty feet: a.    \nMany severe injuries occur when\nwork is done from a ladder or scaffold at a considerable height. b.    \nThis section does not prohibit\nusing ladders to reach a work site above twenty feet, as long as the work is\nnot done from a ladder or scaffold. (7)  Driving a bus, truck, or automobile when transporting\npassengers, or riding on a tractor as a passenger or helper: a.    \nExposure to traffic while moving\nat considerable speed makes driving a motor vehicle on a public road or highway\nhazardous.  The additional responsibility of carrying passengers makes such\ndriving unsuitable for minors under 16 years of age. b.    \nIn addition, most states will not\nissue a driver’s license for a youth under 16 years of age. c.    \nMinors under 16 may drive a truck\nor automobile on the farm itself.  However, they may not ride on any tractor or\nserve as a helper on any tractor. (8)  Working inside: a.    \nA fruit, forage, or grain storage\ndesigned to retain an oxygen deficient or toxic atmosphere, b.    \nAn upright silo within two weeks\nafter silage has been added or when a top unloading device is in operating\nposition, c.    \nA manure pit, or d.    \nA horizontal silo while operating\na tractor for packing purposes. 1.    \nWhen oxygen is replaced by another\ngas or consumed by fermentation, anyone entering these storage areas is in\ndanger of asphyxiation. 2.    \nIf the top unloading device is in\noperating position in the silo, a person may become entangled in its cutting\nand tearing mechanism and be seriously injured. 3.    \nEmployees under 16 may work inside\nthe non-gas-tight type silo while the unloading device is in a raised position,\nand they may also operate this device from outside the silo. 4.    \nThe hazard involved in operating a\ntractor for packing purposes in a horizontal silo is the danger of overturning. (9)  Handling or applying (including cleaning or\ndecontaminating equipment, disposal or return of empty containers, or serving a\ns flagman for aircraft applying) agricultural chemicals classified under the\nFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 135 et seq.)\nas Category I of toxicity, identified by the word “poison” and the “skull\nand crossbones” on the label or Category II of toxicity, identified by the word\n“warning” on the label: a.    \nMany agricultural chemicals\npresent serious health hazards.  Some have a corrosive effect on body tissue. \nSome affect the central nervous system, causing respiratory failures and many\ncause death by the accumulation of even minute quantities over a prolonged\nperiod. b.    \nThe hazards involved in the job of\nflagman are that the employee must stand in the line of the flight to direct\nthe pilot and also because of the possibility of contamination from the\nchemicals being applied. c.    \nMinors under 16 may handle and\napply fertilizers or chemicals that are not labeled as indicated by this AG H.O. (10)  Handling or using a blasting agent, including but not\nlimited to, dynamite, black powder, sensitized ammonium nitrate, blasting caps,\nand primer cord:   The\nuse of blasting agents requires experience and expertise.  Mishandling can\nresult in accidental detonation, maiming, or loss of life. (11)  Transporting, transferring, or applying anhydrous\nammonia: Vapors\nare very irritating to the eyes and to the respiratory system.  In case of\ncontact with the skin, it may result in severe burns.  Too high a concentration\nof vapors could cause suffocation. (a)  \nThe following are some examples of\nwork activities not affected by the Ag H.O.s.: (1)  Handling chemical pesticides and fertilizers not\nincluded in Item (9) above, (2)  Driving a truck, automobile, or bus on the farm proper\nand serving as helpers on such vehicles, (3)  Loading and unloading trucks, (4)  Operating garden-type tractors, (5)  Picking vegetables and berries, and placing them on\nconveyors or in containers, (6)  Clearing brush and harvesting trees up to 6 inches in\nbutt diameter, (7)  Working from ladders at heights less than 20 feet,\nsuch as picking of most fruits (8)  Working with farm animals, except work with certain breeding\nstock in confined areas,

The 16-year minimum age does not depend upon whether\nor not the employment is “outside school hours.” Thus, the 16-year minimum age\nfor such hazardous occupations applies during vacation periods as well as hours\nbefore and after school or on nonschool days. </p><p>(c)  \nThe parental exemption from the Ag\nH.O.s in Sec 13(c)(2) from the HO/A applies to the minor’s natural parent or to\na “person standing in the place of his parent”, as long as the employment is on\na farm owned or operated by such parent or person. </p><p>(d)  \nOwned by the parent or person\nstanding in the place of the parent includes part ownership as a partner in a\npartnership or as an officer of a corporation which owns the farm if the\nownership interest in the partnership or corporation is substantial. </p><p>(e)  \nOperated by the parent or person standing in the place of the\nparent means that the person exerts active and direct control over the\noperation of the farm or ranch by making day-to-day decisions affecting basic\nincome, assigning work, hiring and firing employees and exercising direct\nsupervision of the farm or ranch work. Ranch managers, therefore, who meet\nthese criteria could employ his or her own children under 16 on the ranch they\noperate without regard to the provisions of the HO/A. </p><p>(f)  \nThe 18-year minimum age set by the\n17 nonagricultural HOs (see FOH 33h), does not apply to an\nemployee employed in “agriculture” as defined in § 3(f). For example, if a\nminor under 18 is employed in agriculture and works as a driver on a motor\nvehicle, HO 2 does not apply even though the minor may go “in or about” a\nproducing establishment to deliver the farmer’s products.  On the other hand,\nif the minor’s employment does not meet the tests in Sec 3(f), HO 2 would apply\nin the normal manner.  If a minor under 16 is employed in agriculture as\ndefined in Sec 3(f), he or she is subject only to the hazardous occupation\norders in agriculture set forth in (g) below. </p><p>(g)  \nThe following\noccupations in agriculture have been declared hazardous by the Secretary of\nLabor for the employment of minors under 16 years of age: </p><p>(1) \nOperating a tractor of\nover 20 PTO (power takeoff) horsepower, or connecting or disconnecting an\nimplement or any of its parts to or from such a tractor: </p><p>a.    \nFarm tractors overturn\neasily and the operator or passenger may be seriously injured. Serious injuries\nare complicated if the accident occurs in an isolated area and is not\ndiscovered quickly. </p><p>b.    \nThe rotating drive\nmechanisms of implements or power takeoff drives inflict serious injuries if\nparts of the body or clothing come in contact with the exposed driveshaft or\nmoving parts. </p><p>c.    \nPersons under 16 may\noperate garden-type tractors. </p><p>(2) \nOperating or assisting\nto operate (including starting, stopping, adjusting, feeding, or any other\nactivity involving physical contact associated with the operation) any of the\nfollowing machines: </p><p>a.    \nCorn picker, cotton\npicker, grain combine, hay mower, forage harvester, hay baler, potato digger,\nor mobile pea viner. </p><p>1.    \nThese machines use\nrotary gears, revolving shafts, driving chains, belts, augers, conveyor belts\nand chains, knives, blowers, levers, and hydraulic pistons to grasp, cut,\npound, grind, convey, compress, push, or pull material. </p><p>2.    \nThe farm worker\nsometimes comes in contact with the moving parts and is seriously injured when\nhe or she tries to unclog, repair, or adjust the machine when the motor is\nrunning. </p><p>b.    \nFeed grinder, crop\ndryer, forage blower, auger conveyor, or the unloading mechanism of a\nnongravity-type self loading wagon or trailer. </p><p>1.    \nThese machines, except\nfor some that are fed manually, are similar in construction and operation to\nthose described above, and involve the same hazards. There is an additional\ndanger that if a part of the body is caught by a turning auger, amputation is\nalmost unavoidable. </p><p>2.  \nPersons under 16 may\nmove the crop to the person feeding the machine and remove the finished product\nfrom the area; they may load and unload material from other types of conveyors,\nsuch as belt, bucket, or chain. </p><p>3.  \nThe unloading of a\nbulk body truck, including machines with self-unloading bulk boxes, meets the\ndescription of this Ag H.O. and is prohibited for minors under age 16. However,\nthe operation of a potato bin piler is permitted for minors under 16 years of age\nworking on farms. </p><p>c.    \nPower post-hole\ndigger, power post-driver, or nonwalking type rotary tiller. </p><p>1.    \nThe hazard of the\npost-hole digger is the danger of becoming entangled with the rotating drive.\nThe hazard with the power post-hole driver, is a possibility of being struck by\nthe descending ram. </p><p>2.    \nPersons under 16 may\nset posts in holes, tamp the earth, attach and stretch wire, install gates, and\nrepair fences. </p><p>(3) \nOperating or assisting\nto operate (including starting, stopping, adjusting, feeding, or any other\nactivity involving physical contact associated with the operation) any of the\nfollowing machines: </p><p>a.    \nTrencher or\nearthmoving equipment. The hazards of earthmoving or trenching equipment are\nentanglement with moving parts and falling under a moving piece of equipment. </p><p>b.    \nForklift. Forklifts\nhave a double hazard of falling loads and overturning. They also accidentally\nmay be driven over the edge of platforms. </p><p>c.  \nPotato combine </p><p>d.  \nPower-driven circular,\nband, or chain saw. The chief hazards in connection with saws are the danger of\namputation and severe cuts from contact with the cutting edge. </p><p>(4) \nWorking on a farm in a\nyard, pen, or stall occupied by a bull, boar, or stud horse maintained for\nbreeding purposes or a sow with suckling pigs, or cow with newborn calf (with\numbilical cord present): </p><p>a.    \nHandling these animals\nrequires experience, skill, and strength. If they attack without warning,\nescape is especially difficult from confined areas. </p><p>b.    \nThis section does not\nprohibit work with these or any animals in an open area. It does not prohibit\nwork with beef or range bulls and cattle, dairy cattle, or breeding stock on\nthe range. </p><p>(5) \nFelling, bucking,\nskidding, loading, or unloading timber with butt diameter of more than 6\ninches: </p><p>Workers\nunder 16 are still permitted to work with timber up to 6 inches in diameter,\nwhich includes most fence posts and tier poles.</p><p>(6)  Working from a ladder or scaffold (painting,\nrepairing, or building structures, pruning trees, picking fruit, etc., at a\nheight of over twenty feet:</p><p>a.    \nMany severe injuries occur when\nwork is done from a ladder or scaffold at a considerable height.</p><p>b.    \nThis section does not prohibit\nusing ladders to reach a work site above twenty feet, as long as the work is\nnot done from a ladder or scaffold.</p><p>(7)  Driving a bus, truck, or automobile when transporting\npassengers, or riding on a tractor as a passenger or helper:</p><p>a.    \nExposure to traffic while moving\nat considerable speed makes driving a motor vehicle on a public road or highway\nhazardous.  The additional responsibility of carrying passengers makes such\ndriving unsuitable for minors under 16 years of age.</p><p>b.    \nIn addition, most states will not\nissue a driver’s license for a youth under 16 years of age.</p><p>c.    \nMinors under 16 may drive a truck\nor automobile on the farm itself.  However, they may not ride on any tractor or\nserve as a helper on any tractor.</p><p>(8)  Working inside:</p><p>a.    \nA fruit, forage, or grain storage\ndesigned to retain an oxygen deficient or toxic atmosphere,</p><p>b.    \nAn upright silo within two weeks\nafter silage has been added or when a top unloading device is in operating\nposition,</p><p>c.    \nA manure pit, or</p><p>d.    \nA horizontal silo while operating\na tractor for packing purposes.</p><p>1.    \nWhen oxygen is replaced by another\ngas or consumed by fermentation, anyone entering these storage areas is in\ndanger of asphyxiation.</p><p>2.    \nIf the top unloading device is in\noperating position in the silo, a person may become entangled in its cutting\nand tearing mechanism and be seriously injured.</p><p>3.    \nEmployees under 16 may work inside\nthe non-gas-tight type silo while the unloading device is in a raised position,\nand they may also operate this device from outside the silo.</p><p>4.    \nThe hazard involved in operating a\ntractor for packing purposes in a horizontal silo is the danger of overturning.</p><p>(9)  Handling or applying (including cleaning or\ndecontaminating equipment, disposal or return of empty containers, or serving a\ns flagman for aircraft applying) agricultural chemicals classified under the\nFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 135 et seq.)\nas Category I of toxicity, identified by the word “poison” and the “skull\nand crossbones” on the label or Category II of toxicity, identified by the word\n“warning” on the label:</p><p>a.    \nMany agricultural chemicals\npresent serious health hazards.  Some have a corrosive effect on body tissue. \nSome affect the central nervous system, causing respiratory failures and many\ncause death by the accumulation of even minute quantities over a prolonged\nperiod.</p><p>b.    \nThe hazards involved in the job of\nflagman are that the employee must stand in the line of the flight to direct\nthe pilot and also because of the possibility of contamination from the\nchemicals being applied.</p><p>c.    \nMinors under 16 may handle and\napply fertilizers or chemicals that are not labeled as indicated by this AG H.O.</p><p>(10)  Handling or using a blasting agent, including but not\nlimited to, dynamite, black powder, sensitized ammonium nitrate, blasting caps,\nand primer cord:  </p><p>The\nuse of blasting agents requires experience and expertise.  Mishandling can\nresult in accidental detonation, maiming, or loss of life.</p><p>(11)  Transporting, transferring, or applying anhydrous\nammonia:</p><p>Vapors\nare very irritating to the eyes and to the respiratory system.  In case of\ncontact with the skin, it may result in severe burns.  Too high a concentration\nof vapors could cause suffocation.</p><p>(a)  \nThe following are some examples of\nwork activities not affected by the Ag H.O.s.:</p><p>(1)  Handling chemical pesticides and fertilizers not\nincluded in Item (9) above,</p><p>(2)  Driving a truck, automobile, or bus on the farm proper\nand serving as helpers on such vehicles,</p><p>(3)  Loading and unloading trucks,</p><p>(4)  Operating garden-type tractors,</p><p>(5)  Picking vegetables and berries, and placing them on\nconveyors or in containers,</p><p>(6)  Clearing brush and harvesting trees up to 6 inches in\nbutt diameter,</p><p>(7)  Working from ladders at heights less than 20 feet,\nsuch as picking of most fruits</p><p>(8)  Working with farm animals, except work with certain breeding\nstock in confined areas, including showing any animal at livestock shows,\nfairs, exhibits, or similar activities when not taking place on a farm,</p><p>(9)  Hand planting and cultivation,</p><p>(10)  Raising and caring for poultry,</p><p>(11)  Milking cows,</p><p>(12)  Processing and storing milk and dairy products,</p><p>(13)  Cleaning barns, equipment storage buildings, chicken\ncoops, etc.,</p><p>(14)  Mowing lawns,</p><p>(15)  Riding, driving, or exercising horses,</p><p>(16)  Picking cotton,</p><p>(17)  Handling of irrigation pipes,</p><p>(18)  Harvesting and

Storage\nOccupations Involving Explosives.","text":"Name: \nOccupations in or about Plants or Establishments Manufacturing or Storing\nExplosives or Articles Containing Explosive Components  Originally\nAdopted:  July 1, 1939 (a)  \nScope of HO 1 (1)  Workers in plants or establishments manufacturing or\nstoring explosives, including articles containing explosive components, are\nespecially subject to accident from explosions despite the progress made by\nmanufacturers and OSHA in developing safeguards.  The finding of the original\ninvestigation accompanying the report was that the accident severity rate for\nexplosive manufacturing was about twice as great as the average for all\nmanufacturing industries in 1936.  The injuries resulting from such explosions\nare often serious, resulting in fatalities or permanent injuries. (2)  This order deals with occupations in plants or\nestablishments engaged in manufacturing, handling, storing, and transporting of\nexplosives, articles containing explosive components, small arms ammunition,\nblasting caps and primers.  This includes fireworks (see FOH 33h01(a)(4)a\nfor the definitions of the terms explosives and articles\ncontaining explosive components). (3)  The order does not apply to the following: a.    \nRetail stores, including the\nstorage of ammunition in gun shops, sporting goods stores, building supplies\nand hardware stores; retail fireworks stands; and other retail establishments.  b.    \nGun clubs, trap and skeet ranges,\nturkey shoots, certain armories, police stations and other such areas where\nonly small arms ammunition is being stored.  c.    \nThe use of explosives in mining\noperations is covered by HOs 3 and 9.  The use of explosives in demolition and\nship-breaking work is covered by HO 15.  The use of explosives in excavation\nwork is covered by HO 17.  Storage of explosives at such sites, however, is\ncovered under HO 1.  (4)  Definitions a.    \nThe terms explosives and articles\ncontaining explosive components mean and include ammunition, black powder,\nblasting caps, fireworks, high explosives, primers, smokeless powder, and\nexplosives and explosive materials as defined in 18 U.S.C. 841(c)-(f) and the\nimplementing regulations at 27 CFR part 555.  The terms include any chemical\ncompound, mixture, or device, the primary or common purpose of which is to\nfunction by explosion, as well as all goods identified in the most recent list\nof explosive materials published by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms,\nand Explosives, Department of Justice.  This list is not intended to be\nall-inclusive and is updated and published annually in the Federal\nRegister pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 841(d).  A copy of the most recent\nversion of the list may be found through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\nFirearms, and Explosive’s Website located at www.atf.gov. b.    \nThe term plant or establishment\nmanufacturing or storing explosives or articles containing explosive components\nmeans the land with all the buildings and other structures thereon used in\nconnection with the manufacturing or processing or storing of explosives or\narticles containing explosive components.  Types of establishments which may\nstore these materials include ammunition depots, dynamite magazines, bunkers,\narmories, and fireworks warehouses. c.    \nThe term nonexplosives areas as\nused in the exception in HO 1 are those which meet all four criteria found in\n29 CFR 570.51(b)(3) and listed below (the criteria are such that ordinarily\nonly areas in large plants or establishments could qualify – a small fireworks plant\nor establishment would not ordinarily cover such a large area that it could\nsustain a “nonexplosives area”): 1.    \nNone of the work performed in the\narea involves the handling or use of explosives. 2.    \nThe area is separated from the\nexplosives area by a distance not less than that prescribed in the American\nTable of Distances for the protection of inhabited buildings.  The American\nTable of Distances, published by the Institute of Makers of Explosives, was\nlast revised in 1991.  The table lists “minimum safe distances” for the\nlocation of explosive storage and manufacturing buildings from inhabited\nbuildings, railways, highways, etc.  These distances vary with the type and\namount of explosive materials. 3.    \nThe area is separated from the\nexplosives area by a fence or is otherwise located so that it constitutes a\ndefinite designated area.  The phrase “or is otherwise located so that is\nconstitutes a definite designated area” was included to bring in any area which\nis located at a great distance from the explosives area, or is on the other\nside of a natural barricade at least comparable to a fence. 4.    \nSatisfactory controls have been\nestablished to prevent employees under 18 years of age within the area from\nentering any area in or about the plant that does not meet the above three\ncriteria.  The painting of a warning on the doors of all buildings containing\nexplosives advising minors under 18 years of age to stay out does not satisfy\nthis requirement.  Such warnings would have no actual restraining effect on\nemployees under 18 years of age and, by themselves, would not constitute a\nsatisfactory control within the intent of 29 CFR 570.51(b)(3). (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED.   Sixteen- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from\nperforming: (1)  All occupations in or about any plant or establishment\n(other than retail establishments and those establishments which manufacture or\nstore small-arms ammunition as described in FOH 33h01(b)(2) below); except 16-\nand 17-year-olds may perform work that does not involve the handling or use of explosives\nin qualifying “nonexplosives areas.” (2)  The following work in plants manufacturing or storing\nsmall-arms ammunition not exceeding .60 caliber in size, shotgun shells, or\nblasting caps when manufactured or stored in conjunction with the manufacture of\nsmall-arm ammunitions:  a.    \nAll occupations involved in the\nmanufacturing, mixing, transporting, or handling of explosive compounds in the\nmanufacture of small-arms ammunition and all other occupations requiring the\nperformance of any duties in the explosives area in which explosive compounds\nare manufactured or mixed. b.    \nAll occupations involved in the\nmanufacturing, transporting, or handling of primers and all other occupations\nrequiring the performance of any duties in the same building in which primers\nare manufactured. c.    \nAll occupations involved in the\npriming of cartridges and all other occupations requiring the performance of\nany duties in the same work room in which rim-fire cartridges are primed. d.    \nAll occupations involved in the\nplate loading of cartridges and in the operation of automatic loading machines. e.    \nAll occupations involved in the\nloading, inspecting, packing, shipping, and storage of blasting caps. (3)  The following work peculiar to the “fireworks”\nindustry. a.    \nHO 1 applies to homeworkers engaged\nin the manufacture of fireworks in their own homes.  Since explosives are\nstored in the home prior to and after assembly, a homeworker’s home would meet\nthe definition of a “plant or establishment

1939</p><p>(a)  \n<b>Scope of HO 1</b></p><p>(1)  Workers in plants or establishments manufacturing or\nstoring explosives, including articles containing explosive components, are\nespecially subject to accident from explosions despite the progress made by\nmanufacturers and OSHA in developing safeguards.  The finding of the original\ninvestigation accompanying the report was that the accident severity rate for\nexplosive manufacturing was about twice as great as the average for all\nmanufacturing industries in 1936.  The injuries resulting from such explosions\nare often serious, resulting in fatalities or permanent injuries.</p><p>(2)  This order deals with occupations in plants or\nestablishments engaged in manufacturing, handling, storing, and transporting of\nexplosives, articles containing explosive components, small arms ammunition,\nblasting caps and primers.  This includes fireworks (see FOH 33h01(a)(4)a\nfor the definitions of the terms explosives and articles\ncontaining explosive components).</p><p>(3)  The order does not apply to the following:</p><p>a.    \nRetail stores, including the\nstorage of ammunition in gun shops, sporting goods stores, building supplies\nand hardware stores; retail fireworks stands; and other retail establishments. </p><p>b.    \nGun clubs, trap and skeet ranges,\nturkey shoots, certain armories, police stations and other such areas where\nonly small arms ammunition is being stored. </p><p>c.    \nThe use of explosives in mining\noperations is covered by HOs 3 and 9.  The use of explosives in demolition and\nship-breaking work is covered by HO 15.  The use of explosives in excavation\nwork is covered by HO 17.  Storage of explosives at such sites, however, is\ncovered under HO 1. </p><p>(4)  Definitions</p><p>a.    \nThe terms explosives and articles\ncontaining explosive components mean and include ammunition, black powder,\nblasting caps, fireworks, high explosives, primers, smokeless powder, and\nexplosives and explosive materials as defined in 18 U.S.C. 841(c)-(f) and the\nimplementing regulations at 27 CFR part 555.  The terms include any chemical\ncompound, mixture, or device, the primary or common purpose of which is to\nfunction by explosion, as well as all goods identified in the most recent list\nof explosive materials published by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms,\nand Explosives, Department of Justice.  This list is not intended to be\nall-inclusive and is updated and published annually in the Federal\nRegister pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 841(d).  A copy of the most recent\nversion of the list may be found through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\nFirearms, and Explosive’s Website located at <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov\">www.atf.gov</a>.</p><p>b.    \nThe term plant or establishment\nmanufacturing or storing explosives or articles containing explosive components\nmeans the land with all the buildings and other structures thereon used in\nconnection with the manufacturing or processing or storing of explosives or\narticles containing explosive components.  Types of establishments which may\nstore these materials include ammunition depots, dynamite magazines, bunkers,\narmories, and fireworks warehouses.</p><p>c.    \nThe term nonexplosives areas as\nused in the exception in HO 1 are those which meet all four criteria found in\n29 CFR 570.51(b)(3) and listed below (the criteria are such that ordinarily\nonly areas in large plants or establishments could qualify – a small fireworks plant\nor establishment would not ordinarily cover such a large area that it could\nsustain a “nonexplosives area”):</p><p>1.    \nNone of the work performed in the\narea involves the handling or use of explosives.</p><p>2.    \nThe area is separated from the\nexplosives area by a distance not less than that prescribed in the American\nTable of Distances for the protection of inhabited buildings.  The American\nTable of Distances, published by the Institute of Makers of Explosives, was\nlast revised in 1991.  The table lists “minimum safe distances” for the\nlocation of explosive storage and manufacturing buildings from inhabited\nbuildings, railways, highways, etc.  These distances vary with the type and\namount of explosive materials.</p><p>3.    \nThe area is separated from the\nexplosives area by a fence or is otherwise located so that it constitutes a\ndefinite designated area.  The phrase “or is otherwise located so that is\nconstitutes a definite designated area” was included to bring in any area which\nis located at a great distance from the explosives area, or is on the other\nside of a natural barricade at least comparable to a fence.</p><p>4.    \nSatisfactory controls have been\nestablished to prevent employees under 18 years of age within the area from\nentering any area in or about the plant that does not meet the above three\ncriteria.  The painting of a warning on the doors of all buildings containing\nexplosives advising minors under 18 years of age to stay out does not satisfy\nthis requirement.  Such warnings would have no actual restraining effect on\nemployees under 18 years of age and, by themselves, would not constitute a\nsatisfactory control within the intent of 29 CFR 570.51(b)(3).</p><p>(b)  \n<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b>.   Sixteen- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from\nperforming:</p><p>(1)  All occupations in or about any plant or establishment\n(other than retail establishments and those establishments which manufacture or\nstore small-arms ammunition as described in FOH 33h01(b)(2) below); except 16-\nand 17-year-olds may perform work that does not involve the handling or use of explosives\nin qualifying “nonexplosives areas.”</p><p>(2)  The following work in plants manufacturing or storing\nsmall-arms ammunition not exceeding .60 caliber in size, shotgun shells, or\nblasting caps when manufactured or stored in conjunction with the manufacture of\nsmall-arm ammunitions: </p><p>a.    \nAll occupations involved in the\nmanufacturing, mixing, transporting, or handling of explosive compounds in the\nmanufacture of small-arms ammunition and all other occupations requiring the\nperformance of any duties in the explosives area in which explosive compounds\nare manufactured or mixed.</p><p>b.    \nAll occupations involved in the\nmanufacturing, transporting, or handling of primers and all other occupations\nrequiring the performance of any duties in the same building in

the\nloading, inspecting, packing, shipping, and storage of blasting caps.</p><p>(3)  The following work peculiar to the “fireworks”\nindustry.</p><p>a.    \nHO 1 applies to homeworkers engaged\nin the manufacture of fireworks in their own homes.  Since explosives are\nstored in the home prior to and after assembly, a homeworker’s home would meet\nthe definition of a “plant or establishment

Occupations.","text":"Name: \nOccupations of Motor-vehicle Driver and Outside HelperOriginally Adopted:  January 1, 1940 (a)  \nScope of HO 2  (1)  Driving a motor vehicle involves a high degree of\naccident risk for persons of all ages, and is particularly hazardous for minors\nbetween the ages of 16 and 18 due to their lack of experience.  Despite the\nprohibitions of HO 2, transportation-related deaths, largely\nhighway incidents, remained the most frequently recorded cause of occupational\ndeaths of 16- and 17-year-olds between 1980 and 2007.  HO 2 applies to all\nemployers subject to the nonagricultural CL provisions of the FLSA and, with a\nlimited statutory exception, specifically prohibits the employment of persons\nunder the age of 18 as motor-vehicle operators and as “outside helpers” on any\npublic road, highway and in or about any mine (including open pit mine or\nquarry), place where logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any\nexcavation covered by HO 17.  However, driving on private property (other than\ndescribed above) is permitted.  These provisions apply whether the employee is\ndriving a personal or business owned-vehicle. (2)  The Drive for Teen Employment Act, effective October\n31, 1998, amended the FLSA by creating § 13(c)(6) and established the\nconditions under which 17-year-olds (but not those under 17 years of age) may\ndrive certain automobiles and trucks on the job.   (3)  Definitions a.    \nThe\nterm motor vehicle shall mean any automobile, truck, truck-tractor, trailer,\nsemi-trailer, motorcycle, or similar vehicle propelled or drawn by mechanical\npower and designed for use as a means of transportation but shall not include\nany vehicle operated exclusively on rails. 1.    \nThe\nabove definition is not dependent upon the source of energy – vehicles may be\npropelled by gasoline, propane, electricity, etc. 2.    \nThis\ndefinition does not require that the motor vehicle be licensed or outfitted\nwith special equipment, nor is the size of the vehicle a factor.  Golf carts,\nall terrain vehicles (ATVs), and riding mowers designed or used as a means of\ntransportation, meet the definition of “motor vehicles” and fall within the\nscope of HO 2 when operated on any public road or highway (see 75 FR 28409).  3.    \nThe\nterm “similar vehicle” includes buses, vans, mopeds, pickup trucks, panel\ntrucks, recreational vehicles, ice-cream and chuck-wagon-type trucks, motorized\ntrail bikes, jeeps, and other all terrain vehicles. b.    \nThe\nterm driver shall mean any individual who, in the course of employment, drives\na motor vehicle at any time.  c.    \nThe\nterm outside helper shall mean any individual, other than a driver, whose work\nincludes riding on a motor vehicle outside the cab for the purpose of assisting\nin transporting or delivering goods. d.    \nThe\nterm gross vehicle weight includes the truck chassis with lubricants, water and\na full tank or tanks of fuel, plus the weight of the cab or driver’s\ncompartment, body and special chassis and body equipment, and payload. e.    \nThe\nterm occasional and incidental driving is now defined in the FLSA as driving\nthat involves no more than one-third of the worktime in any work day and no\nmore than 20 percent of the worktime in any workweek. f.     \nThe\nterm urgent, time-sensitive deliveries means trips which, because of such\nfactors as customer satisfaction, the rapid deterioration of the quality or\nchange in temperature of the product, and/or economic incentives, are subject\nto time-lines, schedules, and/or turn around times which might impel the driver\nto hurry in the completion of the delivery.  Prohibited trips would include,\nbut are not limited to, the delivery of pizzas and prepared foods to the\ncustomers; the delivery of materials under a deadline (such as deposits to a\nbank at closing, or parts to a job site for the completion of an emergency\nrepair job); and the shuttling of passengers to and from transportation depots to\nmeet transport schedules.  Urgent, time sensitive deliveries do not depend on\nthe delivery’s points of origin and termination, and include the delivery of\npeople and things to the employer’s place of business as well as from that\nbusiness to some other location. g.    \nTo\ndefine the term public road, WHD uses the generally accepted definition of a\npublic road as “a road or way established and adopted (or accepted as a\ndedication) by the proper authorities for the use of the general public, and\nover which every person has a right to pass and to use it for all purposes of\ntravel or transportation to which it is adapted and devoted.  The proper test\nin determining whether [a] road is a ‘public’ or ‘private road’ is [the] use to\nwhich such roadway is put, and [the] fact that [the] road has been constructed\nat public expense is not conclusive” (Bush & Burchett, Inc. v. Reich, 117\nF.3d 932, 938 n. 11 (6th Cir. 1997), citing Black's Law Dictionary\n1329 (6th ed. 1990)).  Under this standard, a pathway or road in or\nat the perimeter of a City park would not be considered a public road, if it is\nused only by pedestrians, bicyclists, golf carts, and similar traffic to access\nparts of the park grounds for recreational purposes.  But if the pathway or\nroad is used by automobiles or trucks to traverse the park or to access park\nfacilities for purposes such as delivery of goods, then it would be considered\na public road. (b)   Occupations PROHIBITED (1)  Driving any type of motor vehicle on public roads or\nhighways and in or about any mine (including open pit mine or quarry), place\nwhere logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any excavation\ncovered by HO 17, except as authorized by § 13(c)(6). (2)  Riding outside the cab of a vehicle as an outside\nhelper. (3)  Towing of any vehicles.  (c)  \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED (1)  Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may operate motor vehicles\non private property other than any mine (including open pit mine or quarry),\nplace where logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any excavation\ncovered by HO 17. (2)  Other motorized vehicles to which HO 2 does not apply a.    \nHO 2\ndoes not apply to self-propelled vehicles that are designed to perform work as\ndistinguished from being used “as a means of transportation.”  This includes\ncertain types of riding mowers, farm tractors, bulldozers, road scrapers, and\nother vehicles not suitable for travel on public streets, geared only for\noff-the-road use, and only designed for use on construction sites, grassy areas\nand along walk paths.  When it is necessary to move such vehicles any distance,\nthey are generally loaded on a lowboy-type flatbed trailer and transported from\njob site to job site.  Some of these vehicles, however, may be prohibited under\nHO 17 when used in excavation.  Note:  See “Enforcement positions”\n(FOH 33h02(e)(3)) regarding riding mowers and golf carts that must cross\npublic roads to complete a work assignment. b.    \nTrucks\nthat have equipment permanently mounted on them (such as mobile drilling rigs)\nor equipment that has its own built-in means of transport are considered motor\nvehicles under HO 2 and fall under the prohibitions of the HO when\noperated on public roads.  Some of these trucks and pieces of equipment can\ntravel at speeds in excess of 30 miles per hour.   c.    \nCertain\nelectric carts are used as a means of transportation in large industrial\nplants, and at railroad stations and airport terminals.  Generally, such\nvehicles are outside the scope of HO 2 unless employees use these vehicles as a\nmeans of transportation on a public street.  Thus, 16- and 17-year-old minors\nmay operate motorized vehicles such as riding mowers or golf carts as long as\nthey are not driven on public roads. (d)   Exemptions (1)  HO 2 does not contain an\nexemption for apprentices or student-learners.  Furthermore, none of the\nlimited exemptions applicable to HOs 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17 permit\napprentices or student-learners to drive motor-vehicles as part of their\ntraining programs. (2)  Occasional and\nincidental driving by 17-year-olds.  The Drive for Teen Employment Act, enacted\non October 31, 1998, amended the FLSA to permit 17-year-olds (but not those\nunder 17 years of age) to drive automobiles and trucks as part of their\nemployment if all of the following criteria are met: a.     The automobile or truck does\nnot exceed 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, b.     The driving is\nrestricted to daylight hours, c.     The minor holds a state\nlicense valid for the type of driving involved in the job performed, d.     The minor has\nsuccessfully completed a state approved driver education course, e.     The minor has no records\nof any moving violation at the time of hire, f.      The vehicle is equipped\nwith a seat belt for the driver and any passengers and the employer has\ninstructed the youth that the seat belts must be used when driving the vehicle, g.     The driving does not\ninvolve: 1.     Towing\nvehicles,2.     Route\ndeliveries or route sales,3.     Transportation\nfor hire of property, goods, or passengers,4.     Urgent,\ntime sensitive-deliveries,5.     Transporting more than 3\npassengers, including employees of the employer, 6.     Driving beyond a 30 mile\nradius from the minor’s place of employment, 7.     More than two trips away\nfrom the primary place of employment in any single day to deliver the\nemployer’s goods to a customer (other than urgent, time-sensitive deliveries\nwhich are prohibited), or 8.     More than two trips away\nfrom the primary place of employment in any single day to transport passengers,\nother than employees of the employer, and h.     Such driving is only\noccasional and incidental to the minor’s employment.  This means that the youth\nmay spend no more than one-third of the worktime in any workday and no more\nthan 20 percent of the worktime in any workweek driving. (e)   Enforcement positions (1)  Ambulance attendants Minors 16 and 17 years of age who have completed\nthe necessary training as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and are employed\nas qualified ambulance attendants are not “outside helpers” within the meaning\nof HO 2 and may ride in the rear of the ambulance while attending the patient\nbeing transported. (2)  Cart caddy The operation of battery operated “cart caddy”\nmachines used by grocery stores to move large strings of shopping carts back to\nthe front area of the store would be a permissible occupation for minors 16 and\n17 years of age.  This machine is not considered a “motor vehicle” and does not\nfall within the scope of HO 2.  However, as it is a power-driven machine, its\nuse by 14- and 15-year-olds is prohibited under CL Reg 3. (3)  Golf carts and riding\nmowers a.     Golf carts, riding\nmowers, and similar motorized vehicles fall within the scope of HO 2 if used as\na means of transportation on public roads.  Because these motorized vehicles\nare not “automobiles or trucks, operation of such vehicles would not fall under\nthe limited exemption contained in FLSA § 13(c)(6). b.     There are certain\nsituations where a public road traverses a golf course or other establishments\nwhere motorized vehicles are used off the roadway.  It may be necessary for\ngolf carts, riding mowers, or other motorized vehicles to cross the public road\nin order to reach a particular work site or return to the club house.  Although\na strict interpretation of HO 2 would prohibit those under 18 years of age from\ndriving the carts and mowers across public roads, WH will not assert a\nviolation of HO 2 if the contact with the public road involves only the\ncrossing of that road, and such crossings occur only at marked cross walks and\npathways. (4)  Messengers  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may, under certain\nconditions, be employed as messengers and errand boys/girls by firms other than\npublic messenger services to pick up and deliver messages or packages in\npassenger type vehicles operated by someone other than the minor (see\nFOH 33c(19)(b), see also § 570.34(o)).","html":"<p>Name: \nOccupations of Motor-vehicle Driver and Outside Helper</p>Originally Adopted:  January 1, 1940<p>(a)  \n<b>Scope of HO 2 </b></p><p>(1)  Driving a motor vehicle

is used by automobiles or trucks to traverse the park or to access park\nfacilities for purposes such as delivery of goods, then it would be considered\na public road.</p><p>(b)   <b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  Driving any type of motor vehicle on public roads or\nhighways and in or about any mine (including open pit mine or quarry), place\nwhere logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any excavation\ncovered by HO 17, except as authorized by § 13(c)(6).</p><p>(2)  Riding outside the cab of a vehicle as an outside\nhelper.</p><p>(3)  Towing of any vehicles. </p><p>(c)  \n<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED</b></p><p>(1)  Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may operate motor vehicles\non private property other than any mine (including open pit mine or quarry),\nplace where logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any excavation\ncovered by HO 17.</p><p>(2)  Other motorized vehicles to which HO 2 does not apply</p><p>a.    \nHO 2\ndoes not apply to self-propelled vehicles that are designed to perform work as\ndistinguished from being used “as a means of transportation.”  This includes\ncertain types of riding mowers, farm tractors, bulldozers, road scrapers, and\nother vehicles not suitable for travel on public streets, geared only for\noff-the-road use, and only designed for use on construction sites, grassy areas\nand along walk paths.  When it is necessary to move such vehicles any distance,\nthey are generally loaded on a lowboy-type flatbed trailer and transported from\njob site to job site.  Some of these vehicles, however, may be prohibited under\nHO 17 when used in excavation.  Note:  See “Enforcement positions”\n(FOH 33h02(e)(3)) regarding riding mowers and golf carts that must cross\npublic roads to complete a work assignment.</p><p>b.    \nTrucks\nthat have equipment permanently mounted on them (such as mobile drilling rigs)\nor equipment that has its own built-in means of transport are considered motor\nvehicles under HO 2 and fall under the prohibitions of the HO when\noperated on public roads.  Some of these trucks and pieces of equipment can\ntravel at speeds in excess of 30 miles per hour.  </p><p>c.    \nCertain\nelectric carts are used as a means of transportation in large industrial\nplants, and at railroad stations and airport terminals.  Generally, such\nvehicles are outside the scope of HO 2 unless employees use these vehicles as a\nmeans of transportation on a public street.  Thus, 16- and 17-year-old minors\nmay operate motorized vehicles such as riding mowers or golf carts as long as\nthey are not driven on public roads.</p><p>(d)   <b>Exemptions</b></p><p>(1)  HO 2 does not contain an\nexemption for apprentices or student-learners.  Furthermore, none of the\nlimited exemptions applicable to HOs 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17 permit\napprentices or student-learners to drive motor-vehicles as part of their\ntraining programs.</p><p>(2)  Occasional and\nincidental driving by 17-year-olds.  The Drive for Teen Employment Act, enacted\non October 31, 1998, amended the FLSA to permit 17-year-olds (but not those\nunder 17 years of age) to drive automobiles and trucks as part of their\nemployment if all of the following criteria are met:</p><p>a.     The automobile or truck does\nnot exceed 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight,</p><p>b.     The driving is\nrestricted to daylight hours,</p><p>c.     The minor holds a state\nlicense valid for the type of driving involved in the job performed,</p><p>d.     The minor has\nsuccessfully completed a state approved driver education course,</p><p>e.     The minor has no records\nof any moving violation at the time of hire,</p><p>f.      The vehicle is equipped\nwith a seat belt for the driver and any passengers and the employer has\ninstructed the youth that the seat belts must be used when driving the vehicle,</p><p>g.     The driving does not\ninvolve:</p><p>1.     Towing\nvehicles,</p><p>2.     Route\ndeliveries or route sales,</p><p>3.     Transportation\nfor hire of property, goods, or passengers,</p><p>4.     Urgent,\ntime sensitive-deliveries,</p><p>5.     Transporting more than 3\npassengers, including employees of the employer,</p><p>6.     Driving beyond a 30 mile\nradius from the minor’s place of employment,</p><p>7.     More than two trips away\nfrom the primary place of employment in any single day to deliver the\nemployer’s goods to a customer (other than urgent, time-sensitive deliveries\nwhich are prohibited), or</p><p>8.     More than two trips away\nfrom the primary place of employment in any single day to transport passengers,\nother than employees of the employer, and</p><p>h.     Such driving is only\noccasional and incidental to the minor’s employment.  This means that the youth\nmay spend no more than one-third of the worktime in any workday and no more\nthan 20 percent of the worktime in any workweek driving.</p><p>(e)   <b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  Ambulance attendants</p><p>Minors 16 and 17 years of age who have completed\nthe necessary training as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and are employed\nas qualified ambulance attendants are not “outside helpers” within the meaning\nof HO 2 and may ride in the rear of the ambulance while attending the patient\nbeing transported.</p><p>(2)  Cart caddy</p><p>The operation of battery operated “cart caddy”\nmachines used by grocery stores to move large strings of shopping carts back to\nthe front area of the store would be a permissible occupation for minors 16 and\n17 years of age.  This machine is not considered a “motor vehicle” and does not\nfall within the scope of HO 2.  However, as it is a power-driven machine, its\nuse by 14- and 15-year-olds is prohibited under CL Reg 3.</p><p>(3)  Golf carts and riding\nmowers</p><p>a.     Golf carts, riding\nmowers, and similar motorized vehicles fall within the scope of HO 2 if used as\na means of transportation on public roads.  Because these motorized vehicles\nare not “automobiles or trucks, operation of such vehicles would not fall under\nthe limited exemption contained in FLSA § 13(c)(6).</p><p>b.     There are certain\nsituations where a public road traverses a golf course or other establishments\nwhere motorized vehicles are used off the roadway.  It may be necessary for\ngolf carts, riding mowers, or other motorized vehicles to cross the public road\nin order to reach a particular work site or return to the club house.  Although\na strict interpretation of HO 2 would prohibit those under 18 years of age from\ndriving the carts and mowers across public roads, WH will not assert a\nviolation of HO 2 if the contact with the public road involves only the\ncrossing of that road, and such crossings occur only at marked cross walks and\npathways.</p><p>(4)  Messengers </p><p>Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may, under certain\nconditions, be employed as messengers and errand boys/girls by firms other than\npublic messenger services to pick up and deliver messages or packages in\npassenger type vehicles operated by someone other than the minor (see\nFOH 33c(19)(b), see also § 570.34(o)).</p>"},{"section":"33h03","chapter":"33","section_title":"33h03.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 3—Coal Mine Occupations.","text":"Name: \nCoal Mine Occupations Originally\nAdopted:  September 1, 1940 (a) Scope of HO 3 (1)  The report that established HO 3 found accident rates\n(including death and dismemberment) for adults employed in and about coal mines\nfar exceed accident rates in other industries.  This report did not address\nlong term occupational illnesses such as “black lung.”  As of the last census\nbefore the report was issued (1930), three per cent of workers employed in coal\nmines were under the age of eighteen (approximately 16,000 minors).  Typically,\nif employed underground, the young people worked as “miner’s helpers” loading\ncoal, or as “trappers” or “door boys” opening and closing doors (regulating air\nflow) to allow the passage of coal cars.  If employed above ground, they worked\nas slate pickers, as helpers in repair shops, or in general clean up work.  The\nreport concluded that the risk of injury to youths employed in coal mines was\ngreat due to the rate of accidents involving adults, and due to their lack of\nexperience and good judgment. (2)  HO 3 is industry specific.  Its scope includes all\ntypes of work performed in or about an underground mine, an open-pit (strip)\nmine, or at the surface part of the mining plant that contributes to the\nextraction, grading, cleaning, or other handling of coal.  The scope of this\norder does not cover slate or refuse picking at certain designated areas, and\nwork solely in offices, or in repair and maintenance shops located in the\nsurface area of any coal-mining plant. (3)  Definitions a.    \nCoal shall mean any rank of coal,\nincluding lignite, bituminous, and anthracite coals. 1.    \nLignite coal is a brownish-black\ncoal intermediate between peat and bituminous coal. 2.    \nBituminous coal is of medium age\n(geologically).  It is “soft” and after burning it leaves bitumen—a tar like\nsubstance.  It makes up the majority of the coal reserves in the United States. 3.    \nAnthracite coal is the oldest coal\n(geologically).  It is “hard” and burns clean.  It is found almost exclusively\nin Pennsylvania. b.    \nThe term occupation in or about\nany coal mine shall mean all types of work performed in any underground\nworking, open-pit, or surface part of any coal mining plant, that contribute to\nthe extraction, grading, cleaning, or other handling of coal. c.    \nThe term tipple refers to a place\nwhere, or an apparatus by which, cars of coal are loaded or emptied. (b) Occupations PROHIBITED (1)  All work in underground coal mines, such as:  miner,\nminer’s helper, loader, shearing-machine operator, loading-machine operator,\ndriller, shot firer, motorman, trackman, or timberman, etc. (2)  All work in an open pit coal mine, such as:  miner,\nshovel operator, electrician, etc. (3)  All work on the surface part of an underground or\nopen-pit mine (or mining plant) except that permitted in FOH 33h03(c). (c) Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY BANNED On\nthe surface part of the coal mining plant, 16 and 17 year olds may: (1)  Engage in slate or other refuse picking at a picking\ntable, or at a picking chute in a tipple or a breaker. (2)  Engage in occupations where the work occurs solely in offices,\nor in repair or maintenance shops (which are located above ground). (d) Enforcement positions (1)  Stock clerk working on the premises of a coal mine   This\noccupation is prohibited for 16- or 17-year-olds if it involves moving about\nthe mine premises delivering supplies, crossing railroad tracks, being in the\nvicinity of loading chutes, or otherwise working outside of the warehouse. \nConversely, this work is permitted if it is confined solely to the warehouse\nstructure on the surface part of the mining plant. (2)  Motor-vehicle operator and outside helper HO 3\nprohibits almost all work in or about a mine, which would include the\noccupations of motor-vehicle driver and outside helper.  HO 2 also specifically\nprohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from performing the occupations of motor-vehicle\ndriver and outside helper in or about any mine, including open pit mine or\nquarry.   (3)  Cleaning under a coal tipple or breaker This\nwork is prohibited by HO 3, as is the pining of railroad cars onto the main\nspur track, and the cleaning of railroad cars. (4)  Watchman HO 3\nprohibits 16 or 17 year olds from working as watchmen if they work in or about\nthe surface part of the mining operation (i.e., working around\nrailroad tracks, loading chutes, etc.).  However, if the area where the work is\nperformed is sufficiently removed (one mile or more) from the site of the\nmining operation, then it would not be work “in or about a mine,” and such work\nwould be permissible for 16 and 17 year olds.  For example, 16 or 17 year olds\nmay work as watchmen at the front gate of the mine, or at an office, if they\nare located more than one mile from the site of the mining operation. (5)  Surveying Surveying\nwork to plan future mining fields that is done well in advance of any mining\noperation and at least one mile from current mining operations is not work in\nthe “surface part of any coal mining plant.”  Consequently, such work is\npermitted for 16- and 17-year-olds. (6)  Screening Coal The\nscreening of coal is an occupation prohibited by HO 3. (e) Exemptions There\nare no

HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 4—Forestry Occupations, Logging and\nSawmilling.","text":"Name:  Forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention occupations,\ntimber tract occupations, forestry service occupations, logging occupations,\nand occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or\ncooperage stock mill.  Originally Adopted:  August 1, 1941 (a)  \nScope of HO 4 (1)  The many accidents and injuries in logging made it the\nmost hazardous manufacturing industry at the time of the original order. \nSawmilling ranked second.  This was based on both the frequency with which\naccidents occurred as well as the severity of the resulting injuries.  A\nDecember 1994 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)\nAlert – Request for Assistance in Preventing Injuries and Deaths of Loggers –\nconfirmed the earlier finding of the risks involved in logging.  During the period\nfrom 1980-1989, the National Traumatic Occupational Fatalities Surveillance\nSystem reported 1,492 deaths of workers in the logging industry, resulting in\nan annual fatality rate more than 20 times that for all workers (164 deaths per\n100,000 workers compared with 7 per 100,000 for all workers).  Most of these\ndeaths occurred in four occupational groups:  logging occupations (for example,\nfellers, limbers, buckers, and choker setters), truck drivers, general\nlaborers, and material machine operators.  (2)  HO 4 prohibits, with a few exceptions, the performance\nof all occupations in the logging industry, in sawmills, lath mills, and\ncooperage-stock mills.  HO 4 was amended several times and new sections were\nadded during World War II (on September 11, 1942, and June 24, 1943), to permit\nthe employment of 16- and 17-year-olds in saw filing and certain occupations in\nlogging for the duration of the war and six months afterwards.  (3)  On February 2, 1948, and again on April 15, 1967, HO 4\nwas revised to permit 16- and 17-year-olds to perform specific tasks in\nlogging, logging camps, and outside shake and shingle mills.  (4)  The Department of Labor Appropriations Act, 2004 (PL\n108-199) amended the FLSA by creating a limited exemption from the child labor\nprovisions for minors 14 to 18 years of age who are excused from compulsory\nschool attendance beyond the eighth grade.   a.    \nThe exemption, contained in §\n13(c)(7) of the FLSA, allows eligible youth to be employed by businesses that\nuse machinery to process wood products, but does not allow such youth to\noperate or assist in operating power-driven woodworking machines.   b.    \nThe provisions of FLSA § 13(c)(7)\nimpact CL Reg 3 (see FOH 33c01) and HO 4 (see\nFOH 33h04(d)).  A Final Rule was published on May 20, 2010 (see 75 FR\n28404) that incorporated the provisions of the amended § 13(c)(7) by revising\nsubparts C and E of 29 CFR part 570. (5)  The 2010 Final Rule (see 75 FR 28429) also expanded HO\n4 to prohibit most work in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention,\ntimber tract occupations, and forestry service operations (see 29 CFR 570.54). (6)  Definitions a.    \nthe term all occupations in forest\nfire fighting and forest fire prevention shall include the controlling and\nextinguishing of fires, the wetting down of areas or extinguishing of spot\nfires, and the patrolling of burned areas to assure the fire has been extinguished. \nThe term shall also include the following tasks when performed in conjunction\nwith, or in support of, efforts to extinguish a forest fire:  the piling and\nburning of slash; the clearing of fire trails or roads; the construction,\nmaintenance, and patrolling of fire lines; acting as a fire lookout or fire\npatrolman; and the maintaining of fire fighting equipment.  The prohibition against\nthe employment of youth in forest fire fighting and fire prevention applies to\nall forest and timber tract locations, logging operations, and sawmill\noperations, including all buildings located within such areas. b.    \nThe term all occupations in\nforestry services shall mean all work involved in the support of timber\nproduction, wood technology, forestry economics and marketing, and forest\nprotection.  The term includes such services as timber cruising, surveying, or\nlogging-engineering parties; estimating timber; timber valuation; forest pest\ncontrol; forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention as defined in this section;\nand reforestation.  The term shall not include work in forest nurseries,\nestablishments primarily engaged in growing trees for purposes of\nreforestation.  The term shall not include the gathering of forest products\nsuch as balsam needles, ginseng, huckleberry greens, maple sap, moss, Spanish\nmoss, sphagnum moss, teaberries, and tree seeds; the distillation of gum,\nturpentine, and rosin if carried on at the gum farm; and the extraction of pine\ngum. c.    \nThe term all occupations in\nlogging shall mean all work performed in conjunction with the felling of\ntimber; the bucking or converting of timber into logs, poles, piles, ties,\nbolts, pulpwood, chemical wood, excelsior wood, cordwood, fence posts, or\nsimilar products; the collecting, skidding, yarding, loading, transporting and\nunloading of such products in connection with logging; the constructing,\nrepairing and maintaining of roads, railroads, flumes, or camps used in\nconnection with logging; and other work performed in connection with logging.  d.    \nThe term all occupations in the\noperation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage-stock mill\nshall mean all work performed in or about any such mill in connection with\nstoring of logs and bolts; converting logs or bolts into sawn lumber, laths,\nshingles, or cooperage stock, or other products of such mills; and other work\nperformed in connection with the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle\nmill, or cooperage-stock mill.  The term shall not include work performed in\nthe planing-mill department or other remanufacturing departments of any\nsawmill, or in any planing-mill or remanufacturing plant not a part of a\nsawmill (This work could be prohibited under HO 5 if the minor operated\npower-driven wood working machines). e.    \nThe term all occupations in timber\ntracts means all work performed in or about establishments that cultivate,\nmanage or sell standing timber.  The term includes work performed in timber\nculture, timber tracts, timber-stand improvement, and forest fire fighting and\nfire prevention.  It includes work on tree farms, except those tree farm\nestablishments that meet the definition of agriculture contained in 29 U.S.C.\n203(f).  f.     \nThe terms remanufacturing plant\nand remanufacturing departments as used in (d) above refer to those\nmanufacturing departments of a sawmill where lumber products such as boxes,\nlawn furniture, and the like are re-manufactured from previously cut lumber. \nThe kind of work performed in a remanufacturing plant or department is similar\nto that done in the planing-mill department in that rough lumber is surfaced or\nmade into other finished products.  The term is not intended to denote those\noperations in a sawmill where rough lumber is cut to dimensions.  The mere\ncutting of rough wood into smaller size pieces would not constitute\nremanufacturing under HO 4. (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED  (1)  The following occupations in logging are prohibited: a.    \nLogging engineering—Work involving\nthe felling or bucking of timber, the collecting or transporting of logs, the\noperation of power-driven machinery, the handling or use of explosives, and\nwork on trestles. b.    \nWork in

lumberyard.7.    \nClerical work in yards or shipping\nsheds, such as done by order-men, tallymen, and shipping clerks. (d)  \nExemptions (1)  There is no provision in HO 4 for apprentices or\nstudent-learners.  The logging section of the order was reviewed in 1974 in\nresponse to a request for a student-learner exemption in logging operations. \nIt was determined that the industry had not substantially changed, the hazards\nremained the same, and the request was denied.   (2)  FLSA § 13(c)(7) – Employment of Certain Minors in\nPlaces of Business That Use Machinery to Process Wood Products. a.    \nThe Department of Labor\nAppropriations Act of 2004 amended the FLSA by creating a limited exemption\nfrom the child labor provisions for certain minors 14 to 18 years old which\nallows them to be employed inside and outside places of businesses that use\nmachinery to process wood products (such as sawmills, furniture manufacturers,\ncabinet makers, garden shed and gazebo manufacturers, and pallet shops).   b.    \nWith regard to such\nestablishments, this amendment overrides the general CL Reg 3 prohibitions\nregarding the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing occupations,\nprocessing occupations, and in work places where goods are manufactured or\nprocessed.  It also overrides the HO 4 prohibition regarding the employment of\nyouth in occupations that entail entering the sawmill building.  This\nexemption, however, does not excuse compliance with the remaining CL Reg 3\noccupations standards and all of the CL Reg 3 hours standards in regards to the\nemployment of 14- and 15-year-olds; nor does it excuse compliance with the\nprovisions of all of the other HOs in regards to the employment of youths aged\n14 through 17 (see § 570.34(m)(2)). c.    \nUnder this exemption, contained at\nFLSA § 13(c)(7), an eligible youth is one who is under the age of 18 and at\nleast the age of 14 who by statute or judicial order is exempt from compulsory\nschool attendance beyond the eighth grade.  In addition, the youth must be\nsupervised on the job by an adult relative or by an adult of the same religious\nsect or division as the youth. 1.    \nAn adult\nis someone who has reached his or her eighteenth birthday.  2.    \nA\nrelative, for purposes of this exemption, includes at a minimum a parent or\nperson standing in place of a parent, a grandparent, an aunt or uncle, or a\nsibling. 3.    \nSuch\nsupervision must be close, direct, constant, and uninterrupted (see 29\nCFR 570.54(b)).  d.    \nSuch minors are still prohibited\nfrom operating or assisting in the operation of power-driven woodworking\nmachines by virtue of § 13(c)(7) and HO 5.  Power-driven\nwoodworking machines include all fixed or portable machines or tools driven by\npower and used or designed for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing,\nstapling, wire stitching, fastening or otherwise assembling, pressing or\nprinting wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber (see FOH 33h05(a)(5)a.).  e.    \nIn addition, the employer must\nensure that the minors are protected from wood particles or other flying\ndebris within the work place by a barrier appropriate to the potential\nhazard of such wood particles or flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient\ndistance from machinery in operation.  The minors must also use personal\nprotective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive levels of noise\nand saw dust. Compliance with these provisions will be accomplished when the\nemployer is in compliance with the requirements of the applicable governing\nstandards issued by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration (OSHA) or, in those states where OSHA has authorized the\nstate to operate its own Occupational Safety and Health Plan, the applicable\nstandards issued by the Office charged with administering the State Occupations\nSafety and Health Plan. (e)  \nEnforcement positions (1)  Veneer mills Veneer\nmills expose minors to similar, if not identical, hazards that are present in\nsawmills –\nsaws, sharp blades, heavy logs, hoisting apparatus, cranes, forklifts, as well\nas dust and noise pollution.  Veneer mills are treated the same as sawmills\nunder HO 4.  (2)  Firewood Cutting\nand splitting logs and the collecting, stacking, and loading of firewood are\nconsidered “converting of timber into pulpwood, cordwood, or similar products”\nand therefore this work is prohibited by HO 4 (see WHD Director A.W. Motley's\nletter of May 20, 1959).  The prohibition against the employment of youth under\n18 years of age to cut, split, collect, stack, and load firewood applies to all\ncovered employment—not just work in forestry, sawmilling, or logging. (3)  Power-driven wood chipping machines Occupations in\nconnection with the operation of wood chipping machines when used in the woods\nin logging operations would be subject to the 18-year minimum age under both HO\n4 and HO 14.  Child labor violations involving wood chipping machines, in any\nnonagricultural occupation or industry, will be recorded as being a violation\nof HO 14. (4)  Stump removal Stump pulling using\ntractors in nonagricultural situations is not subject to HO 4. (5)  Christmas trees An ordinary\nhousehold-sized Christmas tree is not considered to be timber, nor is it cut\ninto log lengths or converted into lumber products—therefore, HO 4 does not\napply (see Director of Children's Bureau Industrial Division McConnell's letter\nof October 29, 1942). (6)  Clearing right-of-way for power lines, highways Activities in\nconnection with the clearing of a right-of-way would not be within the scope of\nHO 4 since these are not logging operations.  HO 4 does not cover the clearing\nof land in preparation for highway construction (see Regional Solicitor Barnes'\nmemorandum of June 25, 1959).","html":"<p>Name:  Forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention occupations,\ntimber tract occupations, forestry service occupations, logging occupations,\nand occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or\ncooperage stock mill. </p><p>Originally Adopted:  August 1, 1941</p><p>(a)  \n<b>Scope of HO 4</b></p><p>(1)  The many accidents and injuries in logging made it the\nmost hazardous manufacturing industry at the time of the original order. \nSawmilling ranked second.  This was based on both the frequency with which\naccidents occurred as well as the severity of the resulting injuries.  A\nDecember 1994 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)\nAlert – Request for Assistance in Preventing Injuries and Deaths of Loggers –\nconfirmed the earlier finding of the risks involved in logging.  During the period\nfrom 1980-1989, the National Traumatic Occupational Fatalities Surveillance\nSystem reported 1,492 deaths of workers in the logging industry, resulting in\nan annual fatality rate more than 20 times that for all workers (164 deaths per\n100,000 workers compared with 7 per 100,000 for all workers).  Most of these\ndeaths occurred in four occupational groups:  logging occupations (for example,\nfellers, limbers, buckers, and choker setters), truck drivers, general\nlaborers, and material machine operators. </p><p>(2)  HO 4 prohibits, with a few exceptions, the performance\nof all occupations in the logging industry, in sawmills, lath mills, and\ncooperage-stock mills.  HO 4 was amended several times and new sections were\nadded during World War II (on September 11, 1942, and June 24, 1943), to permit\nthe employment of 16- and 17-year-olds in saw filing and certain occupations in\nlogging for the duration of the war and six months afterwards. </p><p>(3)  On February 2, 1948, and again on April 15, 1967, HO 4\nwas revised to permit 16- and 17-year-olds to perform specific tasks in\nlogging, logging camps, and outside shake and shingle mills. </p><p>(4)  The Department of Labor Appropriations Act, 2004 (PL\n108-199) amended the FLSA by creating a limited exemption from the child labor\nprovisions for minors 14 to 18 years of age who are excused from compulsory\nschool attendance beyond the eighth grade.  </p><p>a.    \nThe exemption, contained in §\n13(c)(7) of the FLSA, allows eligible youth to be employed by businesses that\nuse machinery to process wood products, but does not allow such youth to\noperate or assist in operating power-driven woodworking machines.  </p><p>b.    \nThe provisions of FLSA § 13(c)(7)\nimpact CL Reg 3 (see FOH 33c01) and HO 4 (see\nFOH 33h04(d)).  A Final Rule was published on May 20, 2010 (see 75 FR\n28404) that incorporated the provisions of the amended § 13(c)(7) by revising\nsubparts C and E of 29 CFR part 570.</p><p>(5)  The 2010 Final Rule (see 75 FR 28429) also expanded HO\n4 to prohibit most work in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention,\ntimber tract occupations, and forestry service operations (see 29 CFR 570.54).</p><p>(6)  Definitions</p><p>a.    \nthe term all occupations in forest\nfire fighting and forest fire prevention shall include the controlling and\nextinguishing of fires, the wetting down of areas or extinguishing of spot\nfires, and the patrolling of burned areas to assure the fire has been extinguished. \nThe term shall also include the following tasks when performed in conjunction\nwith, or in support of, efforts to extinguish a forest fire:  the piling and\nburning of slash; the clearing of fire trails or roads; the construction,\nmaintenance, and patrolling of fire lines; acting as a fire lookout or fire\npatrolman; and the maintaining of fire fighting equipment.  The prohibition against\nthe employment of youth in forest fire fighting and fire prevention applies to\nall forest and timber tract locations, logging operations, and sawmill\noperations, including all buildings located within such areas.</p><p>b.    \nThe term all occupations in\nforestry services shall mean all work involved in the support of timber\nproduction, wood technology, forestry economics and marketing, and forest\nprotection.  The term includes such services as timber cruising, surveying, or\nlogging-engineering parties; estimating timber; timber valuation; forest pest\ncontrol; forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention as defined in this section;\nand reforestation.  The term shall not include work in forest nurseries,\nestablishments primarily engaged in growing trees for purposes of\nreforestation.  The term shall not include the gathering of forest products\nsuch as balsam needles, ginseng, huckleberry greens, maple sap, moss, Spanish\nmoss, sphagnum moss, teaberries, and tree seeds; the distillation of gum,\nturpentine, and rosin if carried on at the gum farm; and the extraction of pine\ngum.</p><p>c.    \nThe term all occupations in\nlogging shall mean all work performed in conjunction with the felling of\ntimber; the bucking or converting of timber into logs, poles, piles, ties,\nbolts, pulpwood, chemical wood, excelsior wood, cordwood, fence posts, or\nsimilar products; the collecting, skidding, yarding, loading, transporting and\nunloading of such products in connection with logging; the constructing,\nrepairing and maintaining of roads, railroads, flumes, or camps used in\nconnection with logging; and other work performed in connection with logging. </p><p>d.    \nThe term all occupations in the\noperation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage-stock mill\nshall mean all work performed in or about any such mill in connection with\nstoring of logs and bolts; converting logs or bolts into sawn lumber, laths,\nshingles, or cooperage stock, or other products of such mills; and other work\nperformed in connection with the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle\nmill, or cooperage-stock mill.  The term shall not include work performed in\nthe planing-mill department or other remanufacturing departments of any\nsawmill, or in any planing-mill or remanufacturing plant not a part of a\nsawmill (This work could be prohibited under HO 5 if the minor operated\npower-driven wood working machines).</p><p>e.    \nThe term all occupations in timber\ntracts means all work performed in or about establishments that cultivate,\nmanage or sell standing timber.  The term includes work performed in timber\nculture, timber tracts, timber-stand improvement, and forest fire fighting and\nfire prevention.  It includes work on tree farms, except those tree farm\nestablishments that meet the definition of agriculture contained in 29 U.S.C.\n203(f). </p><p>f.     \nThe terms remanufacturing plant\nand remanufacturing departments as used in (d) above refer to those\nmanufacturing departments of a sawmill where lumber products such as boxes,\nlawn furniture, and the like are re-manufactured from previously cut lumber. \nThe kind of work performed in a remanufacturing plant or department is similar\nto that done in the planing-mill department in that rough lumber is surfaced or\nmade into other finished products.  The term is not intended to denote those\noperations in a sawmill where rough lumber is cut to dimensions.  The mere\ncutting of rough wood into smaller size pieces would not constitute\nremanufacturing under HO 4.</p><p>(b)  \n<b>Occupations PROHIBITED </b></p><p>(1)  The following occupations in logging are prohibited:</p><p>a.    \nLogging

lumberyard.</p><p>7.    \nClerical work in yards or shipping\nsheds, such as done by order-men, tallymen, and shipping clerks.</p><p>(d)  \n<b>Exemptions</b></p><p>(1)  There is no provision in HO 4 for apprentices or\nstudent-learners.  The logging section of the order was reviewed in 1974 in\nresponse to a request for a student-learner exemption in logging operations. \nIt was determined that the industry had not substantially changed, the hazards\nremained the same, and the request was denied.  </p><p>(2)  FLSA § 13(c)(7) – Employment of Certain Minors in\nPlaces of Business That Use Machinery to Process Wood Products.</p><p>a.    \nThe Department of Labor\nAppropriations Act of 2004 amended the FLSA by creating a limited exemption\nfrom the child labor provisions for certain minors 14 to 18 years old which\nallows them to be employed inside and outside places of businesses that use\nmachinery to process wood products (such as sawmills, furniture manufacturers,\ncabinet makers, garden shed and gazebo manufacturers, and pallet shops).  </p><p>b.    \nWith regard to such\nestablishments, this amendment overrides the general CL Reg 3 prohibitions\nregarding the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing occupations,\nprocessing occupations, and in work places where goods are manufactured or\nprocessed.  It also overrides the HO 4 prohibition regarding the employment of\nyouth in occupations that entail entering the sawmill building.  This\nexemption, however, does not excuse compliance with the remaining CL Reg 3\noccupations standards and all of the CL Reg 3 hours standards in regards to the\nemployment of 14- and 15-year-olds; nor does it excuse compliance with the\nprovisions of all of the other HOs in regards to the employment of youths aged\n14 through 17 (see § 570.34(m)(2)).</p><p>c.    \nUnder this exemption, contained at\nFLSA § 13(c)(7), an eligible youth is one who is under the age of 18 and at\nleast the age of 14 who by statute or judicial order is exempt from compulsory\nschool attendance beyond the eighth grade.  In addition, the youth must be\nsupervised on the job by an adult relative or by an adult of the same religious\nsect or division as the youth.</p><p>1.    \nAn adult\nis someone who has reached his or her eighteenth birthday. </p><p>2.    \nA\nrelative, for purposes of this exemption, includes at a minimum a parent or\nperson standing in place of a parent, a grandparent, an aunt or uncle, or a\nsibling.</p><p>3.    \nSuch\nsupervision must be close, direct, constant, and uninterrupted (see 29\nCFR 570.54(b)). </p><p>d.    \nSuch minors are still prohibited\nfrom operating or assisting in the operation of power-driven woodworking\nmachines by virtue of § 13(c)(7) and HO 5.  Power-driven\nwoodworking machines include all fixed or portable machines or tools driven by\npower and used or designed for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing,\nstapling, wire stitching, fastening or otherwise assembling, pressing or\nprinting wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber (see FOH 33h05(a)(5)a.). </p><p>e.    \nIn addition, the employer must\nensure that the minors are protected from wood particles or other flying\ndebris within the work place by a barrier appropriate to the potential\nhazard of such wood particles or flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient\ndistance from machinery in operation.  The minors must also use personal\nprotective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive levels of noise\nand saw dust. Compliance with these provisions will be accomplished when the\nemployer is in compliance with the requirements of the applicable governing\nstandards issued by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration (OSHA) or, in those states where OSHA has authorized the\nstate to operate its own Occupational Safety and Health Plan, the applicable\nstandards issued by the Office charged with administering the State Occupations\nSafety and Health Plan.</p><p>(e)  \n<b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  Veneer mills</p><p>Veneer\nmills expose minors to similar, if not identical, hazards that are present in\nsawmills –\nsaws, sharp blades, heavy logs, hoisting apparatus, cranes, forklifts, as well\nas dust and noise pollution.  Veneer mills are treated the same as sawmills\nunder HO 4. </p><p>(2)  Firewood</p><p>Cutting\nand splitting logs and the collecting, stacking, and loading of firewood are\nconsidered “converting of timber into pulpwood, cordwood, or similar products”\nand therefore this work is prohibited by HO 4 (see WHD Director A.W. Motley's\nletter of May 20, 1959).  The prohibition against the employment of youth under\n18 years of age to cut, split, collect, stack, and load firewood applies to all\ncovered employment—not just work in forestry, sawmilling, or logging.</p><p>(3)  Power-driven wood chipping machines</p><p>Occupations in\nconnection with the operation of wood chipping machines when used in the woods\nin logging operations would be subject to the 18-year minimum age under both HO\n4 and HO 14.  Child labor violations involving wood chipping machines, in any\nnonagricultural occupation or industry, will be recorded as being a violation\nof HO 14.</p><p>(4)  Stump removal</p><p>Stump pulling using\ntractors in nonagricultural situations is not subject to HO 4.</p><p>(5)  Christmas trees</p><p>An ordinary\nhousehold-sized Christmas tree is not considered to be timber, nor is it cut\ninto log lengths or converted into lumber products—therefore, HO 4 does not\napply (see Director of Children's Bureau Industrial Division McConnell's letter\nof October 29, 1942).</p><p>(6)  Clearing right-of-way for power lines, highways</p><p>Activities in\nconnection with the clearing of a right-of-way would not be within the scope of\nHO 4 since these are not logging operations.  HO 4 does not cover the clearing\nof land in preparation for highway construction (see Regional Solicitor Barnes'\nmemorandum of June 25, 1959). </p>"},{"section":"33h05","chapter":"33","section_title":"33h05.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 5—Power-Driven Woodworking Machine Operations.","text":"Name:     Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven\nwood-working machines. Originally Adopted:  August 1, 1941 (a)  \nScope of HO 5 (1)  Power-driven woodworking machines are among the most\nhazardous of all machine tools. Although great strides have been made by\nmanufacturers and OSHA to improve the safety of such machines through design\nchanges and guarding, the risk of injury to operators or workers assisting to\noperate such machines has not been eliminated.  Several hazardous factors are\ninherent to woodworking machines—extremely high speeds of operation, sharpness\nof cutting tools, and the lightness of material being cut making “kick-backs”\npossible.  The fact that many woodworking machines are hand fed increases the\nhazards.     (2)  This order is very broad in scope and is applied on a\nmachine basis.  Basically, if a minor, while performing covered employment, is\noperating, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and/or cleaning a\npower-driven wood working machine, HO 5 most likely applies. (3)  HO 5 does not apply when the machinery or tools are\ndesigned to be used, and are used exclusively, on materials other than\nwood—such as metal, plastic or stone.  Another HO (such as HO 8, 14, 16 or 17)\nmay prohibit such work. (4)  HO 5 applies in any industries where power-driven\nwoodworking tools are used—including furniture plants; sawmills, cabinet makers\nand other woodworking plants and shops; construction sites; packing sheds;\nretail and service establishments such as hardware and lumber stores; state and\nlocal government entities; and other industries which use power-driven\nwoodworking machines, but which may not directly manufacture wood products.  Even\nthough FLSA § 13(c)(7) exempts certain minors 14 to 17 years of age from\nthe HO 4 prohibition concerning the performance of work that entails entering a\nsawmill building, the HO 5 prohibitions regarding operating and assisting to\noperate power-driven woodworking machines are applicable to the employment of\nthose youth who may now legally work in a sawmill. (5)  Definitions a.    \nThe term power-driven woodworking\nmachine shall mean all fixed or portable machines or tools driven by power and\nused or designed for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing, stapling,\nwire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing, or printing wood,\nveneer, trees, logs, or lumber.  This definition is broad and includes machines\nused at the time the order was issued as well as all power-driven woodworking\nmachines developed in subsequent years.  It may also apply to multiple-use\nwoodworking machines as well as those designed for a single woodworking\npurpose.  A machine that was designed to be used on wood is prohibited by HO 5\neven when used to cut, shape, form, etc., a material other than wood. b.    \nThe term driven by power shall\nmean machines driven by electrical, animal, mechanical, water, or other power\nsuch as steam or hydraulic.  It also includes battery-operated and pneumatic-operated\nmachines and tools, but does not apply to machines or tools driven by foot or\nhand power, such as foot-powered jig saws or hand-operated saws or drills. c.    \nThe term off-bearing shall mean\nthe removal of material or refuse directly from a saw table or from the point\nof operation.  Operations not considered as off-bearing within the intent of HO\n5 include: 1.    \nThe removal of material or refuse\nfrom a circular saw or guillotine-action veneer clipper where the material or\nrefuse has been conveyed away from the saw table or point of operation by a\ngravity chute or by some mechanical means such as a moving belt or expulsion\nroller, and 2.    \nThe following operations when they\ndo not involve the removal of material or refuse directly from a saw or from\nthe point of operation: A.   \nThe carrying, moving, or\ntransporting of materials from one machine to another or from one part of a\nplant to another, B.   \nThe piling, stacking, or arranging\nof materials for feeding into a machine by another person, and C.   \nThe sorting, tying, bundling or\nloading of materials. (6)  The following examples of power-driven machines and\ntools, when used for “cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing, stapling,\nwire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing, or printing wood,\nveneer, trees, logs, or lumber” are subject to HO 5.  This list is not\nall-inclusive – other machines exist or may be developed which meet the\ndefinition of power-driven woodworking machines: a.    \nCutting – circular saw, band saw,\njig saw, drag saw, chain saw, veneer clipper. b.    \nShaping and forming – shaper,\nmolder, heel turner, lathe, tenoner, mortiser, sticker, drill, boring machine,\nhole cutter. c.    \nSurfacing – planer, jointer,\nsander, barker. d.    \nNailing – nailer, box nailer,\ncleat nailer, roofing gun, drywall gun (when used to attach drywall to wood\nstuds), siding gun, finishing nail gun. e.    \nStapling – stapler. f.     \nWire stitching – wire stitcher,\nberry-basket machine, bushel-tub machine. g.    \nFastening, or otherwise assembling\n– corrugator or other similar type machine for fastening two pieces of wood\ntogether by means of a metallic fastener of some type. h.    \nPressing – veneer press, boxboard\nsqueezer, and printing press used on wood. (7)  HO 5 prohibits minors from operating power-driven\nwoodworking equipment in sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, and cooperage\nstock mills—industries that are covered by HO 4.  HO 5 (rather than HO 4)\napplies to the planing-mill department or other re-manufacturing departments of\nthese enterprises when contained in buildings separate from the sawmill, lath\nmill, shingle mill or cooperage stock mill.  HO 5 also applies to the\nemployment of minors between the ages of 14 and 17 who, although now permitted\nto work in sawmills because of the exemption contained in FLSA § 13(c)(7),\nare found to have operated or assisted in the operation of, power-driven\nwoodworking machines. (8)  Guards.  The fact that a machine is guarded has no\neffect on the application of HO 5.  Woodworking machines are the most difficult\nto guard and guards alone cannot be relied upon to protect minors from the\nhazards of woodworking machines.  (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED (1)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the\noccupation of operating power-driven woodworking machines, including\nsupervising or controlling the operation of such machines, feeding material\ninto such machines, and helping the operator to feed material into such\nmachines. a.    \nThe occupations of operating\nwoodworking machines includes starting and stopping the machine, adjusting for\nthe type of work being performed, and placing the wood stock on the machine. \nMachines may be automatic, hand fed or power-fed.  b.    \nHO 5 does not prohibit these\nminors from placing materials on a moving chain or in a hopper or slide for\nautomatic feeding. (2)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the\noccupation of setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning\npower-driven woodworking machines. (3)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the\noccupation of off-bearing (unloading materials) from circular saws when the\nmaterial is not conveyed away from the machine by some mechanical means. (4)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the\noccupation of off-bearing (unloading materials) from guillotine-action veneer\nclippers when the material is not conveyed away from the point of operation by\na moving belt or gravity chain. (5)  The following is a partial list of power-driven\nwoodworking machines prohibited by HO 5. This equipment may be stationary or\nportable and may be powered by batteries: a.     Band saws.b.     Circular saws (table saws, swing\nsaws, portable saws, etc.).c.    \nSurfacing machines (planers,\nshapers, jointers, molders, matchers, stickers, panel raisers, tenoners, etc.). d.     Lathes.e.     Drills, boring machines, mortisers.f.     \nSanding machines (belt sanders,\ndisc

wood. i.     \nWood chippers when used to shape\nthe wood for pressing into fiberboard such as in mills. j.      Veneer lathe.k.     Veneer clipper.l.      Veneer press. m.   Nail guns (as used to attach drywall\nto wood studs, roofing materials to wooden roof decks, siding to studs,\nmillwork to doors, windows, corners, rails, etc.).n.     Power-line AO nailer used to attach\nwire to power poles.o.    \nChuckers used for tapering one end\nof a wooden handle, and “threaders” used to cut a screw thread on the other end\nfor later insertion into the threaded hole of a brush or broom. p.     Air clamps used to assemble\nfurniture.q.    \nRouters designed to be used on\nwood and used to finish countertops, molding and other wood products. r.     \nStruct-O-Matic and similar\nmachines used to press clamps into trusses during the manufacturing\npre-assembled roofing trusses.  (c)  \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED (1)  The following work in a planing-mill, box factory, or\nother remanufacturing department is permitted: a.    \nOff-bearing or tailing from: 1.     Band saws.2.    \nCircular saws when the material is\nconveyed away from the saw table by some mechanical means such as an expulsion\nroller (cleat saw), moving belt, or gravity chute. 3.     Planers, molders, or other surfacing\nmachines.4.     Sanding machines.5.     Nailing or wire-stitching machines.6.     Presses, such as glue presses and\nboxboard squeezers. b.    \nPlacing material on a moving chain\nor in hopper or slide for automatic feeding of machines so equipped, such as: 1.

spreader.3.     Veneer drier.d.    \nCarrying or moving material from\none machine to another or otherwise handling or shipping veneer. (d)  \nExemptions  HO 5 does provide an exemption for apprentices and student-learners. \nThere are no other exemptions applicable.   (e)  \nEnforcement positions (1)  Chain saws HO 14 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from operating chain\nsaws—regardless of the material being processed.  HO 5 also prohibits the\noperation of chain saws to cut wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber because\nchain saws, when used as such, are

power-driven\nwood-working machines.</p><p>Originally Adopted:  August 1, 1941</p><p>(a)  \n<b>Scope of HO 5</b></p><p>(1)  Power-driven woodworking machines are among the most\nhazardous of all machine tools. Although great strides have been made by\nmanufacturers and OSHA to improve the safety of such machines through design\nchanges and guarding, the risk of injury to operators or workers assisting to\noperate such machines has not been eliminated.  Several hazardous factors are\ninherent to woodworking machines—extremely high speeds of operation, sharpness\nof cutting tools, and the lightness of material being cut making “kick-backs”\npossible.  The fact that many woodworking machines are hand fed increases the\nhazards.    </p><p>(2)  This order is very broad in scope and is applied on a\nmachine basis.  Basically, if a minor, while performing covered employment, is\noperating, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and/or cleaning a\npower-driven wood working machine, HO 5 most likely applies.</p><p>(3)  HO 5 does not apply when the machinery or tools are\ndesigned to be used, and are used exclusively, on materials other than\nwood—such as metal, plastic or stone.  Another HO (such as HO 8, 14, 16 or 17)\nmay prohibit such work.</p><p>(4)  HO 5 applies in any industries where power-driven\nwoodworking tools are used—including furniture plants; sawmills, cabinet makers\nand other woodworking plants and shops; construction sites; packing sheds;\nretail and service establishments such as hardware and lumber stores; state and\nlocal government entities; and other industries which use power-driven\nwoodworking machines, but which may not directly manufacture wood products.  Even\nthough FLSA § 13(c)(7) exempts certain minors 14 to 17 years of age from\nthe HO 4 prohibition concerning the performance of work that entails entering a\nsawmill building, the HO 5 prohibitions regarding operating and assisting to\noperate power-driven woodworking machines are applicable to the employment of\nthose youth who may now legally work in a sawmill.</p><p>(5)  Definitions</p><p>a.    \nThe term power-driven woodworking\nmachine shall mean all fixed or portable machines or tools driven by power and\nused or designed for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing, stapling,\nwire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing, or printing wood,\nveneer, trees, logs, or lumber.  This definition is broad and includes machines\nused at the time the order was issued as well as all power-driven woodworking\nmachines developed in subsequent years.  It may also apply to multiple-use\nwoodworking machines as well as those designed for a single woodworking\npurpose.  A machine that was designed to be used on wood is prohibited by HO 5\neven when used to cut, shape, form, etc., a material other than wood.</p><p>b.    \nThe term driven by power shall\nmean machines driven by electrical, animal, mechanical, water, or other power\nsuch as steam or hydraulic.  It also includes battery-operated and pneumatic-operated\nmachines and tools, but does not apply to machines or tools driven by foot or\nhand power, such as foot-powered jig saws or hand-operated saws or drills.</p><p>c.    \nThe term off-bearing shall mean\nthe removal of material or refuse directly from a saw table or from the point\nof operation.  Operations not considered as off-bearing within the intent of HO\n5 include:</p><p>1.    \nThe removal of material or refuse\nfrom a circular saw or guillotine-action veneer clipper where the material or\nrefuse has been conveyed away from the saw table or point of operation by a\ngravity chute or by some mechanical means such as a moving belt or expulsion\nroller, and</p><p>2.    \nThe following operations when they\ndo not involve the removal of material or refuse directly from a saw or from\nthe point of operation:</p><p>A.   \nThe carrying, moving, or\ntransporting of materials from one machine to another or from one part of a\nplant to another,</p><p>B.   \nThe piling, stacking, or arranging\nof materials for feeding into a machine by another person, and</p><p>C.   \nThe sorting, tying, bundling or\nloading of materials.</p><p>(6)  The following examples of power-driven machines and\ntools, when used for “cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing, stapling,\nwire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing, or printing wood,\nveneer, trees, logs, or lumber” are subject to HO 5.  This list is not\nall-inclusive – other machines exist or may be developed which meet the\ndefinition of power-driven woodworking machines:</p><p>a.    \nCutting – circular saw, band saw,\njig saw, drag saw, chain saw, veneer clipper.</p><p>b.    \nShaping and forming – shaper,\nmolder, heel turner, lathe, tenoner, mortiser, sticker, drill, boring machine,\nhole cutter.</p><p>c.    \nSurfacing – planer, jointer,\nsander, barker.</p><p>d.    \nNailing – nailer, box nailer,\ncleat nailer, roofing gun, drywall gun (when used to attach drywall to wood\nstuds), siding gun, finishing nail gun.</p><p>e.    \nStapling – stapler.</p><p>f.     \nWire stitching – wire stitcher,\nberry-basket machine, bushel-tub machine.</p><p>g.    \nFastening, or otherwise assembling\n– corrugator or other similar type machine for fastening two pieces of wood\ntogether by means of a metallic fastener of some type.</p><p>h.    \nPressing – veneer press, boxboard\nsqueezer, and printing press used on wood.</p><p>(7)  HO 5 prohibits minors from operating power-driven\nwoodworking equipment in sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, and cooperage\nstock mills—industries that are covered by HO 4.  HO 5 (rather than HO 4)\napplies to the planing-mill department or other re-manufacturing departments of\nthese enterprises when contained in buildings separate from the sawmill, lath\nmill, shingle mill or cooperage stock mill.  HO 5 also applies to the\nemployment of minors between the ages of 14 and 17 who, although now permitted\nto work in sawmills because of the exemption contained in FLSA § 13(c)(7),\nare found to have operated or assisted in the operation of, power-driven\nwoodworking machines.</p><p>(8)  Guards.  The fact that a machine is guarded has no\neffect on the application of HO 5.  Woodworking machines are the most difficult\nto guard and guards alone cannot be relied upon to protect minors from the\nhazards of woodworking machines. </p><p>(b)  \n<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the\noccupation of operating power-driven woodworking machines, including\nsupervising or controlling the operation of such machines, feeding material\ninto such machines, and helping the operator to feed material into such\nmachines.</p><p>a.    \nThe occupations of operating\nwoodworking machines includes starting and stopping the machine, adjusting for\nthe type of work being performed, and placing the wood stock on the machine. \nMachines may be automatic, hand fed or power-fed. </p><p>b.    \nHO 5 does not prohibit these\nminors from placing materials on a moving chain or in a hopper or slide for\nautomatic feeding.</p><p>(2)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the\noccupation of setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning\npower-driven woodworking machines.</p><p>(3)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the\noccupation of off-bearing (unloading materials) from circular saws when the\nmaterial is not conveyed away from the machine by some mechanical means.</p><p>(4)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the\noccupation of off-bearing (unloading materials) from guillotine-action veneer\nclippers when the material is not conveyed away from the point of operation by\na moving belt or gravity chain.</p><p>(5)  The following is a partial list of power-driven\nwoodworking machines prohibited by HO 5. This equipment may be stationary or\nportable and may be powered by batteries:</p><p>a.     Band saws.</p><p>b.     Circular saws (table saws, swing\nsaws, portable saws,

initiated because of the\ngenerally accepted belief that such equipment presented a high degree of\naccident risk and was inappropriate for young workers.  Accidents have involved\nimproper rigging where loads have fallen on people and crushed them; persons\nfalling from stacked materials or down elevator shafts; and people coming into\ncontact with over-head electrical conductors.  These injuries not only occurred\nduring the operation of the equipment, but also while assisting in the\noperation of hoisting apparatus.   (2)          \nHO 7 originally prohibited 16- and\n17-year-olds from operating (or, in some cases assisting to operate) all\npower-driven hoisting apparatus which consist of elevators, cranes, derricks,\nhoists and high-lift trucks and portable elevators, and

direction.  This term\nincludes both passenger and freight elevators (including portable elevators or\ntiering machines), but shall not include dumbwaiters. b.             \nThe term automatic elevator shall\nmean a passenger elevator, a freight elevator, or a combination\npassenger-freight elevator, the operation of which is controlled by pushbuttons\nin such a manner that the starting, going to the landing selected, leveling and\nholding, and the opening and closing of the car and hoistway doors are entirely\nautomatic. c.             \nThe term automatic signal\noperation elevator shall mean an elevator which is started in response to the\noperation of a switch (such as a lever or pushbutton) in the car which when\noperated by the operator actuates a starting device that automatically closes\nthe car and hoistway doors—from this point on, the movement of the car to the\nlanding selected, leveling and holding when it gets there, and the opening of\nthe car and hoistway doors are entirely automatic. d.             \nThe term crane shall mean a\npower-driven machine for lifting and lowering a load and moving it\nhorizontally, in which the hoisting mechanism is an integral part of the\nmachine.  This term includes all types of cranes, such as cantilever gantry,\ncrawler, gantry, hammerhead, ingot pouring, jib, locomotive, motor-truck,\noverhead traveling, pillar jib, pintle, portal, semi-gantry, semi-portal,\nstorage bridge, tower, walking jib, and wall cranes. e.             \nThe term derrick shall mean a\npower-driven apparatus consisting of a mast or equivalent members held at the\ntop by guys or braces, with or without a boom, for use with a hoisting\nmechanism or operating ropes.  This term includes all types of derricks, such\nas A-frame, breast, Chicago boom, gin-pole, guy and stiff-leg derrick. f.              \nThe term hoist shall mean a\npower-driven apparatus for raising or lowering a load by the application of a\npulling force that does not include a car or platform running in guides.  This\nterm includes all types of hoists, such as base mounted electric, clevis\nsuspension, hook suspension, monorail, overhead electric, simple drum and\ntrolley suspension hoists. g.             \nThe term high-lift truck shall\nmean a power-driven industrial type of truck used for lateral transportation\nthat is equipped with a power-operated lifting device usually in the form of a\nfork or platform capable of tiering loaded pallets or skids one above the\nother.  Instead of a fork or a platform, the lifting device may consist of a\nram, scoop, shovel, crane, revolving fork, or other attachments for handling\nspecific loads.  The term shall mean and include highlift trucks known under\nsuch names as fork lifts, fork trucks, fork lift trucks, tiering trucks,\nbackhoes, front-end loaders, skid loaders, skid-steer loaders, Bobcat loaders,\nor stacking trucks, but shall not mean low-lift trucks or low-lift platform\ntrucks that are designed for the transportation of but not the tiering of\nmaterials. h.             \nThe term manlift shall mean a\ndevice intended for the conveyance of persons that consists of platforms or\nbrackets mounted on, or attached to, an endless belt, cable, chain or similar\nmethod of suspension; with such belt, cable or chain operating in a\nsubstantially vertical direction and being supported by and driven through\npulleys, sheaves or sprockets at the top and bottom.  The term shall also\ninclude truck- or equipment-mounted aerial platforms commonly referred to as\nscissor lifts, boom-type mobile elevating work platforms, work assist vehicles,\ncherry pickers, basket hoists, and bucket trucks. i.              \nThe term regular operator shall\nmean a person whose regular and practical duty is the operation of the\nelevator.   j.              \nThe term assigned operator shall\nmean a person who has been specifically designated to operate the elevator. \nSuch a person may be a “regular” operator.  Assigned operator may also mean a\nperson who is designated to operate the elevator in addition to his/her regular\njob.  More than one person may be assigned to operate the same elevator. (b)           \nOccupations PROHIBITED (1)          \nWork of operating, tending, riding\nupon, working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling an elevator, crane,\nderrick, hoist, or high-lift truck, except 16- and 17-year-olds may operate or\nride inside an unattended automatic operation passenger elevator. Tending such\nequipment includes assisting in the hoisting tasks being performed by the\nequipment. (2)          \nWork of operating, tending, riding\nupon, working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a manlift or freight\nelevator, except 16- and 17-year-olds may ride upon a freight elevator operated\nby an assigned operator.  Tending such equipment includes assisting in the\nhoisting tasks being performed by the equipment.  CL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and\n15-year-olds from operating most power-driven equipment, including “automatic”\nfreight elevators and automatic combination passenger/freight elevators.  Such\nyouth may operate and ride in fully automatic passenger elevators as found in\nmost office buildings. (3)          \nOperator of a portable elevator or\ntiering machine. (4)          \nOperator of a crane or derrick. (5)          \nTending, riding upon, working\nfrom, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a crane or derrick, including such\nwork as performed by crane hookers, crane chasers, hookers-on, riggers, rigger\nhelpers, and the like.   a.             \nTending such equipment includes\nassisting in the hoisting tasks being performed by the equipment.   b.             \nMembers of an oil-well drilling\ncrew are considered as assisting in the operation of such equipment (see\nFOH 33h07(e)(4)).   (6)          \nOperating, tending, riding upon,\nworking from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a hoist—including hoists\nthat do not exceed one-ton capacity.   a.             \nPrior to July 19, 2010, 16- and\n17-year-olds were permitted to operate certain electric or air-operated hoists\nthat did not exceed a one ton capacity (see 75 FR 28433).   b.             \nThis prohibition includes hoists\ncommonly used on tow trucks.   HO 2 prohibits minors from operating a motor\nvehicle while towing another vehicle. (7)          \nOperating, tending riding upon,\nworking from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a high-lift truck such as\na forklift, fork truck, fork-lift truck, tiering truck, backhoe, front end\nloader, skid loader, skid-steer loader, stacking truck and a Bobcat loader.   a.             \nPrior to July 19, 2010, HO 7 only prohibited\nthe work of operating a high-lift truck.  The 2010 Final Rule added the tasks\nof tending, riding upon, working from, repairing, servicing, and disassembling\nsuch equipment. b.             \n“Tending” includes assisting in\nthe hoisting tasks being performed by the equipment.  Minors under 18 years of\nage may not be employed as “spotters” of forklifts—workers who provide signals\nor cues to forklift operators to assist in the safe operation of forklifts—as\nsuch work is “tending” (see 75 FR 28434). c.             \nThe prohibitions of HO 7 apply\neven if the minors operating such equipment do not use or activate the\nequipment’s hoisting apparatus.   1.             \nFor example, in Lynnville\nTransport, Inc. v. Chao, 316 F. Supp.2d 790 (S.D. Iowa 2004), the District\nCourt affirmed DOL’s position that minors who operated a skid loader as a\n“scraper” to muck-out a cattle transport vehicle were still employed in\nviolation of HO 7 even though they never raised or lowered the shovel (the\nhoisting apparatus) of the equipment.  The court cited the administrative law\njudge’s reasoning that “although the minors testified that they did not lift\nthe shovel of the skid loader to high levels in performing their duties, the\nfact that they had the opportunity to do so, either intentionally or\nunintentionally, by moving the levers, placed the minors and other minors in\nthe area in a potentially hazardous position.” (316 F.Supp.2nd at 800).   2.             \nThis same reasoning would prohibit\nminors from simply moving such power-driven hoisting equipment from one\nlocation to another, such as around a job site or from the back of an equipment\ndealer showroom to the front of the showroom. (8)          \nWork of operating, tending, riding\nupon, working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a manlift.  The\ndefinition of a manlift includes, since July 19, 2010, truck- or\nequipment-mounted aerial platforms commonly referred to as scissor lifts,\nboom-type mobile elevating work platforms, work assist vehicles, cherry\npickers, basket hoists, and bucket trucks. (9)          \nOperating, tending, riding upon,\nworking from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a freight elevator, except\n16- and 17-year-olds may ride on a freight elevator when the elevator is\noperated by an assigned operator. (c)           \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED (1)          \nAutomotive and truck servicing\nestablishments a.             \n“Grease rack” lifts used in\ngasoline service stations, tire stores and other establishments servicing\nautomobiles are not “power-driven hoisting apparatus” covered by HO 7. b.             \nService jacks, hand jacks, air\ncompressors, tire changers, truck tire changers, and wheel balancers are all\noutside the scope of HO 7. (2)          \nOperation of amusement park rides a.             \nThe operation of amusement park\nrides is not prohibited by HO 7. b.             \nAlthough a number of rides in\namusement and theme parks have characteristics similar to certain machines that\nminors under 18 years of age are prohibited from operating under HO 7, a\ncareful review of these rides, which have a variety of names, has concluded\nthat none of the machines are “derricks”, “cranes”,\n“hoists”, “elevators” or “manlifts” within the meaning of the HO. 1.             \nSwing-type rides appear very\nsimilar to a stiff-leg derrick or various types of cranes including a jib\ncrane.  However, these rides only swing or rotate and lack any hoisting\napparatus. 2.             \nA number of roller coasters and\nsimilar rides are connected cars operated on a rail and driven by a chain\npull.  They are not operated by hoists, nor are they considered elevators or\nmanlifts.  3.             \nWater rides often follow the flow\nof the water down a trough and are repositioned at a higher level by a conveyor\nbelt.  Since the boats carrying the riders remain within the trough, these\nrides are not considered elevators or manlifts. (3)          \nOperation of motorized hand\ntrucks.  Motorized hand trucks, such as the Yale Low Lift Pallet-Walkie\nMotorized Hand Truck, models MPW 040 and 060, are not considered to be\n“high-lift trucks.”  Designed for transportation but not the tiering of\nmaterials, they are low-lift trucks and not subject to HO 7.  (4)          \nHanglines in poultry processing\nplants and dry cleaners are considered to be “chain conveyors” and are not\ncovered by HO 7.  These apparatus do not have hoists to raise and lower the\nloads. a.             \nHanglines in poultry processing\nplants are usually made up of a metal I-beam, a continuous chain, and shackles\nattached to the chain.  The chain may be powered by an electric motor or other\nmeans and generally runs from the loading dock or platform, through the plant\nwere the poultry is processed and back to the loading dock in a continuous\nloop.  Crews on the platform (or sometimes in a darkened room nearby) attach\nthe live poultry to the shackles by their feet where they hang upside down. \nThe hangline then moves to the killing area within the plant and may in the\ncourse of its route rise or descend within the plant to different levels.  The\nspeed of the chain is coordinated with the loading crew’s ability to hang a\nfowl on each shackle and not leave any without a bird on it. HO 11, as of July\n19, 2010, prohibits the employment of youth under 18 in most occupations in or\nabout poultry slaughtering and processing establishments. b.             \nHanglines in dry cleaners that\nhold finished garments to be picked up operate in a similar manner as the\nhanglines in poultry processing plants. (5)          \n“Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART”   a.             \nThe “Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART”\nare two types of machines often used by grocers and other retail stores to move\nlarge strings of shopping carts.  These machines are hooked to the last\nshopping cart in a string and then the operator guides the string of carts back\nto the store while commanding the machine to move by means of a hand-held\nremote control.  The operator walks behind the machine and operates the manual\nthrottle when returning to the parking lot to collect more carts.   b.             \nThese machines do not fall within\nthe definitions of any of the hoists prohibited by HO 7; nor are these machines\nconsidered to be “motor vehicles” as defined in HO 2.  Sixteen- and 17-year-old\nminors are permitted to operate these machines. c.             \nSince the “Cart Caddy” and\n“QuicKART” are both power-driven machines, 29 CFR 570.33(b) would prohibit\n14- and 15-year-olds from operating or tending such machines (see\nFOH 33c06(e)(5)).   (d)           \nExemptions (1)          \nThere is no provision in HO 7 for\napprentices or student-learners. (2)          \nSixteen- and 17-year-olds may\noperate an automatic elevator and an automatic signal operation elevator\nprovided that all the following conditions have been met: a.             \nThe exposed portion of the car\ninterior, the car door, and the hoistway doors are constructed of solid\nsurfaces without any opening through which a part of the body may extend, b.             \nAll hoistway openings at floor\nlevel have doors which are interlocked with the car door so as to prevent the\ncar from starting until all such doors are closed and locked, c.             \nThe elevator is equipped with a\ndevice which will stop and hold the car in case of overspeed or if the cable\nslackens or breaks, and d.             \nThe elevator is equipped with\nupper and lower travel limit devices which will normally bring the car to rest\nat either terminal and a final limit switch which will prevent the movement in\neither direction and will open in case of excessive over travel by the car. (e)           \nEnforcement positions (1)          \nChair-lifts at ski resorts Chair-lifts\nat ski resorts which operate in a substantially vertical direction – where the\nlifts travel in a vertical direction that is greater than the horizontal\ndistance traveled – are manlifts subject to HO 7 and may not be operated by\nminors under 18 years of age. Those chair-lifts which travel a greater distance\nhorizontally than vertically are outside the scope of HO 7. (2)          \nAirport baggage handling equipment a.             \nA conveyor belt loader is a\nwheeled vehicle, equipped with a movable conveyor belt, used to load and unload\nindividual baggage items from the cargo hold of aircraft.  The front end of the\nconveyor is raised and lowered by a hydraulic piston located under the conveyor\nbelt.  The operation of the conveyor belt loader is not prohibited by HO 7. b.             \nA canister loader truck is a\nwheeled vehicle with a lifting device which moves baggage between the terminal\nand the aircraft.  Baggage is placed in canisters which hold 50 to 70 bags and\nsuitcases.  The canisters are then pushed onto the bed of the loader which is\nequipped with rollers.  The canisters are rolled onto the loader and are rolled\noff onto the plane.  Most of the time this function is automated, however,\nsometimes hand loading and/or unloading of the canisters is required.  The load\nis raised and lowered by hydraulics to and from the ground level to the cargo\nhold of the airplane.  The reverse process takes place during the unloading of\nthe plane.  Canister loader trucks are high-lift trucks as defined in\n29 CFR 570.58(b) and therefore HO 7 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds\nfrom operating, loading and unloading such equipment.  (3)          \nPower winches WH\nhas opined since as early as 1961 that HO 7 prohibits minors under the age of\n18 from operating power winches, including those affixed to tow trucks or wrecker\ntrucks.  Although HO 7 does not specifically state that winches are covered,\nthe HO does state that the term “hoist” shall mean a power-driven apparatus for\nraising or lowering a load by the application of a pulling force that does not\ninclude a car or platform running in guides.  The definition further adds that\nthe term shall include all types of hoists. (4)          \nDrilling rig crews   Members\nof a well drilling crew are considered as assisting in the operation of hoists\nand therefore fall under the provisions of HO 7. (5)          \nAssisting in the operation of\npower-driven patient/resident hoists or lifts               a.             \nWHD issued a Final Rule on May 20,\n2010, which removed from HO 7 the exemption that allowed 16- and 17-year-olds\nto operate air or electric powered hoists that did not exceed a lift capacity\nof one ton (see 75 Fed. Reg. 28404, 28434 (May 20, 2010)). With\nthe elimination of that exemption, minors under the age of 18 were prohibited\nfrom operating or assisting in operating all power-driven hoists in any workplace,\nincluding power-driven hoists/lifts used to elevate and transport\npatients/residents in hospitals, nursing homes, and residences. \nProhibited equipment includes floor-based vertical powered patient/resident\nlift devices; ceiling-mounted vertical powered patient/resident lift devices;\nand powered sit-to-stand patient/resident lift devices. b.             \nOn July 13, 2011, WHD issued Field\nAssistance Bulletin (FAB) 2011-3 (Assisting in the operation of\npower-driven patient/resident hoists/lifts Under the Child Labor Provisions of\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act) which states that WH will not charge a child\nlabor violation when properly trained 16- and 17-year-olds, under specific\nconditions, assist a trained adult in the operation of power-driven\npatient/resident lifts/hoists.  The FAB is available at\nhttp://www.dol.gov/whd/FieldBulletins/index.htm.  c.             \nWH will exercise its enforcement discretion, and not assert\nchild labor violations involving 16- and 17-year-olds who assist a trained\nadult worker in the operation of floor-based vertical powered patient/resident\nlift devices, ceiling-mounted vertical powered patient/resident lift devices,\nand powered sit-to-stand patient/resident lift devices only when all of the\nfollowing conditions are met:  1.             \nThe child (16- or 17-year-old) has\nsuccessfully completed the 75 clock hours of nurses aide training required by\nthe Federal Nursing Home Reform Act from the\nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, as outlined in 42 CFR\n§ 483.152, or a higher state standard where applicable, and has\nsuccessfully completed the nurses aide competency evaluation detailed in 42\nCFR 483.154, or a higher state standard where applicable.  WHD will not\nassert a violation of HO 7 when 16- and 17-year-olds engage in the limited\noperation of patient lifts as required by this nursing aide training. 2.             \nThe child is not operating by\nhimself or herself floor-based vertical powered patient/resident lift devices,\nceiling-mounted vertical powered patient/resident lift devices, and powered\nsit-to-stand patient/resident lift devices and the child is assisting in the\nuse of lifting devices as a junior member of at least a two-person team that is\nheaded by an employee who is at least 18 years of age.  All members of the team\nmust be trained in the safe operation of the lifting devices being used.        3.             \nAs a junior member of the team, the child may set up, move, position,\nand secure unoccupied lifting devices.  The child may assist trained adult\nemployees in attaching slings to and un-attaching slings from lifting devices\nprior to and after the lift/transfer of the patient/resident is\ncompleted.  The child may also assist trained adult employees in operating\nthe controls that activate the power to lift/transfer the patient/resident. \nThe child may act as a spotter/observer and may position items such as a chair,\nwheelchair, bed, and commode under the patient/resident who is being\nlifted/transferred. 4.             \nAs a junior member of\nthe team, the child may not independently engage in “hands on” physical contact\nwith the patient/resident during the lifting/transferring process (such as\nplacing or removing the sling, including pushing or pulling the sling\nunder/around the patient/resident; adjusting the sling under/around the\npatient/resident; and manipulating the patient/resident when placing, adjusting\nor removing a sling under/around the patient/resident), and may only assist in\nthese “hands on” activities when assisting a trained adult employee while the\nadult employee is simultaneously engaged in such activities.  The child may\nsimilarly assist a trained adult employee who is manipulating, guiding,\nrotating, or otherwise maneuvering the patient while the patient is being\nlifted/transferred.  In addition, the child may similarly assist a trained\nadult employee who is pushing, pulling or rotating lifting devices when the\ndevice is engaged in the process of lifting/transferring a patient/resident. 5.             \nThe child is not injured while\noperating or assisting in the operation of a lifting device. 6.             \nThe employer has provided to each\n16- and 17-year-old who will assist in the operation of lifting devices a copy\nof the document that was forwarded with this Field Assistance Bulletin as\nAttachment A.  Attachment A advised the young worker of what tasks he or she\nmay and may not perform while assisting in the operation of a power-driven\npatient/resident lift/hoist. d.             \nThe above enforcement position\nwill not apply when WH determines that a 16- or 17-year-old employee has\nassisted in the operation of a power-driven patient/resident lifting device and\nthe requirements discussed in paragraphs 1 through 6 above have not been\nmet.  In such instances, WH will charge appropriate child labor violations\nand the employer will be subject to the assessment of child labor civil money\npenalties as permitted by FLSA section 16(e)(1).  e.             \nAs noted in paragraph 5 above,\nthis enforcement policy is also not applicable if a child is injured while\noperating or assisting in the operation of power-driven patient hoists/lifts. \nIf a child is injured while engaged in such activities, even if the child was\nemployed in compliance with this nonenforcement policy, WH will generally\ncharge a violation of HO 7 and assess a civil money penalty.  Notwithstanding\nthis enforcement policy, WHD will investigate reports of children being injured\nwhile assisting in the operation of power-driven patient hoists/lifts, as well\nas complaints that the employer has not complied with the requirements in\nparagraphs 1 through 6 above.","html":"<p>Name: \nOccupations Involved in the Operation of Power-driven Hoisting Apparatus</p><p>Originally\nAdopted:  July 16, 1946</p><p>(a)           \nScope of HO 7</p><p>(1)          \nThe investigation of occupations\ninvolved in the operation of hoisting apparatus was initiated because of the\ngenerally accepted belief that such equipment presented a high degree of\naccident risk and was inappropriate for young workers.  Accidents have involved\nimproper rigging where loads have fallen on people and crushed them;

Tending such\nequipment includes assisting in the hoisting tasks being performed by the\nequipment.</p><p>(2)          \nWork of operating, tending, riding\nupon, working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a manlift or freight\nelevator, except 16- and 17-year-olds may ride upon a freight elevator operated\nby an assigned operator.  Tending such equipment includes assisting in the\nhoisting tasks being performed by the equipment.  CL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and\n15-year-olds from operating most power-driven equipment, including “automatic”\nfreight elevators and automatic combination passenger/freight elevators.  Such\nyouth may operate and ride in fully automatic passenger elevators as found in\nmost office buildings.</p><p>(3)          \nOperator of a portable elevator or\ntiering machine.</p><p>(4)          \nOperator of a crane or derrick.</p><p>(5)          \nTending, riding upon, working\nfrom, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a crane or derrick, including such\nwork as performed by crane hookers, crane chasers, hookers-on, riggers, rigger\nhelpers, and the like.  </p><p>a.             \nTending such equipment includes\nassisting in the hoisting tasks being performed by the equipment.  </p><p>b.             \nMembers of an oil-well drilling\ncrew are considered as assisting in the operation of such equipment (see\nFOH 33h07(e)(4)).  </p><p>(6)          \nOperating, tending, riding upon,\nworking from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a hoist—including hoists\nthat do not exceed one-ton capacity.  </p><p>a.             \nPrior to July 19, 2010, 16- and\n17-year-olds were permitted to operate certain electric or air-operated hoists\nthat did not exceed a one ton capacity (see 75 FR 28433).  </p><p>b.             \nThis prohibition includes hoists\ncommonly used on tow trucks.   HO 2 prohibits minors from operating a motor\nvehicle while towing another vehicle.</p><p>(7)          \nOperating, tending riding upon,\nworking from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a high-lift truck such as\na forklift, fork truck, fork-lift truck, tiering truck, backhoe, front end\nloader, skid loader, skid-steer loader, stacking truck and a Bobcat loader.  </p><p>a.             \nPrior to July 19, 2010, HO 7 only prohibited\nthe work of operating a high-lift truck.  The 2010 Final Rule added the tasks\nof tending, riding upon, working from, repairing, servicing, and disassembling\nsuch equipment.</p><p>b.             \n“Tending” includes assisting in\nthe hoisting tasks being performed by the equipment.  Minors under 18 years of\nage may not be employed as “spotters” of forklifts—workers who provide signals\nor cues to forklift operators to assist in the safe operation of forklifts—as\nsuch work is “tending” (see 75 FR 28434).</p><p>c.             \nThe prohibitions of HO 7 apply\neven if the minors operating such equipment do not use or activate the\nequipment’s hoisting apparatus.  </p><p>1.             \nFor example, in Lynnville\nTransport, Inc. v. Chao, 316 F. Supp.2d 790 (S.D. Iowa 2004), the District\nCourt affirmed DOL’s position that minors who operated a skid loader as a\n“scraper” to muck-out a cattle transport vehicle were still employed in\nviolation of HO 7 even though they never raised or lowered the shovel (the\nhoisting apparatus) of the equipment.  The court cited the administrative law\njudge’s reasoning that “although the minors testified that they did not lift\nthe shovel of the skid loader to high levels in performing their duties, the\nfact that they had the opportunity to do so, either intentionally or\nunintentionally, by moving the levers, placed the minors and other minors in\nthe area in a potentially hazardous position.” (316 F.Supp.2nd at 800).  </p><p>2.             \nThis same reasoning would prohibit\nminors from simply moving such power-driven hoisting equipment from one\nlocation to another, such as around a job site or from the back of an equipment\ndealer showroom to the front of the showroom.</p><p>(8)          \nWork of operating, tending, riding\nupon, working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a manlift.  The\ndefinition of a manlift includes, since July 19, 2010, truck- or\nequipment-mounted aerial platforms commonly referred to as scissor lifts,\nboom-type mobile elevating work platforms, work assist vehicles, cherry\npickers, basket hoists, and bucket trucks.</p><p>(9)          \nOperating, tending, riding upon,\nworking from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a freight elevator, except\n16- and 17-year-olds may ride on a freight elevator when the elevator is\noperated by an assigned operator.</p><p>(c)           \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED</p><p>(1)          \nAutomotive and truck servicing\nestablishments</p><p>a.             \n“Grease rack” lifts used in\ngasoline service stations, tire stores and other establishments servicing\nautomobiles are not “power-driven hoisting apparatus” covered by HO 7.</p><p>b.             \nService jacks, hand jacks, air\ncompressors, tire changers, truck tire changers, and wheel balancers are all\noutside the scope of HO 7.</p><p>(2)          \nOperation of amusement park rides</p><p>a.             \nThe operation of amusement park\nrides is not prohibited by HO 7.</p><p>b.             \nAlthough a number of rides in\namusement and theme parks have characteristics similar to certain machines that\nminors under 18 years of age are prohibited from operating under HO 7, a\ncareful review of these rides, which have a variety of names, has concluded\nthat none of the machines are “derricks<a name=\"OLE_LINK5\">”</a>, “cranes”,\n“hoists”, “elevators” or “manlifts” within the meaning of the HO.</p><p>1.             \nSwing-type rides appear very\nsimilar to a stiff-leg derrick or various types of cranes including a jib\ncrane.  However, these rides only swing or rotate and lack any hoisting\napparatus.</p><p>2.             \nA number of roller coasters and\nsimilar rides are connected cars operated on a rail and driven by a chain\npull.  They are not operated by hoists, nor are they considered elevators or\nmanlifts. </p><p>3.             \nWater rides often follow the flow\nof the water down a trough and are repositioned at a higher level by a conveyor\nbelt.  Since the boats carrying the riders remain within the trough, these\nrides are not considered elevators or manlifts.</p><p>(3)          \nOperation of motorized hand\ntrucks.  Motorized hand trucks, such as the Yale Low Lift Pallet-Walkie\nMotorized Hand Truck, models MPW 040 and 060, are not considered to be\n“high-lift trucks.”  Designed for transportation but not the tiering of\nmaterials, they are low-lift trucks and not subject to HO 7. </p><p>(4)          \nHanglines in poultry processing\nplants and dry cleaners are considered to be “chain conveyors” and are not\ncovered by HO 7.  These apparatus do not have hoists to raise and lower the\nloads.</p><p>a.             \nHanglines in poultry processing\nplants are usually made up of a metal I-beam, a continuous chain, and shackles\nattached to the chain.  The chain may be powered by an electric motor or other\nmeans and generally runs from the loading dock or platform, through the plant\nwere the poultry is processed and back to the loading dock in a continuous\nloop.  Crews on the platform (or sometimes in a darkened room nearby) attach\nthe live poultry to the shackles by their feet where they hang upside down. \nThe hangline then moves to the killing area within the plant and may in the\ncourse of its route rise or descend within the plant to different levels.  The\nspeed of the chain is coordinated with the loading crew’s ability to hang a\nfowl on each shackle and not leave any without a bird on it. HO 11, as of July\n19, 2010, prohibits the employment of youth under 18 in most occupations in or\nabout poultry slaughtering and processing establishments.</p><p>b.             \nHanglines in dry cleaners that\nhold finished garments to be picked up operate in a similar manner as the\nhanglines in poultry processing plants.</p><p>(5)          \n“Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART”  </p><p>a.             \nThe “Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART”\nare two types of machines often used by grocers and other retail stores to move\nlarge strings of shopping carts.  These machines are hooked to the last\nshopping cart in a string and then the operator guides the string of carts back\nto the store while commanding the machine to move by means of a hand-held\nremote control.  The operator walks behind the machine and operates the manual\nthrottle when returning to the parking lot to collect more carts.  </p><p>b.             \nThese machines do not fall within\nthe definitions of any of the hoists prohibited by HO 7; nor are these machines\nconsidered to be “motor vehicles” as defined in HO 2.  Sixteen- and 17-year-old\nminors are permitted to operate these machines.</p><p>c.             \nSince the “Cart Caddy” and\n“QuicKART” are both power-driven machines, 29 CFR 570.33(b) would prohibit\n14- and 15-year-olds from operating or tending such machines (see\nFOH 33c06(e)(5)).  </p><p>(d)           \nExemptions</p><p>(1)          \nThere is no provision in HO 7 for\napprentices or student-learners.</p><p>(2)          \nSixteen- and 17-year-olds may\noperate an automatic elevator and an automatic signal operation elevator\nprovided that all the following conditions have been met:</p><p>a.             \nThe exposed portion of the car\ninterior, the car door, and the hoistway doors are constructed of solid\nsurfaces without any opening through which a part of the body may extend,</p><p>b.             \nAll hoistway openings at floor\nlevel have doors which are interlocked with the car door so as to prevent the\ncar from starting until all such doors are closed and locked,</p><p>c.             \nThe elevator is equipped with a\ndevice which will stop and hold the car in case of overspeed or if the cable\nslackens or breaks, and</p><p>d.             \nThe elevator is equipped with\nupper and lower travel limit devices which will normally bring the car to rest\nat either terminal and a final limit switch which will prevent the movement in\neither direction and will open in case of excessive over travel by the car.</p><p>(e)           \nEnforcement positions</p><p>(1)          \nChair-lifts at ski resorts</p><p>Chair-lifts\nat ski resorts which operate in a substantially vertical direction – where the\nlifts travel in a vertical direction that is greater than the horizontal\ndistance traveled – are manlifts subject to HO 7 and may not be operated by\nminors under 18 years of age. Those chair-lifts which travel a greater distance\nhorizontally than vertically are outside the scope of HO 7.</p><p>(2)          \nAirport baggage handling equipment</p><p>a.             \nA conveyor belt loader is a\nwheeled vehicle, equipped with a movable conveyor belt, used to load and unload\nindividual baggage items from the cargo hold of aircraft.  The front end of the\nconveyor is raised and lowered by a hydraulic piston located under the conveyor\nbelt.  The operation of the conveyor belt loader is not prohibited by HO 7.</p><p>b.             \nA canister loader truck is a\nwheeled vehicle with a lifting device which moves baggage between the terminal\nand the aircraft.  Baggage is placed in canisters which hold 50 to 70 bags and\nsuitcases.  The canisters are then pushed onto the bed of the loader which is\nequipped with rollers.  The canisters are rolled onto the loader and are rolled\noff onto the plane.  Most of the time this function is automated, however,\nsometimes hand loading and/or unloading of the canisters is required.  The load\nis raised and lowered by hydraulics to and from the ground level to the cargo\nhold of the airplane.  The reverse process takes place during the unloading of\nthe plane.  Canister loader trucks are high-lift trucks as defined in\n29 CFR 570.58(b) and therefore HO 7 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds\nfrom operating, loading and unloading such equipment. </p><p>(3)          \nPower winches</p><p>WH\nhas opined since as early as 1961 that HO 7 prohibits minors under the age of\n18 from operating power winches, including those affixed to tow trucks or wrecker\ntrucks.  Although HO 7 does not specifically state that winches are covered,\nthe HO does state that the term “hoist” shall mean a power-driven apparatus for\nraising or lowering a load by the application of a pulling force that does not\ninclude a car or platform running in guides.  The definition further adds that\nthe term shall include all types of hoists.</p><p>(4)          \nDrilling rig crews  </p><p>Members\nof a well drilling crew are considered as assisting in the operation of hoists\nand therefore fall under the provisions of HO 7.</p><p>(5)          \nAssisting in the operation of\npower-driven patient/resident hoists or lifts              </p><p>a.             \nWHD issued a Final Rule on May 20,\n2010, which removed from HO 7 the exemption that allowed 16- and 17-year-olds\nto operate air or electric powered hoists that did not exceed a lift capacity\nof one ton (see 75 Fed. Reg. 28404, 28434 (May 20, 2010)). With\nthe elimination of that exemption, minors under the age of 18 were prohibited\nfrom operating or assisting in operating all power-driven hoists in any workplace,\nincluding power-driven hoists/lifts used to elevate and transport\npatients/residents in hospitals, nursing homes, and residences. \nProhibited equipment includes floor-based vertical powered patient/resident\nlift devices; ceiling-mounted vertical powered patient/resident lift devices;\nand powered sit-to-stand patient/resident lift devices.</p><p>b.             \nOn July 13, 2011, WHD issued Field\nAssistance Bulletin (FAB) 2011-3 (Assisting in the operation of\npower-driven patient/resident hoists/lifts Under the Child Labor Provisions of\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act) which states that WH will not charge a child\nlabor violation when properly trained 16- and 17-year-olds, under specific\nconditions, assist a trained adult in the operation of power-driven\npatient/resident lifts/hoists.  The FAB is available at\nhttp://www.dol.gov/whd/FieldBulletins/index.htm. </p><p>c.             \nWH will exercise its enforcement discretion, and not assert\nchild labor violations involving 16- and 17-year-olds who assist a trained\nadult worker in the operation of floor-based vertical powered patient/resident\nlift devices, ceiling-mounted vertical powered patient/resident lift devices,\nand powered sit-to-stand patient/resident lift devices only when all of the\nfollowing conditions are met: </p><p>1.             \nThe child (16- or 17-year-old) has\nsuccessfully completed the 75 clock hours of nurses aide training required by\nthe Federal Nursing Home Reform Act from the\nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, as outlined in 42 CFR\n§ 483.152, or a higher state standard where applicable, and has\nsuccessfully completed the nurses aide competency evaluation detailed in 42\nCFR 483.154, or a higher state standard where applicable.  WHD will not\nassert a violation of HO 7 when 16- and 17-year-olds engage in the limited\noperation of patient lifts as required by this nursing aide training.</p><p>2.             \nThe child is not operating by\nhimself or herself floor-based vertical powered patient/resident lift devices,\nceiling-mounted vertical powered patient/resident lift devices, and powered\nsit-to-stand patient/resident lift devices and the child is assisting in the\nuse of lifting devices as a junior member of at least a two-person team that is\nheaded by an employee who is at least 18 years of age.  All members of the team\nmust be trained in the safe operation of the lifting devices being used.       </p><p>3.             \nAs a junior member of the team, the child may set up, move, position,\nand secure unoccupied lifting devices.  The child may assist trained adult\nemployees in attaching slings to and un-attaching slings from lifting devices\nprior to and after the lift/transfer of the patient/resident is\ncompleted.  The child may also assist trained adult employees in operating\nthe controls that activate the power to lift/transfer the patient/resident. \nThe child may act as a spotter/observer and may position items such as a chair,\nwheelchair, bed, and commode under the patient/resident who is being\nlifted/transferred.</p><p>4.             \nAs a junior member of\nthe team, the child may not independently engage in “hands on” physical contact\nwith the patient/resident during the lifting/transferring process (such as\nplacing or removing the sling, including pushing or pulling the sling\nunder/around the patient/resident; adjusting the sling under/around the\npatient/resident; and manipulating the patient/resident when placing, adjusting\nor removing a sling under/around the patient/resident), and may only assist in\nthese “hands on” activities when assisting a trained adult employee while the\nadult employee is simultaneously engaged in such activities.  The child may\nsimilarly assist a trained adult employee who is manipulating, guiding,\nrotating, or otherwise maneuvering the patient while the patient is being\nlifted/transferred.  In addition, the child may similarly assist a trained\nadult employee who is pushing, pulling or rotating lifting devices when the\ndevice is engaged in the process of lifting/transferring a patient/resident.</p><p>5.             \nThe child is not injured while\noperating or assisting in the operation of a lifting device.</p><p>6.             \nThe employer has provided to each\n16- and 17-year-old who will assist in the operation of lifting devices a copy\nof the document that was forwarded with this Field Assistance Bulletin as\nAttachment A.  Attachment A advised the young worker of what tasks he or she\nmay and may not perform while assisting in the operation of a power-driven\npatient/resident lift/hoist.</p><p>d.             \nThe above enforcement position\nwill not apply when WH determines that a 16- or 17-year-old employee has\nassisted in the operation of a power-driven patient/resident lifting device and\nthe requirements discussed in paragraphs 1 through 6 above have not been\nmet.  In such instances, WH will charge appropriate child labor violations\nand the employer will be subject to the assessment of child labor civil money\npenalties as permitted by FLSA section 16(e)(1). </p><p>e.             \nAs noted in paragraph 5 above,\nthis enforcement policy is also not applicable if a child is injured while\noperating or assisting in the operation of power-driven patient hoists/lifts. \nIf a child is injured while engaged in such activities, even if the child was\nemployed in compliance with this nonenforcement policy, WH will generally\ncharge a violation of HO 7 and assess a civil money penalty.  Notwithstanding\nthis enforcement policy, WHD will investigate reports of children being injured\nwhile assisting in the operation of power-driven patient hoists/lifts, as well\nas complaints that the employer has not complied with the requirements in\nparagraphs 1 through 6 above.</p>"},{"section":"33h08","chapter":"33","section_title":"33h08.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 8—Power-Driven Metal Forming, Punching,\nand Shearing Machine Occupations.","text":"Name:  Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven metal\nforming, punching, and shearing machines. Originally Adopted:  October 30, 1950 (a)  \nScope of HO 8 (1)  The report establishing HO 8 concluded that\nmetal-forming, punching and shearing machines are dangerous because they\nutilize a heavy crushing or powerful cutting action to perform their work, and\nbecause the operator is required in many cases to place his or her hands close\nto the point of operation in feeding them.  Even with guards and better feeding\nmethods, the report continued, these machines are extremely dangerous.  In\nlight of the preceding and the fact that state child labor laws varied greatly\nand did not reflect “an awareness of the hazards of operating” these machines,\nthe report recommended the establishment of HO 8.  (2)  HO 8 is machine specific and it prohibits the\noperation, helping to operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or\ncleaning power-driven metal forming, punching, and shearing machines.  The\nscope of this HO is narrow and does not include a very large group of metal\nworking machines known as machine tools.  (3)  Definitions a.    \nThe term operator shall mean a\nperson who operates a machine covered by this HO by performing such functions\nas starting or stopping the machine, placing materials into or removing them\nfrom the machine, or any other functions directly involved in operation of the\nmachine.  b.    \nThe term helper shall mean a\nperson who assists in the operation of a machine covered by this HO by helping\nplace materials into or removing them from the machine. c.    \nThe term forming, punching, and\nshearing machines shall mean power-driven metal-working machines, other than\nmachine tools, which change the shape of or cut metal by means of tools, such\nas dies, rolls, or knives which are mounted on rams, plungers, or other moving\nparts. d.    \nA rolling machine is a machine\nused to change the size or shape of metal by running it between rolls under\npressure. e.    \nThe term pressing or punching\nmachines shall mean any machine falling within one of the three following types\nof machines: 1.    \nA punch press is a machine fitted\nwith a ram or plunger and a die for the purpose of blanking, trimming, drawing,\npunching, or stamping metal. 2.    \nA power press is a large, slow\nacting press which performs an operation similar to a punch press, but is intended\nto handle very large or very heavy work. 3.    \nA plate punch is a machine for\npunching holes (such as for rivets) in heavy metal plate. A.   \nA bending machine is a machine for\nbending metal plate between a stationary bed and a moving ram (metal bending\nmachines are known as brakes).  B.   \nA hammering machine is a machine\nwhich employs a ram or plunger to pound the material being worked on into the\ndesired shape. C.   \nA shearing machine is a machine\nfor cutting metal by the shearing action of a movable blade or blades. D.   \nA guillotine shear is a machine\nused for cutting heavy metal plates which consists of a movable upper blade and\na stationary lower blade.  The upper blade comes down vertically to meet the\nlower stationary blade. E.   \nAn alligator shear is a machine\nused for cutting barstock which consists of a movable upper blade and a\nstationary lower blade operating like scissors. F.    \nA circular shear is a machine with\nrevolving disks which cut the material when it passes through the point where\nthe revolving disks meet.  It is used for cutting light metal sheets such as\nthose used in tin cans.   G.   \nMachine tools are power-driven\ncomplete metal-working machines having one or more tool-or work-holding\ndevices, and are used for progressively removing metal in the form of chips. \nThe following are the five principal types of machine tools classified by their\nfunction: i.     \nMilling machine tools consist of\nmachining a piece of metal by bringing it into contact with a rotating cutter\nwith multiple cutting edges.  ii.    \nPlaning machine tools consists of\nmachining a surface by moving the work back and forth under a stationary\ncutting tool.  iii.  \nTurning machine tools consists of\nshaping a rotating piece by means of a cutting tool to generate a cylindrical\nsurface.  iv.  \nBoring machine tools consists of\ncutting a round hole by means of a rotating cutting tool.  v.    \nGrinding machine tools consists of\nshaping a piece by bringing it into contact with a rotating abrasive wheel. (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED All occupations as an operator of, helper on, or in setting up,\nadjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning the following power-driven metal\nforming, punching, and shearing machines:   (1)  All rolling machines such as: beading, straightening,\ncorrugating, flanging, or bending rolls, and hot or cold rolling mills.  (2)  All pressing and punching machines (except as an\noperator or helper on a punch press with automatic feeding and ejection as\ndiscussed in FOH 33h08(c)(1) below) such as: punch press, blanking press,\nforming press, drawing press, stamping press, extrusion press, embossing press,\ncoining press, assembling press, bending press, power press, riveting press,\neyeletting machine, and plate punch.  (3)  All bending machines such as:  apron breaks and press\nbreaks.  (4)  All hammering machines such as:  drop hammer, helve\nhammer, board drop hammer, rope drop hammer, air drop hammer, steam drip\nhammer, power hammer, air hammer, and steam hammer.  (5)  All shearing machines such as:  guillotine shears,\nsquaring shears, alligator shears, and rotary shears.  (c)  \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED (1)  Occupations as an operator of or as helper on a punch\npress equipped with full automatic feed and ejection with a fixed barrier guard\nto prevent the hands or fingers of the operator from entering the area between\nthe dies, power presses, and plate punches.  (2)  HO 8 does not apply to the operation of machine\ntools.  The following is a list of machine tools classified by function: a.    \nMilling machines:  horizontal\nmilling machines, vertical milling machines, universal milling machines,\nplaner-type milling machines, gear cutting machines, profilers, routers, and\ncircular saws (Circular saws are subject to HO 14).  b.    \nPlaning machines:  planers,\nshapers, slotters,

exemptions applicable to this order. (e)  \nEnforcement positions (1)  The following is a list of power-driven machines that\nhave been determined to be covered by HO 8: a.    \nAutomatic Bulkan Assembler (the\nBulkan).  This power-driven machine performs a bending or crimping action on\nmetal and is covered by HO 8.  The machine attaches pre-formed metal edged\npaper disks to the top and bottom of cylindrical paper sidewalls.   b.    \nHager press.  This hydraulic\npress, designed to install a broad range of fasteners in flat or pre-formed\nsheet metal assemblies, is covered by HO 8.  c.    \nMetal bottom seamer . This\npower-driven machine performs a rolling and bending action on metal and is\ncovered under HO 8. (2)  The following is a list of power-driven machines that\nhave been determined not to be covered by HO 8: a.    \nWheel crusher or rim removing\nmachine . This machine separates a rim from a tire by using three dies attached\nto three rams to bend the tire and the metal rim.  The rim is circular metal\nstructure specially formed to fit the shape of a wheel, and not a metal plate\nor a flat piece of (sheet) metal as required by the HO.  Moreover, the purpose\nof the machine is to separate the tire from its rim and not to form the rim\ninto another shape (which would be the purpose of a bending machine).  In light\nof the preceding, a wheel crusher is not a bending machine, or any other kind\nof metal forming, punching and shearing machine, and it is not covered by\nHO 8.  b.    \nWalco Precision Roller (series 60\nand 67).  This machine is used to coat metal and other materials with paint,\nvarious adhesives, and other substances.  The machine does not form, shape, or\nreduce the thickness of metal (the function of a rolling machine) and it is not\ncovered by HO 8.  c.    \nInjection molding press.  When\nused to manufacture plastic parts (as opposed to cutting or shaping metal),\nthis machine is not covered by HO 8.  d.    \nFlox wire cut electrical discharge\nmachine.  This machine cuts metal using a brass wire as an electrode.  When the\nwire is brought near metal, an arc is created eroding the metal.  Since this\ntechnology does not cut or shape metal with tools mounted on rams, plungers, or\nother moving parts, it is not a power-driven metal forming, punching or\nshearing machine, and is not covered by HO 8. (3)  The following is a list of machine tools which are not\ncovered by HO 8: a.     Key Duplicating Machines.\nThese machines, often located in hardware stores and other retail\nestablishments, duplicate keys by using a metal cutter.  These machines are\nmachine tools and therefore outside the scope of HO 8.  An example of a key\nduplicating machine that has been determined to be a machine tool is the Axxess\nPC key machine (serial #0595187FP). b.     Ridgid 535 pipe and bolt\nthreading machine. This machine is classified as machine tool and not a\nshearing machine, even though the cutting knife has a rotary motion.  Since it is\na machine tool, it is not covered by HO 8.  c.     Landis pipe nipple and\nautomatic pipe nipple machines. These machines are considered to be machine\ntools and not covered under HO 8.  d.     Brake drum and brake\ndisc lathes .These lathes (used to repair brakes in automotive and truck repair\nshops) are turning machines and are considered machine tools.  They are outside\nthe scope of HO 8. e.     Pipe threading equipment.\nTurning machines, such as the Rigid Model 1234 Threading Machine, are

Than\nCoal.","text":"Name:  Occupations in Connection with Mining, Other than\nCoal Originally Adopted:  January 6, 1951 (a)  \nScope of HO 9 (1)  Prior to the enactment of HO 9, only coal\nmining (HO 3) was covered by a hazardous occupations order.  Since the issuance\nof HO 9, all mining, with the exception of mining in the petroleum and natural\ngas industries, falls within the scope of a hazardous occupations order.  An\ninvestigation of the mining industry concluded, in an April 1950 report, that\nall work in this industry involved an “exceptionally high degree of accident\nrisk” and the employment of young people should be prohibited in the vast\nmajority of mining occupations.  Moreover, the report cited inadequate state\nchild labor laws, which in many instances allowed children as young as 14 years\nof age to work in underground mines, as an additional reason for establishing\nHO 9. (2)  HO 9 is industry specific.  It applies to\nmetal mines, nonmetal mines, ore-dressing plants, quarries, clay pits and clay\nmines, and sand and gravel operations.  In terms of product mined, the HO\ncovers:  iron, copper, lead, zinc, and other metals, barite, gypsum, salt,\nsulfur, and other nonmetals, limestone, marble, granite, and other minerals. \nIts scope includes all occupations in connection with mining, other than coal,\nwith the exception of certain surface occupations not directly concerned with\nthe extraction or haulage of the mined material. (3)  Many occupations prohibited by HO 9 may\nalso be prohibited by other HOs.  Examples include operating motor-vehicles (HO\n2), using a power-driven chain saw to cut timber (HO 5), and operating some\nearth moving equipment while working in a tunnel (HO 17).   (4)  HO 9 does not cover work in coal mines\nwhich is prohibited by HO 3; in petroleum production; or in the production of\nnatural-gas.  The HO also does not prohibit work involving most manufacturing\nor processing operations applied to the extracted materials. (5)  Definitions a.    \nThe term all\noccupations in connection with mining, other than coal shall mean: 1.    \nAll work performed\nunderground in mines and quarries; on the surface at underground mines and\nunderground quarries; in or about open-cut mines, open quarries, clay pits, and\nsand and gravel operations; at or about placer mining operations; at or about\ndredging operations for clay, sand or gravel; at or about bore-hole mining\noperations; in or about all metal mills, washer plants, or grinding mills\nreducing the bulk of the extracted minerals and at or about any other crushing,\ngrinding, screening, sizing, washing or cleaning operations performed upon the\nextracted minerals except when those operations are performed as part of a\nmanufacturing process. 2.    \nThe term shall not\ninclude work performed in subsequent manufacturing or processing operations,\nsuch as work performed in:  smelters, electro-metallurgical plants, refineries,\nreduction plants, cement mills, plants where quarried stone is cut, sanded and\nfurther processed, or plants manufacturing clay, glass, or ceramic products.  3.    \nNeither shall the term\ninclude work performed in connection with coal mining (see HO 3,\nFOH 33h03),\nin petroleum production, in natural-gas production, nor in dredging operations\nwhich are not a part of mining operations, such as dredging for construction or\nnavigation purposes. b.    \nThe term placer mining\nshall mean the mining of a placer deposit (a surface deposit of loose particles\nof certain heavy minerals—frequently gold) utilizing the following methods: 1.    \nPlacer dredging\noperations – Operating in a pond, a placer dredge (a kind of floating washer\nplant) utilizes a series of buckets connected by a chain to scoop gravel from\nthe bottom of the pond.  The dredge is also equipped with machinery to recover\nthe heavy metal from the gravel and dispose of the refuse.  2.    \nSurface placer\noperations – This method, often called sluicing, requires a source of water\nlarge enough to make a fast-flowing stream in a sluice box.  At the upper end\nof the sluice there is a screen onto which gravel is shoveled or dumped.  Water\nruns over the gravel on the screen, washing the fine gravel through it, and the\nheavy metal is caught on a bar fastened across bottom of the sluice box. 3.    \nHydraulic placer\noperations – In this method, a powerful stream of water is used to break down\nearth and rock and guide the particles through channels into long sluices. \nDiesel power is used extensively for pumps, tractors, or for drag lines, and\nsome operations use tractors equipped with a blade to push the material to the\nsluice box. c.    \nThe term bore-hole\nmining shall mean a method of recovering some minerals (most notably sulfur and\nsalt) by pumping compressed air into the holes bored down to the deposit to\nforce the mineral to the surface. d.    \nThe term metal mill\noperations shall mean a highly automated operation requiring few employees\nconsisting of three distinct steps:   1.    \nPreparation (crushing,\ngrinding, cleaning, and classifying),  2.    \nSeparation (jigging,\ntabling, heavy-media separation, and froth flotation), and  3.    \nFinishing (including\nsettling, filtering, drying, and otherwise preparing the concentrates for\nshipment). e.    \nThe term washer plant\noperations shall mean an operation performed to the ore after it is mined to\nremove clay and dirt form the solids. f.     \nThe term grinding mill\noperations shall mean the reduction of the concentrate into a powder form at a\ngrinding mill.  This operation that occurs after the ore is cleansed at a\nwasher plant. (b)  \nOccupations\nPROHIBITED (1)  All occupations involving underground work\nin mines or underground quarries. (2)  All surface occupations at underground\nmines unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(1). (3)  All occupations involving work in or about\nopen cut mines, open quarries (including crushing, screening, and washing),\nclay pits (including dredging), and sand and gravel operations (including\ndredging, washing, and screening), unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(2). (4)  All occupations involving work at or about\nplacer mining and bore-hole mining operations, unless otherwise permitted by\nFOH 33h09(c)(1). (5)  All occupations involving work in metal\nmills, unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(2). (6)  All occupations involving work in washer\nplants or grinding mills, unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(1). (c)  \nOccupations NOT\nSPECIFICALLY BANNED (1)  The following occupations are permitted\nfor 16- and 17- year-olds when performed at the surface of underground mines;\nin or about open pit mines, open quarries, clay pits and sand and grave\noperations; in surface placer mines, including placer dredging operations,\nhydraulic placer mining operations and bore-hole mining operations; and in\nwasher plants or grinding mills: a.    \nWork in offices, in\nthe warehouse or supply house, in the change house, in the laboratory, and in\nrepair or maintenance shops not located underground.  In the case of open\nquarries and other types of open-pit operations, this work is permitted in the\npit or quarry proper, but not outside of the building itself. b.    \nWork in the operation\nand maintenance of living quarters (Some of this work may be prohibited by\nanother HO). c.    \nWork outside of the\nmine in surveying, in the repair and maintenance of roads, and in general\nclean-up about the mine property (such as clearing brush and digging drainage\nditches).  This work is not permitted when done underground or in an open\nquarry or pit.  For example, maintenance of roads in an open-cut mine would\nonly be allowed if it was done outside of the open-cut. (2)  The following work is permitted in metal mills:   a.    \nWork involving the operation of\njigs, sludge tables, flotation cells, or drier-filters. b.    \nHand-sorting work at picking table\nor a picking belt. c.    \nGeneral clean-up work. d.    \nWork of track crews in the building\nand maintenance of railroad tracks located in an area of an open-cut metal\nmine, if haulage and mining activities are not being conducted where the track\ncrew is working.  This exception applies only to metal mines, since such\noperations are vast in scale, much of the track work is physically removed from\nthe extractive operation, and the track crew can work without undue exposure to\nhazard. e.    \nThe only work permitted in\nmercury-recovery mills or mills using the cyanide process is the kind of work\nstated in FOH 33h09(c)(1) above. (d)  \nExemptions There are no provisions in HO 9 for apprentices or\nstudent-learners.  There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.   (e)  \nEnforcement\npositions (1)  Peat moss HO 9 does\nnot apply to cutting, gathering, piling or any other occupation performed on\npeat moss.  Peat moss is defined as partially decomposed sphagnum;\nconsequently, it is not a mineral within the meaning of this order and any\nactivities performed on it or to it would not be “occupations in connection with\nmining.” (2)  Motor-vehicle operator and outside helper HO 9\nprohibits almost all work in or about a mine, which would include the\noccupations of motor-vehicle driver and outside helper.  HO 2 also specifically\nprohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from performing the occupations of motor-vehicle\ndriver and outside helper in or about any mine, including an open pit mine or\nquarry.   (3)  Weighing trucks The\nweighing of trucks filled with gravel, crushed stone, or other minerals is\nprohibited by HO 9.  This work is prohibited even if the minors spend only a\nsmall percentage of their time weighing trucks and the majority of their work\nis confined to an office environment.   (4)  Processing stockpiled limestone into lime HO 9 does\nnot apply to occupations involved in the processing of stockpiled limestone\ninto hydrated lime.  This process is deemed to be manufacturing and not mining\n(the crushed stockpiled limestone is heated at extreme temperatures to create\nquicklime, water is then added to the quicklime to make hydrated lime which is\nshipped to the consumer).  The prohibitions of HO 9 would cease to apply when\nthe extracted, crushed, and screened limestone was stockpiled. (5)  Railroad track work Track work\nperformed three miles from the open quarry is not an occupation prohibited by\nHO 9 as the work is not in close proximity to the mining haulage or to mining\nactivities.  (6)  Processing marble into a finished building\nproduct a.    \nThe prohibitions of HO\n9 apply to occupations in the processing of marble into a finished building\nmaterial when it involves the following steps:  the marble is quarried, run\nthrough a primary crusher, through a secondary crusher or grinding operation, and\nthen into elevated storage bins.  The finished product is loaded from these\nbins into bulk trucks or it is sacked and stored for later shipment.   b.     This process is not deemed to be\nmanufacturing since the marble has not been chemically changed and nothing was\nmanufactured from the crushed marble (i.e. bricks, blocks, tile, etc.)","html":"<p>Name:  Occupations in Connection with Mining, Other than\nCoal</p><p>Originally Adopted:  January 6,

or dumped.  Water\nruns over the gravel on the screen, washing the fine gravel through it, and the\nheavy metal is caught on a bar fastened across bottom of the sluice box.</p><p>3.    \nHydraulic placer\noperations – In this method, a powerful stream of water is used to break down\nearth and rock and guide the particles through channels into long sluices. \nDiesel power is used extensively for pumps, tractors, or for drag lines, and\nsome operations use tractors equipped with a blade to push the material to the\nsluice box.</p><p>c.    \nThe term bore-hole\nmining shall mean a method of recovering some minerals (most notably sulfur and\nsalt) by pumping compressed air into the holes bored down to the deposit to\nforce the mineral to the surface.</p><p>d.    \nThe term metal mill\noperations shall mean a highly automated operation requiring few employees\nconsisting of three distinct steps:  </p><p>1.    \nPreparation (crushing,\ngrinding, cleaning, and classifying), </p><p>2.    \nSeparation (jigging,\ntabling, heavy-media separation, and froth flotation), and </p><p>3.    \nFinishing (including\nsettling, filtering, drying, and otherwise preparing the concentrates for\nshipment).</p><p>e.    \nThe term washer plant\noperations shall mean an operation performed to the ore after it is mined to\nremove clay and dirt form the solids.</p><p>f.     \nThe term grinding mill\noperations shall mean the reduction of the concentrate into a powder form at a\ngrinding mill.  This operation that occurs after the ore is cleansed at a\nwasher plant.</p><p>(b)  \n<b>Occupations\nPROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  All occupations involving underground work\nin mines or underground quarries.</p><p>(2)  All surface occupations at underground\nmines

sand and grave\noperations; in surface placer mines, including placer dredging operations,\nhydraulic placer mining operations and bore-hole mining operations; and in\nwasher plants or grinding mills:</p><p>a.    \nWork in offices, in\nthe warehouse or supply house, in the change house, in the laboratory, and in\nrepair or maintenance shops not located underground.  In the case of open\nquarries and other types of open-pit operations, this work is permitted in the\npit or quarry proper, but not outside of the building itself.</p><p>b.    \nWork in the operation\nand maintenance

</p><p>(e)  \n<b>Enforcement\npositions</b></p><p>(1)  Peat moss</p><p>HO 9 does\nnot apply to cutting, gathering, piling or any other occupation performed on\npeat moss.  Peat moss is defined as partially decomposed sphagnum;\nconsequently, it is not a mineral within the meaning of this order and any\nactivities performed on it or to it would not be “occupations in connection with\nmining.”</p><p>(2)  Motor-vehicle operator and outside helper</p><p>HO 9\nprohibits almost all work in or about a mine, which would include the\noccupations of motor-vehicle driver and outside helper.  HO 2 also specifically\nprohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from performing the occupations of motor-vehicle\ndriver and outside helper in or about any mine, including an open pit mine or\nquarry.  </p><p>(3)  Weighing trucks</p><p>The\nweighing of trucks filled with gravel, crushed stone, or other minerals is\nprohibited by HO 9.  This work is prohibited even if the minors spend only a\nsmall percentage of their time weighing trucks and the majority of their work\nis confined to an office environment.  </p><p>(4)  Processing stockpiled limestone into lime</p><p>HO 9 does\nnot apply to occupations involved in the processing of stockpiled limestone\ninto hydrated lime.  This process is deemed to be manufacturing and not mining\n(the crushed stockpiled limestone is heated at extreme temperatures to create\nquicklime, water is then added to the quicklime to make hydrated lime which is\nshipped to the consumer).  The prohibitions of HO 9 would cease to apply when\nthe extracted, crushed, and screened limestone was stockpiled.</p><p>(5)  Railroad track work</p><p>Track work\nperformed three miles from the open quarry is not an occupation prohibited by\nHO 9 as the work is not in close proximity to the mining haulage or to mining\nactivities. </p><p>(6)  Processing marble into a finished building\nproduct</p><p>a.    \nThe prohibitions of HO\n9 apply to occupations in the processing of marble into a finished building\nmaterial when it involves the following steps:  the marble is quarried, run\nthrough a primary crusher, through a secondary crusher or grinding operation, and\nthen into elevated storage bins.  The finished product is loaded from these\nbins into bulk trucks or it is sacked and stored for later shipment.  </p><p><b>b.     </b>This process is not deemed to be\nmanufacturing since the marble has not been chemically changed and nothing was\nmanufactured from the crushed marble (i.e. bricks, blocks, tile,

operation of power-driven meat-processing machines\nand occupations involving slaughtering, meat and poultry packing, processing,\nor rendering. Originally Adopted:  May 8, 1952 (a)  \nScope of HO 10 (1)  Meat-packing was one of the most hazardous industries\nat the time HO 10 was promulgated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics issued\nBulletin No. 855 (Injuries and Accident Causes in the Slaughtering and\nMeat-Packing Industries, 1943), which documented the hazards in this industry. \nDangers included slips and falls on slippery floors, injuries from live\nanimals, strains from overlifting, cutting hazards from sharp knives, and\ninjuries from power-driven equipment.  More recent publications issued by the\nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) confirm the\ncontinued existence of these hazards and also cite the danger of steam burns,\nelectric shock, and ergonomic injuries and illnesses. (2)  HO 10 originally applied only to occupations in the\nslaughtering, rendering, and meat packing industries.  When Congress amended\nthe FLSA in 1961 to cover certain retail and service enterprises, WH amended HO\n10 to cover work in such firms.  Thus, HO 10 applies both on an industry basis\n(slaughtering, rendering, and meat-packing) and to the use of certain\npower-driven meat-processing machines (including meat slicers) whenever located\nin covered establishments and regardless of the material being processed.  In\n1981, HO 10 was again amended to clarify that restaurants, fast-food\nestablishments, and other retail and service establishments are subject to\nHO 10 and that 16- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from using power-driven\nmeat processing equipment in those establishments. (3)  HO 10 was amended in 1960 to add the occupations of\nsetting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning certain power-driven\nmeat-processing machines.  Prior to this, only the occupations of operating or\nfeeding the various named machines were prohibited by HO 10.  The 2010\nrevisions to HO 10 clarified that youth under 18 may not clean power-driven\nmeat processing equipment, including the disassembled parts.  This is true even\nif the equipment is disassembled and reassembled by an adult.  Such youth may\noperate a commercial dishwasher to run a self-contained rack containing parts\nof or attachments to a power-driven meat processing machine through the\ndishwasher as long as the youth does not actually handle or touch the machine\nparts or attachments (see 75 FR 28435, see also § 570.61(a)(4)). (4)  HO 10 was revised in 2010 and its prohibitions were\nextended to the slaughtering and processing of poultry.  The term slaughtering\nand meat packing establishments was redefined to include places where poultry,\nbuffalo, or deer, are killed, butchered, or processed.  The term now also\nincludes establishments which manufacture or process meat or poultry products including\nsausage or sausage casings from animals (see 75 FR 28434, see also\n§ 570.61(b)). (5)  HO 10 does not apply to the killing and processing of\nrabbits or small game in areas physically separated from the “killing floor”,\nor in separate establishments.  It also does not apply to fish and seafood\nprocessing plants.  These establishments were not included in the original\nstudy of meat-packing plants, were specifically excluded from the Order when it\nwas issued, and amendments to the HO have not incorporated these\nestablishments.   (6)  Definitions a.    \nThe term retail/wholesale or\nservice establishments includes establishments where meat or meat products,\nincluding poultry, are processed or handled, such as butcher shops, grocery\nstores, restaurants and quick service food establishments, hotels,\ndelicatessens, and meat-locker (freezer-locker) companies, and establishments\nwhere any food product is prepared or processed for serving to customers using\nmachines prohibited by this HO. b.    \nThe term slaughtering and\nmeat-packing establishments means places in or about which such animals as\ncattle, calves, hogs, poultry, sheep, lambs, goats, buffalo, deer, or horses\nare killed, butchered, or processed.  The term also includes establishments which\nmanufacture or process meat products or sausage casings from such animals.  c.    \nThe term rendering plants means\nestablishments engaged in the conversion of dead animals, animal offal, animal\nfats, scrap meats, blood, and bones into stock feeds, tallow, inedible greases,\nfertilizer ingredients, and similar products. d.    \nThe term killing floor includes a\nworkroom, workplace where such animals as cattle, calves, hogs, poultry, sheep,\nlambs, goats, buffalo, deer, or horses are immobilized, shackled, or killed, and\nthe carcasses are dressed prior to chilling.  The killing floor does not\ninclude coolers. e.    \nThe term curing cellar includes a\nworkroom or workplace which is primarily devoted to the preservation and\nflavoring of meat, including poultry, by curing materials.  It does not include\na workroom or workplace solely where meats are smoked.  The curing cellar may\nbe located above or below ground. f.     \nThe term hide cellar includes a\nworkroom or workplace where hides are graded, trimmed, salted, and otherwise\ncured.  The hide cellar may be located above or below ground. g.    \nThe term boning occupations means\nthe removal of bones from meat cuts.  It does not include work that involves\ncutting, scraping, or trimming meat from cuts containing bones. (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED (1)  HO 10 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from employment\nin all occupations involving the operation or feeding of the following\npower-driven machines, including setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or\ncleaning of such machines or the individual parts of such machines, regardless\nof

adjusting, repairing, oiling, or\ncleaning power-driven bacon-slicing machines and belly-rolling machines.  The\nterm “bacon-slicing machine” as used in HO 10 refers to those machines which\nare designed solely for the purpose of slicing bacon and are equipped with\nenclosure or barrier guards that prevent the operator from coming in contact\nwith the blade or blades, and with devices for automatic feeding, slicing,\nshingling, stacking, and conveying the sliced bacon away from the point of\noperation. (d)  \nExemptions HO 10 does contain an exemption for apprentices and student-learners. \nNo other exemptions are applicable to this order. (e)  \nEnforcement positions (1)  Application of HO 10 to handling of hot\noils a.    \nThe original HO 10\nbanned, among other things, employment of minors in occupations involved in the\nrecovery of lard and oils from slaughtered animals, and the rendering of animal\nfat.  When Congress amended the FLSA in 1961 to cover certain retail and\nservice enterprises, the Department of Labor amended HO 10 to extend to retail\nestablishments, including fast food and full-service restaurants.  Many such\nrestaurants use commercial deep-fat fryers which have various attachments or\nbuilt-in features to facilitate the refining and/or recycling of cooking fats\nor oils. b.    \nThe refining, removing\nand/or recycling of cooking fats or oils in restaurants is not a process of\n“rendering” or “recovery” as described in the original HO 10 (see\n29 CFR 570.61(a)(2) and (3)); neither is such refining, removing\nand/or recycling of cooking fats or oils covered by any other provision of HO\n10.  Furthermore, there was no specific change in the FLSA in 1961 to indicate\nany Congressional intent to include within the HO 10 prohibition, the handling\nof cooking fats or oils in restaurants.   c.    \nConsequently, HO 10\ndoes not prohibit minors under age 18 from being employed to clean such\nrestaurant machines, to remove cooking fats or oils from them, or to clean the\nscreening or filtering equipment.   d.    \nHowever, CL Reg 3 does\nprohibit 14- and 15-year-olds from cleaning kitchen equipment (not otherwise\nprohibited), removing oil or grease filters, pouring oil or grease through\nfilters, and moving receptacles containing hot grease or hot oil, when the\nequipment, surfaces, containers, and liquids exceed a temperature of 100 °F\n(see FOH 33c05(b)(1)a.). (2)  Application of HO 10 to power-driven meat processing\nmachines and bakery machines with attachments a.    \nA meat slicer with a chute\nattachment for processing hard-to-handle foods is covered by HO 10 as long as\nthe meat-cutting blades are used, even though only non-meat items are being\nprocessed.  Consequently, a 16- or 17-year-old may not operate, dismantle,\nreassemble, or clean this machine.   b.    \n“Food processors” are prohibited\nif used to process meat.  Likewise, bakery machines such as vertical dough\nmixers that have meat-processing attachments are covered by HO 10 when used to\nprocess meat; and HO 11 when used to process dough.  (3)  Cleaning of power-driven meat-processing\nmachines a.    \nHO 10 prohibits minors under 18\nyears of age from cleaning power-driven meat processing machines.  This\nprohibition includes the cleaning of the individual parts of such machines,\nincluding the blades—even if the machine is dismantled and reassembled by an\nadult (see 29 CFR 570.61(a)(4)).  However, such youth may operate a dishwasher\nto run a self-contained rack containing such individual parts through the\ndishwasher if the youth does not handle or touch the parts (see FOH\n33h10(a)(3)). b.    \n29 CFR 570.33(e) prohibits the\nemployment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations which involve operating, tending,\nsetting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing power-driven food slicers\nand grinders, food choppers, food processors, food cutters, and food mixers.   (4)  Power-driven machines determined to be subject to HO\n10: a.    \nFood processors when used to process\nmeats. b.    \nFood grinders, pureeing wands, and\nmixers if designed to be used or used on meat.  This same equipment could be\nprohibited by HO 11 if used to mix items such as batter. c.    \nMeat choppers when used to grind\nor chop cheese or other products. d.    \nLiver-skinning machine used to\nskin squid or other seafood products. e.    \nMeat-slicers with tubular feeding\nattachments. (5)  Power-driven machines determined not to be subject to\nHO 10: a.    \nMeat tenderizers and meat cubers. b.    \nFood processors with attachments\nused only for processing vegetables. c.    \nLightweight, small capacity,\nportable, countertop mixers discussed in § 570.62(b)(1) and in\nFOH 33h11(d) when not used to process meat).    d.    \nPrawnto Shrimp Machine used to\ndevein and cut shrimp. e.    \nJonsson Shrimp Peeling Machine used\nto peel shrimp. f.     \nVegetable slicers. g.    \nColton Granulator used to force\nproducts through a set of grinder bars and forces the reduced sized products\nthrough a preset mesh screen (i.e. granulator is not a meat grinder).","html":"<p>Occupations in the operation of power-driven meat-processing machines\nand occupations involving slaughtering, meat and poultry packing, processing,\nor rendering.</p><p>Originally Adopted:  May 8, 1952</p><p>(a)  \n<b>Scope of HO 10</b></p><p>(1)  Meat-packing was one of the most hazardous industries\nat the time HO 10 was promulgated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics issued\nBulletin No. 855 (Injuries and Accident Causes in the Slaughtering and\nMeat-Packing Industries, 1943), which documented the hazards in this industry. \nDangers included slips and falls on slippery floors, injuries from live\nanimals, strains from overlifting, cutting hazards from sharp knives, and\ninjuries from power-driven equipment.  More recent publications issued by the\nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) confirm the\ncontinued existence of these hazards and also cite the danger of steam burns,\nelectric shock, and ergonomic injuries and illnesses.</p><p>(2)  HO 10 originally applied only to occupations in the\nslaughtering, rendering, and meat packing industries.  When Congress amended\nthe FLSA in 1961 to cover certain retail and service enterprises, WH amended HO\n10 to cover work in such firms.  Thus, HO 10 applies both on an industry basis\n(slaughtering, rendering, and meat-packing) and to the use of certain\npower-driven meat-processing machines (including meat slicers) whenever located\nin covered establishments and regardless of the material being processed.  In\n1981, HO 10 was again amended to clarify that restaurants, fast-food\nestablishments, and other retail and service establishments are subject to\nHO 10 and that 16- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from using power-driven\nmeat processing equipment in those establishments.</p><p>(3)  HO 10 was amended in 1960 to add the occupations of\nsetting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning certain power-driven\nmeat-processing machines.  Prior to this, only the occupations of operating or\nfeeding the various named machines were prohibited by HO 10.  The 2010\nrevisions to HO 10 clarified that youth under 18 may not clean power-driven\nmeat processing equipment, including the disassembled parts.  This is true even\nif the equipment is disassembled and reassembled by an adult.  Such youth may\noperate a commercial dishwasher to run a self-contained rack containing parts\nof or attachments to a power-driven meat processing machine through the\ndishwasher as long as the youth does not actually handle or touch the machine\nparts or attachments (see 75 FR 28435, see also § 570.61(a)(4)).</p><p>(4)  HO 10 was revised in 2010 and its prohibitions were\nextended to the slaughtering and processing of poultry.  The term slaughtering\nand meat packing establishments was redefined to include places where poultry,\nbuffalo, or deer, are killed, butchered, or processed.  The term now also\nincludes establishments which manufacture or process meat or poultry products including\nsausage or sausage casings from animals (see 75 FR 28434, see also\n§ 570.61(b)).</p><p>(5)  HO 10 does not apply to the killing and processing of\nrabbits or small game in areas physically separated from the “killing floor”,\nor in separate establishments.  It also does not apply to fish and seafood\nprocessing plants.  These establishments were not included in the original\nstudy of meat-packing plants, were specifically excluded from the Order when it\nwas issued, and amendments to the HO have not incorporated these\nestablishments.  </p><p>(6)  Definitions</p><p>a.    \nThe term retail/wholesale or\nservice establishments includes establishments where meat or meat products,\nincluding poultry, are processed or handled, such as butcher shops, grocery\nstores, restaurants and quick service food establishments, hotels,\ndelicatessens, and meat-locker (freezer-locker) companies, and establishments\nwhere any food product is prepared or processed for serving to customers using\nmachines prohibited by this HO.</p><p>b.    \nThe term slaughtering and\nmeat-packing establishments means places in or about which such animals as\ncattle, calves, hogs, poultry, sheep, lambs, goats, buffalo, deer, or horses\nare killed, butchered, or processed.  The term also includes establishments which\nmanufacture or process meat products or sausage casings from such animals. </p><p>c.    \nThe term rendering plants means\nestablishments engaged in the conversion of dead animals, animal offal, animal\nfats, scrap meats, blood, and bones into stock feeds, tallow, inedible greases,\nfertilizer ingredients, and similar products.</p><p>d.    \nThe term killing floor includes a\nworkroom, workplace where such animals as cattle, calves, hogs, poultry, sheep,\nlambs, goats, buffalo, deer, or horses are immobilized, shackled, or killed, and\nthe carcasses are dressed prior to chilling.  The killing floor does not\ninclude coolers.</p><p>e.    \nThe term curing cellar includes a\nworkroom or workplace which is primarily devoted to the preservation and\nflavoring of meat, including poultry, by curing materials.  It does not include\na workroom or workplace solely where meats are smoked.  The curing cellar may\nbe located above or below ground.</p><p>f.     \nThe term hide cellar includes a\nworkroom or workplace where hides are graded, trimmed, salted, and otherwise\ncured.  The hide cellar may be located above or below ground.</p><p>g.    \nThe term boning occupations means\nthe removal of bones from meat cuts.  It does not include work that involves\ncutting, scraping, or trimming meat from cuts containing bones.</p><p>(b)  \n<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  HO 10 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from employment\nin all occupations involving the operation or feeding of the following\npower-driven machines, including setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or\ncleaning of such machines or the individual parts of such machines, regardless\nof the product being processed by these machines

exemption for apprentices and student-learners. \nNo other exemptions are applicable to this order.</p><p>(e)  \n<b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  Application of HO 10 to handling of hot\noils</p><p>a.    \nThe original HO 10\nbanned, among other things, employment of minors in occupations involved in the\nrecovery of lard and oils from slaughtered animals, and the rendering of animal\nfat.  When Congress amended the FLSA in 1961 to cover certain retail and\nservice enterprises, the Department of Labor amended HO 10 to extend to retail\nestablishments, including fast food and full-service restaurants.  Many such\nrestaurants use commercial deep-fat fryers which have various attachments or\nbuilt-in features to facilitate the refining and/or recycling of cooking fats\nor oils.</p><p>b.    \nThe refining, removing\nand/or recycling of cooking fats or oils in restaurants is not a process of\n“rendering” or “recovery” as described in the original HO 10 (see\n29 CFR 570.61(a)(2) and (3)); neither is such refining, removing\nand/or recycling of cooking fats or oils covered by any other provision of HO\n10.  Furthermore, there was no specific change in the FLSA in 1961 to indicate\nany Congressional intent to include within the HO 10 prohibition, the handling\nof cooking fats or oils in restaurants.  </p><p>c.    \nConsequently, HO 10\ndoes not prohibit minors under age 18 from being employed to clean such\nrestaurant machines, to remove cooking fats or oils from them, or to clean the\nscreening or filtering equipment.  </p><p>d.    \nHowever, CL Reg 3 does\nprohibit 14- and 15-year-olds from cleaning kitchen equipment (not otherwise\nprohibited), removing oil or grease filters, pouring oil or grease through\nfilters, and moving receptacles containing hot grease or hot oil, when the\nequipment, surfaces, containers, and liquids exceed a temperature of 100 °F\n(see FOH 33c05(b)(1)a.).</p><p>(2)  Application of HO 10 to power-driven meat processing\nmachines and bakery machines with attachments</p><p>a.    \nA meat slicer with a chute\nattachment for processing hard-to-handle foods is covered by HO 10 as long as\nthe meat-cutting blades are used, even though only non-meat items are being\nprocessed.  Consequently, a 16- or 17-year-old may not operate, dismantle,\nreassemble, or clean this machine.  </p><p>b.    \n“Food processors” are prohibited\nif used to process meat.  Likewise, bakery machines such as vertical dough\nmixers that have meat-processing attachments are covered by HO 10 when used to\nprocess meat; and HO 11 when used to process dough. </p><p>(3)  Cleaning of power-driven meat-processing\nmachines </p><p>a.    \nHO 10 prohibits minors under 18\nyears of age from cleaning power-driven meat processing machines.  This\nprohibition includes the cleaning of the individual parts of such machines,\nincluding the blades—even if the machine is dismantled and reassembled by an\nadult (see 29 CFR 570.61(a)(4)).  However, such youth may operate a dishwasher\nto run a self-contained rack containing such individual parts through the\ndishwasher if the youth does not handle or touch the parts (see FOH\n33h10(a)(3)).</p><p>b.    \n29 CFR 570.33(e) prohibits the\nemployment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations which involve operating, tending,\nsetting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing power-driven food slicers\nand grinders, food choppers, food processors, food cutters, and food mixers.  </p><p>(4)  Power-driven machines determined to be subject to HO\n10:</p><p>a.    \nFood processors when used to process\nmeats.</p><p>b.    \nFood grinders, pureeing wands, and\nmixers if designed to be used or used on meat.  This same equipment could be\nprohibited by HO 11 if used to mix items such as batter.</p><p>c.    \nMeat choppers when used to grind\nor chop cheese or other products.</p><p>d.    \nLiver-skinning machine used to\nskin squid or other seafood products.</p><p>e.    \nMeat-slicers with tubular feeding\nattachments.</p><p>(5)  Power-driven machines determined not to be subject to\nHO 10:</p><p>a.    \nMeat tenderizers and meat cubers.</p><p>b.    \nFood processors with attachments\nused only for processing vegetables.</p><p>c.    \nLightweight, small capacity,\nportable, countertop mixers discussed in

Occupations Involved in the Operation of Bakery Machines Originally Adopted:  July 21, 1952 (a)  \nScope of HO 11  (1)  Historically, many occupational injuries occurring in\nbakeries are caused by a few specific machines.  These injuries are often\nserious, producing a disproportionate share of deaths or permanent\ndisabilities.  HO 11 was issued to prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from operating\ncertain power-driven bakery machines.  This HO is machine-specific as discussed\nin FOH 33h00.  The operation by 16- and 17-year-olds of other bakery machines\nnot specifically prohibited by the order, while not encouraged, is permitted. (2)  This order became effective prior to the 1961 and 1966\nFLSA amendments which brought many previously uncovered retail bakeries and\nstores under the CL provisions.  Some machines prohibited by HO 11 are found in\nretail bakeries, pizzerias, restaurants and other food service establishments –\nothers are only found in wholesale bakeries.  Violations often occur in small\nbakeries where there is little division of labor and most jobs are performed by\nall employees.   (3)  The scope of this order includes, among other\nactivities, operating, assisting to operate and cleaning the named machines\nwherever found in a covered establishment.  Manually operated (not\npower-driven) machines are outside the scope of HO 11.  Assisting to operate\nthe named machines includes the loading of ingredients into the machines – such\nas the placing of flour into a mixer – even when the machines are “turned off”\nwhen the loading is performed.   (4)  HO 11 was revised in the 2010 Final Rule to include\ntwo exceptions related to certain lightweight, counter-top food mixers and\ncertain pizza-dough rollers (see FOH 33h11(d)(2) and (d)(3)). (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED Sixteen- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from operating, assisting to\noperate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning the following\npower-driven bakery machines: (1)  Horizontal dough mixer—a horizontal cylinder with a\nhorizontal shaft with mixing arms; revolves to mix the flour with water, yeast,\nsalt, etc. to make dough.  This prohibition includes operating a dough\nauger/feeder used to process masa for tortillas or tamales.   (2)  Vertical dough mixer—a large bowl in which a vertical\nspindle with paddles attached mixes flour, water, etc. to make dough (often\nused in small bakery and some pizzerias).   (3)  Batter mixer—very similar to vertical dough mixer,\nexcept different shaped paddles are used; often used for making cake batter. \nPower-driven “wands” used to mix items such as batters are also prohibited. (4)  Bread and/or roll dividing, rounding, or molding\nmachines—in the past, separate machines performed the operation of dividing,\nrounding, and molding of dough for bread and rolls.  More modern machines are\nmultifunctional and may perform two or all three of these operations.  The\nprocess involves cutting dough into lumps (for one loaf or batch of rolls),\nrolling each lump into a ball, and after “proofing”, forming a loaf or a batch\nof rolls.  The operation is often continuous, dough being carried from one\nmachine to another by conveyor. (5)  Dough brake—a machine which rolls dough into sheets. (6)  Dough sheeter—a machine which rolls dough into very\nthin sheets.  This prohibition includes pizza dough rollers and tortilla\nroller/molders (also called moulders); but see special exception for operators\nof pizza dough rollers discussed in FOH 33h11(d)(3). (7)  Combination bread-slicing and wrapping machine—a\nmachine that slices a loaf of bread and wraps it in a continuous process\n(generally only found in large, wholesale type bakeries). (8)  Cake cutting band saw—a machine for cutting baked\ncakes into squares or rectangles. (9)  Cookie and cracker machine—combination machines which\nform cookies or crackers from dough.  The operation is continuous, dough\nentering at one end and complete cookies or crackers, ready for baking,\nemerging at the other end.  Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may serve on a cookie and\ncracker machine crew which actually operates the machine while producing\ncookies or crackers.  These minors, however, may not set up or adjust these\nmachines (see FOH 33h11(c)(7)). (c)  \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED There are a number of occupations involving the operation of\npower-driven machines in industrial and retail bakeries that are permitted for\n16-and 17-year-old minors, including the following:  (1)  Ingredient preparation and mixing—flour-sifting\nmachine operator, flour-blending machine operator and sack-cleaning machine\noperator. (2)  Product forming and shaping—batter-sealing machine\noperator, depositing machine operator, cookie or cracker machine crew member\n(but not involving the setting up or adjusting of the machine), wafer machine\noperator, pretzel-stick machine operator, pie-dough sealing machine operator,\npie-dough rolling machine operator, pie-crimping machine operator, and wedge\npress operator.   a.    \nA wedge press is a machine that\nuses two plates, often one of which is heated, to press balls of dough into the\ndesired shape.  Such presses are often used to shape tortillas. b.    \nBecause the original study that\nled to HO 11 did not address such presses which do not utilize “rollers,” and\nsubsequent rulemaking did not expand the scope of the HO in this respect, HO 11\ndoes not prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from operating such machines. (3)  Finishing and Icing—depositing machine operator,\nenrobing machine operator, spray machine operator, icing mixing machine\noperator. (4)  Slicing and Wrapping –roll slicing and wrapping\nmachine operator, cake wrapping machine operator, carton packing and sealing\nmachine operator.  (5)  Pan washing—spray-type pan washing machine operator,\ntumbler-type pan washing machine operator. (6)  Donut and pastry filling—donut and pastry filling\nmachines, including Homogenette and similar machines which automatically inject\nfillings into donuts and pastries.  (7)  Cookie or Cracker Machine Crew Member—Sixteen- and\n17-year-olds may work on a crew operating a cookie or cracker machine.  These\nmachines, found in some wholesale bakeries, usually require crews of two to six\npersons.  But minors may not perform work involving the setting up or adjusting\nof the cookie or cracker machine.  These tasks, more hazardous than the\noperation of the machine during production, are usually performed by the crew\nchief (see FOH 33h11(b)(9)). (8)  Bread slicing—Sixteen- and 17-year-old bakery or deli\nclerks may operate bread slicing and roll slicing machines of the type usually\nfound in retail bakeries. (9)  Cleaning individual parts of power-driven bakery\nmachines   a.    \nHO 11 prohibits minors under 18\nyears of age from cleaning power-driven bakery machines, but this prohibition\ndoes not apply to the cleaning of the individual parts of such machines.  Only\nemployees over 18 years of age may dismantle or reassemble such machines.   b.    \n29 CFR  570.33(e) prohibits the\nemployment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations which involve operating,\ntending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing power-driven\nfood mixers.  Such minors may, however, clean the disassembled parts of such\nmachines.   (d)  \nExemptions  (1)  There are no provisions in HO 11 for apprentices or\nstudent-learners.  There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.   (2)  Application of HO 11 to lightweight, small capacity,\ncounter-top food mixers. a.    \nSection 570.62(b)(1), effective\nJuly 19, 2010, provides an exception that allows 17- and 18-year-olds to\noperate, set up, adjust, repair, oil and clean lightweight, small capacity,\nportable counter-top power-driven food mixers that are, or comparable to,\nmodels intended for household use. b.    \nFor purposes of this exemption, a\nlightweight, small capacity mixer is one that is not hardwired into the\nestablishment’s power source, is equipped with a motor that operates at no more\nthan ½ horsepower, and is equipped with a bowl with a capacity of no more than\nfive quarts. c.    \nThis exemption shall not apply\nwhen the mixer is used, with or without attachments, to process meat or poultry\nproducts as prohibited by 29 CFR 570.61(a)(4). d.    \nThis exemption does not extend to\nthe employment of 14- and 15-year-old workers.  Minors under 16 years of age\nare prohibited from operating or tending power-driven machinery, including\nmixers, by CL Reg 3 (see 29 CFR 570.33(e)).  That regulation\nprohibits such minors from operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning,\noiling, or repairing food mixers. e.    \nWH has determined that the\nfollowing mixers are the type that would normally fall within this limited\nexemption contained at 29 CFR 570.62(b)(1). f.     \nThe K-Tec Batter Mixer Model LJS\ndeveloped for the Long John Silvers quick service restaurant chain.  The Model\nLJS weighs about 8 pounds, is 11 inches in height, has a 3-quart capacity, and\noperates at 1/16 horsepower.  g.    \nThe Kitchen Aide counter top mixer\nModel K5SSWH, which is available for home use, weighs 29 pounds, is 16.4 inches\nin height, has a 5 quart capacity, and operates at 6/15 horsepower.   (3)  Application of HO 11 to certain power-driven\npizza-dough rollers a.    \nPizza-dough rollers, a type of\ndough sheeter, are normally prohibited under HO 11.  But § 570.62(b)(2)\ncontains an exception that permits the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to\noperate certain pizza-dough rollers that meet the following conditions: 1.    \nThey are constructed with\nsafeguards contained in the basic design so as to prevent fingers, hands, or\nclothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers,  2.    \nThey have gears that are\ncompletely enclosed, and  3.    \nThey have microswitches that\ndisengage the machinery if the backs or sides of the rollers are removed.   b.    \nThis exception applies only when\nall the safeguards in 1. through 3. above are present on the machine, are\noperational, and have not been overridden.   c.    \nThe policy described in (a) above\ndoes not extend to minors who set up, adjust, repair, oil or clean the assembled\nmachine.  (e)  \nEnforcement positions (1)  Operation and cleaning of power-driven bagel slicers a.    \nBagel slicers which operate as\nelectric knives   Sixteen- and 17-year-old employees may operate and clean power-driven\nbagel slicers, such as the Edgecraft Chef’s Choice Bagel Pro Bagel Slicer,\nwhich have two blades mounted next to each other running in opposing\ndirections.  b.    \nBagel slicers with circular cutting\nblades  1.    \nSome power-driven bagel slicers,\nlike the Oliver Products Bagel and Bun Slicer (Model 702) meet the definition\nof a circular saw under HO 14.  These machines saw bagels in half by means of a\nthin steel disc, having a continuous series of notches or teeth on the\nperiphery, mounted on shafting.  Although HO 11 does not address such bagel\nslicers, HO 14 would normally prohibit employees under 18 years of age from\noperating, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning such machines. 2.    \nAt the request of WH, the National\nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has examined the operation\nof these machines and has advised WH that employees 16 and 17 years of age who\noperate and clean such slicers (with circular blades and enclosed feed chutes)\nare exposed to low safety risks.  NIOSH cited the machine’s adjustable guard\nand the manufacturer’s warning sign as important contributors to this low\ndegree of risk. 3.    \nWH will not assert a violation of\nHO 14 when 16- and 17-year-old employees operate a power-driven bagel slicer\nwith a circular blade and enclosed feed chute when the machine is equipped with\nan adjustable guard that covers the feed chute and the manufacturer’s warning\nsign is affixed to the machine.  WH will not assert a violation of HO 14 when\n16- and 17-year-old employees clean such machines.  Such minors, however,\ncontinue to be prohibited from setting up, adjusting, repairing, or oiling such\nmachines. c.    \nAll power-driven bagel slicers are\n“food slicers” under CL Reg 3 and therefore minors under 16 years of age may\nnot operate, tend, set up, adjust, clean, oil or repair such equipment (see\n29 CFR 570.33(e)). (2)  Operation of pie-dough rollers by 16- and 17-year old a.    \nThe original investigative report\nestablishing HO 11 determined that the operation of pie-dough rollers by 16-\nand 17-year-olds is safe, however, this determination applies only to those\npie-dough rollers which involve a completely automated process as used in large\nwholesale bakeries.  1.    \nThis process includes the use of a\npie-dough scaling machine which automatically cuts a predetermined portion of\npie dough and drops it into the “hopper feed” of the pie-dough roller.  The\npie-dough roller then flattens the dough and automatically rotates the dough\nthrough an arc of 90°.  The pie dough is again flattened to form the desired\nfinal shape.  The entire process eliminates any hand contact by the operator\nwith the rollers during operation.   2.    \nIf a pie-dough roller operates as\ndescribed above – in an entirely automatic process with a machine that cuts the\ndough into predetermined portions and drops it into a hopper feed or chute\nattachment that prevents an operator from making contact with any in-running\npoints of the rollers – 16- and 17-year olds may operate this equipment. 3.    \nIf the pie-dough roller does not\noperate as described above, it is prohibited by HO 11. b.    \nCertain pie-dough rolling machines\nare very similar to pizza-dough roller machines in appearance and function (see\nFOH 33h11(d)(3) for a discussion about pizza-dough rollers).  HO 11 prohibits\nthe operation of all pie-dough rollers except those described in (a) above. \nHowever, WH will not charge a violation of HO 11 regarding the employment of\n16- and 17-year-olds who operate pie-dough rollers that are constructed with\nsafeguards contained in the basic design that prevent fingers, hands, and\nclothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers; have gears\nthat are completely enclosed; and have microswitches that disengage the machinery\nif the backs or sides of the rollers are removed.  The policy applies to such\nmachinery provided that all safeguards are present on the machine, are\noperational, and have not been overridden.  This “no violation” policy does not\nextend to minors who set up, adjust, repair, oil, or clean this equipment. (3)  Application of HO 11 to dough mixers used to mix\ningredients other than dough or batter and to attachments designed for uses\nother than dough or batters. a.    \nUnder HO 11 the function of the\nagitators determines coverage of the HO.  Therefore, a dough mixer used to mix\nvegetables is covered by HO 11 if the same agitators are used as for mixing\ndough.  Agitators such as the flat beater, heavy duty wire whip, dough arm, and\nsweet dough arm are covered by HO 11 because they are designed for use with\ndough and batter.   However, if the machine is equipped with separate agitators designed\nfor use with vegetables or with icing, the functional use of the machine would\nbe different and it would not be covered. b.    \nD-Wire Whip—Occasionally,\nmanufacturers will report that some attachments are designed solely for use on\nproducts lighter than dough or batters such as whipping cream, egg whites,\nlight icings, and meringues.  This was the case with the D-Wire Whip manufactured\nby Hobart.  Field experience has documented that employers are using the\nD-Wire-Whip to mix batters and other items like cream cheese despite the\nintentions or statements of the manufacturer.  It is a violation of HO 11 for\n16- and 17-year-olds to mix batter, cream cheese, or dough using a power-driven\nbatter mixer or dough mixer, regardless of the design specifications or\nintentions of the manufacturer.  c.    \nI-Wire Whip—The I-Wire Whip\nattachment, which is used for heavier products such as cake batter and heavy\nwhipping cream, is also prohibited by HO 11 for use by 16- and 17-year-olds. d.    \nCheese Grater or Cheese/Vegetable\nSlicer Attachments 1.    \nHO 11 prohibits 16- and\n17-year-olds from placing attachments on vertical dough mixers (such as the\ncheese grater or vegetable slicer) or removing such attachments, because those\nactivities constitute the setting up and adjusting of a power-driven bakery\nmachine.    2.    \nHO 11 does not, however, prohibit\n16- and 17-year-olds from operating attachments to vertical dough mixers that\ngrate cheese or slice cheese/vegetables as long as someone at least 18 years of\nage sets up or adjusts the attachment.  This is because these attachments\nnegate the operation of the machine as a vertical dough mixer.  The machine\ncannot be used as a power-driven bakery machine (a dough mixer) when such\nattachments are being used.  However, such minors would be prohibited from\noperating any attachment to the mixer that processes meat, such as a meat\nchopper or sausage maker, because of HO 10.","html":"<p>Name:  Occupations Involved in the Operation of Bakery Machines</p><p>Originally Adopted:  July 21, 1952</p><p>(a)  \n<b>Scope of HO 11 </b></p><p>(1)  Historically, many occupational injuries occurring in\nbakeries are caused by a few specific machines.  These injuries are often\nserious, producing a disproportionate share of deaths or permanent\ndisabilities.  HO 11 was issued to prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from operating\ncertain power-driven bakery machines.  This HO is machine-specific as discussed\nin FOH 33h00.  The operation by 16- and 17-year-olds of other bakery machines\nnot specifically prohibited by the order, while not encouraged, is permitted.</p><p>(2)  This order became effective prior to the 1961 and 1966\nFLSA amendments which brought many previously uncovered retail bakeries and\nstores under the CL provisions.  Some machines prohibited by HO 11 are found in\nretail bakeries, pizzerias, restaurants and other food service establishments –\nothers are only found in wholesale bakeries.  Violations often occur in small\nbakeries where there is little division of labor and most jobs are performed by\nall employees.  </p><p>(3)  The scope of this order includes, among other\nactivities, operating, assisting to operate and cleaning the named machines\nwherever found in a covered establishment.  Manually operated (not\npower-driven) machines are outside the scope of HO 11.  Assisting to operate\nthe named machines includes the loading of ingredients into the machines – such\nas the placing of flour into a mixer – even when the machines are “turned off”\nwhen the loading is performed.  </p><p>(4)  HO 11 was revised in the 2010 Final Rule to include\ntwo exceptions related to certain lightweight, counter-top food mixers and\ncertain pizza-dough rollers (see FOH 33h11(d)(2) and (d)(3)).</p><p>(b)  \n<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>Sixteen- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from operating, assisting to\noperate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning the following\npower-driven bakery machines:</p><p>(1)  Horizontal dough mixer—a horizontal cylinder with a\nhorizontal shaft with mixing arms; revolves to mix the flour with water, yeast,\nsalt, etc. to make dough.  This prohibition includes operating a dough\nauger/feeder used to process masa for tortillas or tamales.  </p><p>(2)  Vertical dough mixer—a large bowl in which a vertical\nspindle with paddles attached mixes flour, water, etc. to make dough (often\nused in small bakery and some pizzerias).  </p><p>(3)  Batter mixer—very similar to vertical dough mixer,\nexcept different shaped paddles are used; often used for making cake batter. \nPower-driven “wands” used to mix items such as batters are also prohibited.</p><p>(4)  Bread and/or roll dividing, rounding, or molding\nmachines—in the past, separate machines performed the operation of dividing,\nrounding, and molding of dough for bread and rolls.  More modern machines are\nmultifunctional and may perform two or all three of these operations.  The\nprocess involves cutting dough into lumps (for one loaf or batch of rolls),\nrolling each lump into a ball, and after “proofing”, forming a loaf or a batch\nof rolls.  The operation is often continuous, dough being carried from one\nmachine to another by conveyor.</p><p>(5)  Dough brake—a machine which rolls dough into sheets.</p><p>(6)  Dough sheeter—a machine which rolls dough into very\nthin sheets.  This prohibition includes pizza dough rollers and tortilla\nroller/molders (also called moulders); but see special exception for operators\nof pizza dough rollers discussed in FOH 33h11(d)(3).</p><p>(7)  Combination bread-slicing and wrapping machine—a\nmachine that slices a loaf of bread and wraps it in a continuous process\n(generally only found in large, wholesale type bakeries).</p><p>(8)  Cake cutting band saw—a machine for cutting baked\ncakes into squares or rectangles.</p><p>(9)  Cookie and cracker machine—combination machines which\nform cookies or crackers from dough.  The operation is continuous, dough\nentering at one end and complete cookies or crackers, ready for baking,\nemerging at the other end.  Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may serve on a cookie and\ncracker machine crew which actually operates the machine while producing\ncookies or crackers.  These minors, however, may not set up or adjust these\nmachines (see FOH 33h11(c)(7)).</p><p>(c)  \n<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED</b></p><p>There are a number of occupations involving the operation of\npower-driven machines in industrial and retail bakeries that are permitted for\n16-and 17-year-old minors, including the following: </p><p>(1)  Ingredient preparation and mixing—flour-sifting\nmachine operator, flour-blending machine operator and sack-cleaning machine\noperator.</p><p>(2)  Product forming and shaping—batter-sealing machine\noperator, depositing machine operator, cookie or cracker machine crew member\n(but not involving the setting up or adjusting of the machine), wafer machine\noperator, pretzel-stick machine operator, pie-dough sealing machine operator,\npie-dough rolling machine operator, pie-crimping machine operator, and wedge\npress operator.  </p><p>a.    \nA wedge press is a machine that\nuses two plates, often one of which is heated, to press balls of dough into the\ndesired shape.  Such presses are often used to shape tortillas.</p><p>b.    \nBecause the original study that\nled to HO 11 did not address such presses which do not utilize “rollers,” and\nsubsequent rulemaking did not expand the scope of the HO in this respect, HO 11\ndoes not prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from operating such machines.</p><p>(3)  Finishing and Icing—depositing machine operator,\nenrobing machine operator, spray machine operator, icing mixing machine\noperator.</p><p>(4)  Slicing and Wrapping –roll slicing and wrapping\nmachine operator, cake wrapping machine operator, carton packing and sealing\nmachine operator. </p><p>(5)  Pan washing—spray-type pan washing machine operator,\ntumbler-type pan washing machine operator.</p><p>(6)  Donut and pastry filling—donut and pastry filling\nmachines, including Homogenette and similar machines which automatically inject\nfillings into donuts and pastries. </p><p>(7)  Cookie or Cracker Machine Crew Member—Sixteen- and\n17-year-olds may work on a crew operating a cookie or cracker machine.  These\nmachines, found in some wholesale bakeries, usually require crews of two to six\npersons.  But minors may not perform work involving the setting up or adjusting\nof the cookie or cracker machine.  These tasks, more hazardous than the\noperation of the machine during production, are usually performed by the crew\nchief (see FOH 33h11(b)(9)).</p><p>(8)  Bread slicing—Sixteen- and 17-year-old bakery or deli\nclerks may operate bread slicing and roll slicing machines of the type usually\nfound in retail bakeries.</p><p>(9)  Cleaning individual parts of power-driven bakery\nmachines  </p><p>a.    \nHO 11 prohibits minors under 18\nyears of age from cleaning power-driven bakery machines, but this prohibition\ndoes not apply to the cleaning of the individual parts of such machines.  Only\nemployees over 18 years of age may dismantle or reassemble such machines.  </p><p>b.    \n29 CFR  570.33(e) prohibits the\nemployment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations which involve operating,\ntending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing power-driven\nfood mixers.  Such minors may, however, clean the disassembled parts of such\nmachines.  </p><p>(d)  \n<b>Exemptions </b></p><p>(1)  There are no provisions in HO 11 for apprentices or\nstudent-learners.  There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.  </p><p>(2)  Application of HO 11 to lightweight, small capacity,\ncounter-top food mixers.</p><p>a.    \nSection 570.62(b)(1), effective\nJuly 19, 2010, provides an exception that allows 17- and 18-year-olds to\noperate, set up, adjust, repair, oil and clean lightweight, small capacity,\nportable counter-top power-driven food mixers that are, or comparable to,\nmodels intended for household use.</p><p>b.    \nFor purposes of this exemption, a\nlightweight, small capacity mixer is one that is not hardwired into the\nestablishment’s power source, is equipped with a motor that operates at no more\nthan ½ horsepower, and is equipped with a bowl with a capacity of no more than\nfive quarts.</p><p>c.    \nThis exemption shall not apply\nwhen the mixer is used, with or without attachments, to process meat or poultry\nproducts as prohibited by 29 CFR 570.61(a)(4).</p><p>d.    \nThis exemption does not extend to\nthe employment of 14- and 15-year-old workers.  Minors under 16 years of age\nare prohibited from operating or tending power-driven machinery, including\nmixers, by CL Reg 3 (see 29 CFR 570.33(e)).  That regulation\nprohibits such minors from operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning,\noiling, or repairing food mixers.</p><p>e.    \nWH has determined that the\nfollowing mixers are the type that would normally fall within this limited\nexemption contained at 29 CFR 570.62(b)(1).</p><p>f.     \nThe K-Tec Batter Mixer Model LJS\ndeveloped for the Long John Silvers quick service restaurant chain.  The Model\nLJS weighs about 8 pounds, is 11 inches in height, has a 3-quart capacity, and\noperates at 1/16 horsepower. </p><p>g.    \nThe Kitchen Aide counter top mixer\nModel K5SSWH, which is available for home use, weighs 29 pounds, is 16.4 inches\nin height, has a 5 quart capacity, and operates at 6/15 horsepower.  </p><p>(3)  Application of HO 11 to certain power-driven\npizza-dough rollers</p><p>a.    \nPizza-dough rollers, a type of\ndough sheeter, are normally prohibited under HO 11.  But § 570.62(b)(2)\ncontains an exception that permits the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to\noperate certain pizza-dough rollers that meet the following conditions:</p><p>1.    \nThey are constructed with\nsafeguards contained in the basic design so as to prevent fingers, hands, or\nclothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers, </p><p>2.    \nThey have gears that are\ncompletely enclosed, and </p><p>3.    \nThey have microswitches that\ndisengage the machinery if the backs or sides of the rollers are removed.  </p><p>b.    \nThis exception applies only when\nall the safeguards in 1. through 3. above are present on the machine, are\noperational, and have not been overridden.  </p><p>c.    \nThe policy described in (a) above\ndoes not extend to minors who set up, adjust, repair, oil or clean the assembled\nmachine.  </p><p>(e)  \n<b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  Operation and cleaning of power-driven bagel slicers</p><p>a.    \nBagel slicers which operate as\nelectric knives  </p><p>Sixteen- and 17-year-old employees may operate and clean power-driven\nbagel slicers, such as the Edgecraft Chef’s Choice Bagel Pro Bagel Slicer,\nwhich have two blades mounted next to each other running in opposing\ndirections. </p><p>b.    \nBagel slicers with circular cutting\nblades </p><p>1.    \nSome power-driven bagel slicers,\nlike the Oliver Products Bagel and Bun Slicer (Model 702) meet the definition\nof a circular saw under HO 14.  These machines saw bagels in half by means of a\nthin steel disc, having a continuous series of notches or teeth on the\nperiphery, mounted on shafting.  Although HO 11 does not address such bagel\nslicers, HO 14 would normally prohibit employees under 18 years of age from\noperating, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning such machines.</p><p>2.    \nAt the request of WH, the National\nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has examined the operation\nof these machines and has advised WH that employees 16 and 17 years of age who\noperate and clean such slicers (with circular blades and enclosed feed chutes)\nare exposed to low safety risks.  NIOSH cited the machine’s adjustable guard\nand the manufacturer’s warning sign as important contributors to this low\ndegree of risk.</p><p>3.    \nWH will not assert a violation of\nHO 14 when 16- and 17-year-old employees operate a power-driven bagel slicer\nwith a circular blade and enclosed feed chute when the machine is equipped with\nan adjustable guard that covers the feed chute and the manufacturer’s warning\nsign is affixed to the machine.  WH will not assert a violation of HO 14 when\n16- and 17-year-old employees clean such machines.  Such minors, however,\ncontinue to be prohibited from setting up, adjusting, repairing, or oiling such\nmachines.</p><p>c.    \nAll power-driven bagel slicers are\n“food slicers” under CL Reg 3 and therefore minors under 16 years of age may\nnot operate, tend, set up, adjust, clean, oil or repair such equipment (see\n29 CFR 570.33(e)).</p><p>(2)  Operation of pie-dough rollers by 16- and 17-year old</p><p>a.    \nThe original investigative report\nestablishing HO 11 determined that the operation of pie-dough rollers by 16-\nand 17-year-olds is safe, however, this determination applies only to those\npie-dough rollers which involve a completely automated process as used in large\nwholesale bakeries. </p><p>1.    \nThis process includes the use of a\npie-dough scaling machine which automatically cuts a predetermined portion of\npie dough and drops it into the “hopper feed” of the pie-dough roller.  The\npie-dough roller then flattens the dough and automatically rotates the dough\nthrough an arc of 90°.  The pie dough is again flattened to form the desired\nfinal shape.  The entire process eliminates any hand contact by the operator\nwith the rollers during operation.  </p><p>2.    \nIf a pie-dough roller operates as\ndescribed above – in an entirely automatic process with a machine that cuts the\ndough into predetermined portions and drops it into a hopper feed or chute\nattachment that prevents an operator from making contact with any in-running\npoints of the rollers – 16- and 17-year olds may operate this equipment.</p><p>3.    \nIf the pie-dough roller does not\noperate as described above, it is prohibited by HO 11.</p><p>b.    \nCertain pie-dough rolling machines\nare very similar to pizza-dough roller machines in appearance and function (see\nFOH 33h11(d)(3) for a discussion about pizza-dough rollers).  HO 11 prohibits\nthe operation of all pie-dough rollers except those described in (a) above. \nHowever, WH will not charge a violation of HO 11 regarding the employment of\n16- and 17-year-olds who operate pie-dough rollers that are constructed with\nsafeguards contained in the basic design that prevent fingers, hands, and\nclothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers; have gears\nthat are completely enclosed; and have microswitches that disengage the machinery\nif the backs or sides of the rollers are removed.  The policy applies to such\nmachinery provided that all safeguards are present on the machine, are\noperational, and have not been overridden.  This “no violation” policy does not\nextend to minors who set up, adjust, repair, oil, or clean this equipment.</p><p>(3)  Application of HO 11 to dough mixers used to mix\ningredients other than dough or batter and to attachments designed for uses\nother than dough or batters.</p><p>a.    \nUnder HO 11 the function of the\nagitators determines coverage of the HO.  Therefore, a dough mixer used to mix\nvegetables is covered by HO 11 if the same agitators are used as for mixing\ndough.  Agitators such as the flat beater, heavy duty wire whip, dough arm, and\nsweet dough arm are covered by HO 11 because they are designed for use with\ndough and batter.  </p><p>However, if the machine is equipped with separate agitators designed\nfor use with vegetables or with icing, the functional use of the machine would\nbe different and it would not be covered.</p><p>b.    \nD-Wire Whip—Occasionally,\nmanufacturers will report that some attachments are designed solely for use on\nproducts lighter than dough or batters such as whipping cream, egg whites,\nlight icings, and meringues.  This was the case with the D-Wire Whip manufactured\nby Hobart.  Field experience has documented that employers are using the\nD-Wire-Whip to mix batters and other items like cream cheese despite the\nintentions or statements of the manufacturer.  It is a violation of HO 11 for\n16- and 17-year-olds to mix batter, cream cheese, or dough using a power-driven\nbatter mixer or dough mixer, regardless of the design specifications or\nintentions of the manufacturer. </p><p>c.    \nI-Wire Whip—The I-Wire Whip\nattachment, which is used for heavier products such as cake batter and heavy\nwhipping cream, is also prohibited by HO

Machines.","text":"Name:  Occupations involved in the operation of balers, compactors, and\npaper-products machines  Originally Adopted:  September 11, 1954 (a)  \nScope of HO 12 (1)  HO 12 was issued in response to the finding that the\npaper-products industry experienced a somewhat higher general frequency of\ninjury rate than all manufacturing industries as a whole, and a somewhat higher\nfrequency of the more serious types of injuries and of deaths.  The\nprohibitions regarding scrap paper balers were established to combat the\ndangers of being caught in the plungers during the compression process and\nsuffering strains and other injuries while moving the compressed bales. (2)  HO 12 prohibits those under 18 years of age from\noperating and assisting to operate certain power-driven machines used in the\nmanufacture or conversion of paper or pulp into a finished product or in the\npreparation of such products for recycling or disposal.  The HO applies\nwherever the machines are located when operated by a covered employee. (3)  HO 12 was revised effective February 14, 2005 (see\n69 FR 75393, December 16, 2004, for more information).  The major revisions\nincluded: a.    \nIncorporating the provisions of\nthe Compactors and Balers Safety Standards Modernization Act (August 6, 1996)\nwhich created FLSA § 13(c)(5).  This section, among other things, prohibits\nminors under 18 years of age from operating and unloading balers and compactor,\nand permits 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not operate or unload, certain\nbalers and compactors under specific conditions. b.    \nExpanding the prohibitions of the\nHO to include balers and compactors that process other materials in addition to\npaper.  Prior to February 14, 2005, only balers and compactors that processed\npaper products exclusively fell under the prohibitions of HO 12 (see\nFOH 3312(b)(1)a for information regarding the impact of this revision). (4)  HO 12 was again revised by a Final Rule, effective\nJuly 19, 2010.  That revision brought all power-driven compactors and balers,\nregardless of the materials being processed, under the prohibitions of HO 12. \nThe revision also clarified that the limited exemption contained in FLSA §\n13(c)(5) that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not operate or unload,\ncertain equipment applies only to scrap paper balers and paper box compactors. \n (5)  Definitions a.    \nThe term operating or assisting to\noperate means all work that involves starting or stopping a machine covered by\nthis section, placing materials into or removing materials from a machine,\nincluding clearing a machine of jammed materials, paper, or cardboard, or any\nother work directly involved in operating the machine.  The term does not\ninclude the stacking of materials by an employee in an area nearby or adjacent\nto the machine where such employee does not place the materials into the\nmachine. b.    \nThe term paper products machine\nshall mean all power-driven machines used in: 1.    \nthe remanufacture or conversion of\npaper or pulp into a finished product, including preparation of materials for\nrecycling, or 2.    \nThe preparation of such materials\nfor disposal—whether the machines are used in establishments that manufacture\nconverted paper or pulp products or in any other type of establishment. c.    \nCompactors 1.    \nThe term paper box compactor means\na powered machine that remains stationary during operation, used to compact\nrefuse, including paper boxes, into a detachable or integral container or into\na transfer vehicle. 2.    \nThe term compactor that is\ndesigned or used to process materials other than paper means a powered machine\nthat remains stationary during operation, designed or used to compact refuse\nother than paper or cardboard boxes into a detachable or integral container or\ninto a transfer vehicle. d.    \nBalers 1.    \nThe term scrap paper baler means a\npowered machine used to compress paper and possibly other solid waste, with or\nwithout binding, to a density or form that will support handling and\ntransportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable\ncontainer.  2.    \nThe term baler that is designed or\nused to process materials other than paper means a powered machine designed or\nused to compress materials other than paper and cardboard boxes, with or\nwithout binding, to a density or form that will support handling and\ntransportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable\ncontainer. e.    \nThe term Applicable American\nNational Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard means one of the standards listed\nin the chart contained in FOH 33h11(d)(2)a1  The ANSI standard for scrap\npaper balers and paper box compactors govern the manufacturing and modification\nof the equipment, the operation and maintenance of the equipment, and employee\ntraining.  The Secretary of Labor may add more recent standards to the chart\nupon finding that the newer standards are as protective of the safety of minors\nas those already on the list. (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED (1)  HO 12 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from operating,\nassisting to operate, setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning the\nfollowing power-driven paper products machines, including those which do not\ninvolve hand feeding, as well as balers and compactors: a.    \nAll balers and compactors,\nregardless of the materials being processed.  This prohibition includes equipment\ndesigned to process only paper, equipment designed to process materials other\nthan paper, and equipment that can process both paper and other materials. 1.    \nHO 12 was revised effective\nFebruary 14, 2005, to expand the prohibitions of the HO to include balers and\ncompactors that process other materials in addition to paper.  Prior to\nFebruary 14, 2005, only those balers and compactors that processed paper\nproducts exclusively (no other materials placed in the machine) fell under the\nprohibitions of HO 12. 2.    \nHO 12 was again revised, effective\nJuly 19, 2010 to prohibit youth under 18 years of age from operating, assisting\nto operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning all\ncompactors and balers, regardless of the materials being processed.     3.    \nOther materials which are\nprocessed by scrap paper balers and paper box compactors include, but are not\nlimited to, plastics, rubber, food waste, foam rubber and aluminum cans.  The\nrisks which these machines present to minor employees remain the same,\nregardless of the materials being processed.   b.    \nArm type wire stitcher or\nstapler—a power-driven machine, operated by a foot treadle, which stitches\ncartons together.  The carton is held by the operator during the operation. \nMay be single action or it may operate continuously. c.    \nCircular or band saw—similar to\nand operating the same as wood-working saws, used for sawing fiber or\ncorrugated paper stock.  It is hand fed. d.    \nCorner cutter or mitering\nmachine—a type of punch press used for cutting away corners for set-up box\nblanks.  May be horizontal or vertical, cutting one corner (single) or two\ncorners (double) at a time.  It is hand fed, treadle operated, operating\ncontinuously when pedal is depressed. e.    \nCorrugating and single- or\ndouble-facing machine—a large machine which combines plain paperboard (liners)\nwith corrugated paper (filler) to form corrugated paperboard.  Single facing\nmeans a liner on one side; double facing means liners on both sides.  Machine\nconsists of a series of rolls which corrugates the center and glues the facing\nto it.  Operating continuously from rolls of paper stock cutting to size as the\nlast operation. f.     \nEnvelope die-cutting press—a\nmachine for cutting envelope blank.  A die is placed by hand on a stack of\npaper and a plunger forces the die through the paper.  May be single acting or\ncontinuous in operation. g.    \nGuillotine paper cutter or shear—a\nmachine consisting of a heavy knife blade held vertically by the headwork of\nthe machine used for cutting flat paper stock.  Paper is placed on the bed of\nthe machine by hand and the machine operated by a foot treadle, hand lever, or\ntwo-handed tripping device.  Machine is single action, making one stroke at a\ntime. h.    \nHorizontal bar scorer—a little\nused machine for scoring (cutting part-way through) heavy fiber stock.  A die\nis supported by a head frame and when operated, descends into the fiber.  The\nmachine is foot operated and hand fed. i.     \nLaminating or combining machine—a\nmachine for gluing together two or more piles of paper to make a fiberboard. \nOperates in same manner as corrugating and single- or double-facing machine. j.     \nSheeting machine—a machine for\ncutting sheets of paper from a roll of paper.  Knives, mounted on revolving\narms, cut the paper as it goes through the machine.  It operates continuously,\nthe operator threading the paper through the machine and taking away the cut\nsheets.  k.    \nVertical slotter—a machine for\ncutting slots in fiber or box board stock by means of a die which descends when\nthe machine is operated.  It is hand fed, foot or hand operated.  The eccentric\ntype employs a toothed die, actuated by a horizontal eccentric-revolving\nshaft.  It operates continuously and is hand fed. (2)  HO 12 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from operating\nplaten die-cutting presses, platen printing presses, and punch presses which\ninvolve hand feeding of the machines.  It also prohibits these minors from\nsetting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning these types of machines. a.    \nplaten die-cutting press—a machine\nfor cutting paper stock by means of a die mounted on the frame of the press\n(the chase).  Paper is placed on the platen which swings up against the die. \nIt operates continuously. b.    \nplaten printing press—a machine\nsimilar to a platen die-cutting press, except that type for printing is mounted\nin the chase, instead of a die. c.    \npunch press—a machine for cutting\nout paper stock by means of a die, mounted on a plunger, which descends when\nthe press is operated.  May be operated by foot treadle, lever, or two-handed\ntripping device.  May be single acting or continuous. (c)  \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED (1)  There are many machines used in the paper-products\nindustries which are not covered by this HO.  The most important of these\nmachines are the following: \n\n\n \n  \n  Bag machine, bag-making machine\n  \n  \n  Lacer machine\n  \n \n \n  \n  Bottoming machine (bags)\n  \n  \n  Parchmenting, waxing, or coating machines\n  \n \n \n  \n  Box-making machine (collapsible boxes)\n  \n  \n  Partition assembling machine\n  \n \n \n  \n  Bundling machine\n  \n  \n  Quadruple stayer\n  \n \n \n  \n  Calendar roll and plating machine\n  \n  \n  Rewinder\n  \n \n \n  \n  Cigarette carton opener and tax stamping machine\n  \n  \n  Rotary

\n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  Jogging machine\n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n\n\n (2)  HO 12 does not apply to machines which exclusively\nprocess leather or any substances other than paper or paper products (other\nthan balers and compactors discussed below). (d)  \nExemptions (1)  HO 12 contains an exemption for student-learners and\napprentices. (2)  Loading of certain scrap paper balers and paper box\ncompactors. a.    \nPublic Law 104-174, signed August\n6, 1996, amends § 13(c) of the FLSA to permit minors 16 and 17 years of age to\nload (but not operate or unload) certain scrap paper balers and paper box\ncompactors if all of the requirements listed below are met.  This exemption\ncovers only the loading of such equipment, and only scrap paper balers and\npaper box compactors.  No youth under 18 years of age may load any other type\nof compactor or baler.  HO 12 (§ 570.63) reflects this statutory language. 1.    \nThe employer must ensure that the\nequipment meets, and continues to meet, one of the American National Standards\nInstitute’s (ANSI) Standards listed in the chart below.  One column of\nstandards is specific to scrap paper balers and the other is specific to for\npaper box compactors. \n\n\n \n  \n  In order for employers to take advantage of the limited exception\n  discussed in FOH 33h12(d) , the scrap paper baler must meet one of the\n  following ANSI Standards:\n  \n  \n  In order for employers to take advantage of the limited exception\n  discussed in this FOH 33h12(d), the paper box compactor must meet one of the\n  following ANSI Standards:\n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  ANSI Standard Z245.5-1990\n  \n  \n  ANSI Standard Z245.2-1992\n  \n \n \n  \n  ANSI Standard Z245.5-1997\n  \n  \n  ANSI Standard Z245.2-1997\n  \n \n \n  \n  ANSI Standard Z245.5-2004\n  \n  \n  ANSI Standard Z245.2-2004\n  \n \n \n  \n  ANSI Standard Z245.5-2008\n  \n  \n  ANSI Standard Z245.2-2008\n  \n \n\n\n 2.    \nThe ANSI standards are industry\nstandards which govern the design, manufacture, operation and maintenance of\nthe equipment. 3.    \nThe FLSA does permit the Secretary\nto adopt any newer ANSI standards under HO 12 once it is determined that they\nare at least as protective of the safety of minors as the standards listed\nabove.   4.    \nThe employer must provide notice\nand post a notice on each piece of equipment stating that the equipment meets\nthe appropriate ANSI standard named above; that 16- and 17-year-olds may only\nload the equipment; and that any employee under 18 may not operate or unload\nsuch equipment. A.   \nWH has determined that “posting” a\nprominent and easily visible notice will also satisfy the requirement that\nnotice be “provided” (see 29 CFR 570.63(c)(1)(iv)). B.   \nThere is no one format that the\nnotice must follow to satisfy the posting requirement, but WH believes that the\nintent of FLSA § 13(c)(5) will be satisfied if each notice:  i.     \nContains an accurate statement\nthat the baler or compactor to be loaded by the minor meets the applicable ANSI\nstandard named in § 13(c)(5)(B)(i)(I) of the FLSA or meets a more recent ANSI\nstandard which the Secretary has certified to be at least as protective of the\nsafety of minors as the standard described in FLSA § 13(c)(5)(B)(i)(I);\nand ii.    \nCites the specific ANSI standard,\nincluding the year of issuance, that the employer is providing notice that the\nequipment meets; and iii.  \nIncludes a clear statement that 16-\nand 17-year-olds may only load the scrap paper balers and paper box compactors;\nand,  iv.  \nIncludes a clear statement that no\nemployee under the age of 18 may operate or unload the scrap paper balers and\npaper box compactors.   C.   \nWH has been advised that industry\nassociations such as the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) and the National\nGrocers Association (NGA) have developed and marketed to their members\n“notices” or “stickers” believing that such notices or stickers comport with\nthe requirements of FLSA § 13(c)(5). i.     \nWH has examined the sample notices\nor stickers created by both the NGA and the FMI and, as discussed in the\npreamble to the final rule that became effective on February 14, 2005, noted\nthat these stickers do not satisfy the posting requirements of FLSA § 13(c)(5)\n(see 69 FR 75394, December 16, 2004).  The stickers do not clearly\nidentify the applicable ANSI standard as required.  ANSI includes, in the\ncaption or title of each of its standards, both a “series identifier” and a\nyear of issuance, so as to eliminate confusion between different editions of\nstandards that apply to the same type of machinery.   ii.    \nWH will consider the NGA and FMI\nstickers to constitute acceptable notices if they are modified to state\nexplicitly the full caption of the ANSI standard (both the series identifier\nand the year of issuance).  This modification may, of course, be made by\nprinting all future stickers with the full, accurate information as to the\nspecific applicable standard.  But existing stickers may also be modified by\nmaking hand-written insertions of the additional information that is necessary\nto identify the specific standard.  Such insertions must be written legibly, in\nindelible ink, and in the same size of lettering as the ANSI standard\nidentifiers already printed on the sticker. iii.  \nThe NGA and the FMI have also\ndeveloped stickers to be placed on equipment that does not meet the\nrequirements of the limited exemption contained in FLSA § 13(c)(5) and,\ntherefore, cannot be loaded, operated or unloaded by any employee who is less\nthan 18 years of age.  These stickers, which are not required by the Act and\nthe use of which is completely voluntary, alert employees that they may not\nload, operate or unload the equipment unless they are 18 years of age or\nolder.   D.   \nCommunity-owned or -operated\nbalers and compactors  In certain situations, such as at a shopping mall,\nindustrial park, office building, or military base, multiple employers may have\naccess to and use community balers and compactors that the facilities manager\nor owner has made available to the tenants or contractors. i.     \nIn these situations, it is not\nnecessary for every employer (tenant) to post a notice as required by FLSA §\n13(c)(5).  The facilities manager or owner, or the owner of the equipment, may\nmake the necessary postings and satisfy each employer's (tenant's) posting\nobligations under the exception. ii.    \nBut, should the notice not be\naccurate or complete—i.e., the baler or compactor fails to meet the appropriate\nANSI standard, or the notice fails to fully identify the appropriate ANSI\nstandard—the burden of compliance remains with the employer (tenant) of any\nyouth who loaded the equipment.  An incomplete or inaccurate posting by the\nfacilities manager or owner will not relieve a tenant from being charged with a\nviolation of HO 12.    75 FR 28440-41 (May 20, 2010) iii.  \nEmployers cannot delegate their\nresponsibilities for compliance by relying on the accuracy of notices posted by\nothers. 5.    \nThe equipment must include an\non-off switch incorporating a key-lock or other system, and the control of the\nsystem is maintained in the custody of employees who are at least 18 years of\nage.  The “other system” may be a numerical touch pad but the passcode may not\nbe shared with employees under the age of 18 years. 6.    \nThe on-off switch of the equipment\nmust be maintained in an off position when the equipment is not in operation. 7.    \nThe equipment cannot be operated\nwhile it is being loaded. b.    \nThe language and legislative\nhistory of the amendment make it clear that it is the responsibility of the\nemployer to make the initial determination that the equipment to be loaded by\n16- and 17-year-olds meets the appropriate ANSI standards.  It is also the\nemployer’s responsibility to provide the notice and post it on each piece of\nequipment which is loaded by 16- and 17-year-olds.  For enforcement purposes,\nthe posting of the notice will also satisfy the requirement that notice be\nprovided. c.    \nLoading of scrap paper balers and\npaper box compactors not only encompasses the placing of materials into the\nmachines, but also includes placing materials into chutes that, by gravity,\nfeed the materials to the machines.  Loading also includes placing materials\nonto conveyors that, by power or gravity, then feed the materials into the\nbalers or compactors. (e)  \nEnforcement positions (1)  Laminators and packaging machines a.    \nThe type of laminators prohibited\nby HO 12 are those used to laminate or combine two or more sheets of paper or\ncardboard to form a multiple-ply product by applying an adhesive and running\nthe paper through various pressure rolls.   b.    \nLaminators, such as the GBC Pouch\nLaminator, which are designed to encase a document such as an identification\ncard between two pieces of plastic by using heat in a simple process, are not\nsubject to HO 12.  c.    \nMachines designed to enclose and\nseal products (i.e., pills and capsules) in packaging consisting primarily of\nplastic or foil and some cardboard or paperboard, are not within the scope of\nHO 12.  Names for this type of machine include dry mounting/laminating press;\njumbo sealer; and the euclid cadet or cadet twin unit dose strip packaging\nmachine. (2)  Silk Screen printing press This equipment, when\ndesigned to function in the same manner as the platen printing press, is\nprohibited for use by persons under the age of 18. (3)  Three spindle paper drill (Challenge Model EH-3A for\nexample) This equipment, used\nfor die-cutting or embossing operations, operates in the same manner as a hand\nfed punch press.  Minors under 18 years of age are prohibited from operating\nthis equipment.  (4)  Kansmacker The kansmacker is a\npower-driven machine that sorts, counts and flattens beverage cans.  It is not\ncovered by HO 12. (5)  Decollators and bursters A decollator is a\nmachine which separates stacks of multi-part paper into individual stacks (for\neach copy) while removing the carbon paper.  It is often capable of trimming\nthe pin-feed holes from one or both sides.  A burster is a machine that takes\ncontinuous single copy and bursts it into individual sheets or pages.  These\nmachines do not come within the definition of paper products machines and are\nnot covered under HO 12. (6)  Cylinder press HO 12 does not\nprohibit the operation of a cylinder press.  Such machines are considered much\nless hazardous than platen presses, where feeding takes place at the point of\noperation.  (7)  Paper shredders  The operation of paper\nshredders is not prohibited by HO 12.  In addition, paper shredders of the type\nnormally used in offices may be operated by minors 14 and 15 years of age. (8)  Stitcher-trimmer machine a.    \nA stitcher-trimmer machine\nautomatically collates, stitches (inserts wire staples), and trims such things\nas pamphlets, periodicals, and other paper products.  WHD has examined\nstitcher-trimmer machines and has determined that HO 12 does not prohibit minors\nfrom operating those stitcher-trimmer machines that do not use a guillotine\npaper cutter or shear to trim the product.  This machine is not to be confused\nwith an arm-type wire stitcher or stapler – a power-driven machine\nprohibited by HO 12, operated by a foot treadle, and used to stitch or staple\ncartons together (see FOH 33h12(b)(1)b).     b.    \nHO 12 does prohibit youth under 18\nyears of age from operating those stitcher-trimmers that use a guillotine paper\ncutter or shear to trim the product.  Such prohibited equipment includes the STAHL\nST-90 and the Stitchmaster ST-100, both manufactured by\nHeidelberg.   (9)  LiftPak compactor a.    \nThe LiftPak Compactor Model 1000,\nmanufactured by LiftPak, L.C., is an indoor compactor that processes material,\nincluding paper products, by use of a ram.  This equipment is often used by\nquick service restaurants.  When it is time to unload the machine, a built-in\ncart containing the compacted waste is detached from the machine and manually\nwheeled to the dumpster.  The operator then pushes a button on the cart and an\nelectric lift raises the compacted refuse to the height of the dumpster.  After\nthe lift tray is released, the refuse is allowed to fall into the dumpster by\ngravity.  The operator then lowers the lift and wheels the cart back to the\nmain machine for reattaching.  b.    \nBecause the LiftPak Compactor\nModel 1000 is a compactor that processes materials such as food waste and\nplastic in addition to paper products, youth under 18 years of age are\nprohibited from operating and unloading such equipment (as of February 14,\n2005)—and may only load such equipment if they meet the requirements of the\nexemption contained in HO 12 (see 29 CFR 570.63(c) and\nFOH 33h12(d)(2)).  The prohibition on unloading includes all the\nactivities associated with depositing the compacted refuse into the dumpster,\nincluding returning and reattaching the built-in cart to the equipment. c.    \nWH learned that LiftPak, L.C. has\nmarketed the Model 1000 as a compactor that “employees don’t have to be 18 to\noperate…” and has stated on its Webpage that the Department of Labor has\napproved the equipment for use by employees 16 and older.  Although such\nadvertisements may have been proper prior to the publication of the Final Rule\nthat modified HO 12 effective February 14, 2005, this information is no longer\ncorrect.   d.    \nThe electric lift that raises the\ndetached compaction compartment to the height of the dumpster during the\nunloading process cannot be considered a hoisting apparatus prohibited under HO\n7.  But as mentioned in (b) above, the detaching, emptying, and reattaching of\nthe container containing the waste is prohibited as “unloading” under HO 12.","html":"<p>Name:  Occupations involved in the operation of balers, compactors,

revision also clarified that the limited exemption contained in FLSA §\n13(c)(5) that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not operate or unload,\ncertain equipment applies only to scrap paper balers and paper box compactors. \n</p><p>(5)  Definitions</p><p>a.    \nThe term operating or assisting to\noperate means all work that involves starting or stopping a machine covered by\nthis section, placing materials into or removing materials from a machine,\nincluding clearing a machine of jammed materials, paper, or cardboard, or any\nother work directly involved in operating the machine.  The term does not\ninclude the stacking of materials by an employee in an area nearby or adjacent\nto the machine where such employee does not place the materials into the\nmachine.</p><p>b.    \nThe term paper products machine\nshall mean all power-driven machines used in:</p><p>1.    \nthe remanufacture or conversion of\npaper or pulp into a finished product, including preparation of materials for\nrecycling, or</p><p>2.    \nThe preparation of such materials\nfor disposal—whether the machines are used in establishments that manufacture\nconverted paper or pulp products or in any other type of establishment.</p><p>c.    \nCompactors</p><p>1.    \nThe term paper box compactor means\na powered machine that remains stationary during operation, used to compact\nrefuse, including paper boxes, into a detachable or integral container or into\na transfer vehicle.</p><p>2.    \nThe term compactor that is\ndesigned or used to process materials other than paper means a powered machine\nthat remains stationary during operation, designed or used to compact refuse\nother than paper or cardboard boxes into a detachable or integral container or\ninto a transfer vehicle.</p><p>d.    \nBalers</p><p>1.    \nThe term scrap paper baler means a\npowered machine used to compress paper and possibly other solid waste, with or\nwithout binding, to a density or form that will support handling and\ntransportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable\ncontainer. </p><p>2.    \nThe term baler that is designed or\nused to process materials other than paper means a powered machine designed or\nused to compress materials other than paper and cardboard boxes, with or\nwithout binding, to a density or form that will support handling and\ntransportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable\ncontainer.</p><p>e.    \nThe term Applicable American\nNational Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard means one of the standards listed\nin the chart contained in FOH 33h11(d)(2)a1  The ANSI standard for scrap\npaper balers and paper box compactors govern the manufacturing and modification\nof the equipment, the operation and maintenance of the equipment, and employee\ntraining.  The Secretary of Labor may add more recent standards to the chart\nupon finding that the newer standards are as protective of the safety of minors\nas those already on the list.</p><p>(b)  \n<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p><p>(1)  HO 12 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from operating,\nassisting to operate, setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning the\nfollowing power-driven paper products machines, including those which do not\ninvolve hand feeding, as well as balers and compactors:</p><p>a.    \nAll balers and compactors,\nregardless of the materials being processed.  This prohibition includes equipment\ndesigned to process only paper, equipment designed to process materials other\nthan paper, and equipment that can process both paper and other materials.</p><p>1.    \nHO 12 was revised effective\nFebruary 14, 2005, to expand the prohibitions of the HO to include balers and\ncompactors that process other materials in addition to paper.  Prior to\nFebruary 14, 2005, only those balers and compactors that processed paper\nproducts exclusively (no other materials placed in the machine) fell under the\nprohibitions of HO 12.</p><p>2.    \nHO 12 was again revised, effective\nJuly 19, 2010 to prohibit youth under 18 years of age from operating, assisting\nto operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning all\ncompactors and balers, regardless of the materials being processed.    </p><p>3.    \nOther materials which are\nprocessed by scrap paper balers and paper box compactors include, but are not\nlimited to, plastics, rubber, food waste, foam rubber and aluminum cans.  The\nrisks which these machines present to minor employees remain the same,\nregardless of the materials being processed.  </p><p>b.    \nArm type wire stitcher or\nstapler—a power-driven machine, operated by a foot treadle, which stitches\ncartons together.  The carton is held by the operator during the operation. \nMay be single action or it may operate continuously.</p><p>c.    \nCircular or band saw—similar to\nand operating the same as wood-working saws, used for sawing fiber or\ncorrugated paper stock.  It is hand fed.</p><p>d.    \nCorner cutter or mitering\nmachine—a type of punch press used for cutting away corners for set-up box\nblanks.  May be horizontal or vertical, cutting one corner (single) or two\ncorners (double) at a time.  It is hand fed, treadle operated, operating\ncontinuously when pedal is depressed.</p><p>e.    \nCorrugating and single- or\ndouble-facing machine—a large machine which combines plain paperboard (liners)\nwith corrugated paper (filler) to form corrugated paperboard.  Single facing\nmeans a liner on one side; double facing means liners on both sides.  Machine\nconsists of a series of rolls which corrugates the center and glues the facing\nto it.  Operating continuously from rolls of paper stock cutting to size as the\nlast operation.</p><p>f.     \nEnvelope die-cutting press—a\nmachine for cutting envelope blank.  A die is placed by hand on a stack of\npaper and a plunger forces the die through the paper.  May be single acting or\ncontinuous in operation.</p><p>g.    \nGuillotine paper cutter or shear—a\nmachine consisting of a heavy knife blade held vertically by the headwork of\nthe machine used for cutting flat paper stock.  Paper is placed on the bed of\nthe machine by hand and the machine operated by a foot treadle, hand lever, or\ntwo-handed tripping device.  Machine is single action, making one stroke at a\ntime.</p><p>h.    \nHorizontal bar scorer—a little\nused machine for scoring (cutting part-way through) heavy fiber stock.  A die\nis supported by a head frame and when operated, descends into the fiber.  The\nmachine is foot operated and hand fed.</p><p>i.     \nLaminating or combining machine—a\nmachine for gluing together two or more piles of paper to make a fiberboard. \nOperates in same manner as corrugating and single- or double-facing machine.</p><p>j.     \nSheeting machine—a machine for\ncutting sheets of paper from a roll of paper.  Knives, mounted on revolving\narms, cut the paper as it goes through the machine.  It operates continuously,\nthe operator threading the paper through the machine and taking away the cut\nsheets. </p><p>k.    \nVertical slotter—a machine for\ncutting slots in fiber or box board stock by means of a die which descends when\nthe machine is operated.  It is hand fed, foot or hand operated.  The eccentric\ntype employs a toothed die, actuated by a horizontal eccentric-revolving\nshaft.  It operates continuously and is hand fed.</p><p>(2)  HO 12 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from operating\nplaten die-cutting presses, platen printing presses, and punch presses which\ninvolve hand feeding of the machines.  It also prohibits these minors from\nsetting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning these types of machines.</p><p>a.    \nplaten die-cutting press—a machine\nfor cutting paper stock by means of a die mounted on the frame of the press\n(the chase).  Paper is placed on the platen which swings up against the die. \nIt operates continuously.</p><p>b.    \nplaten printing press—a machine\nsimilar to a platen die-cutting press, except that type for printing is mounted\nin the chase, instead of a die.</p><p>c.    \npunch press—a machine for cutting\nout paper stock by means of a die, mounted on a plunger, which descends when\nthe press is operated.  May be operated by foot treadle, lever, or two-handed\ntripping device.  May be single acting or continuous.</p><p>(c)  \n<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED</b></p><p>(1)  There are many machines used in the paper-products\nindustries which are not covered by this HO.  The most important of these\nmachines are the

12 does not apply to machines which exclusively\nprocess leather or any substances other than paper or paper products (other\nthan balers and compactors discussed below).</p><p>(d)  \n<b>Exemptions</b></p><p>(1)  HO 12 contains an exemption for student-learners and\napprentices.</p><p>(2)  Loading of certain scrap paper balers and paper box\ncompactors.</p><p>a.    \nPublic Law 104-174, signed August\n6, 1996, amends § 13(c) of the FLSA to permit minors 16 and 17 years of age to\nload (but not operate or unload) certain scrap paper balers and paper box\ncompactors if all of the requirements listed below are met.  This exemption\ncovers only the loading of such equipment, and only scrap paper balers and\npaper box compactors.  No youth under 18 years of age may load any other type\nof compactor or baler.  HO 12 (§ 570.63) reflects this statutory language.</p><p>1.    \nThe employer must ensure that the\nequipment meets, and continues to meet, one of the American National Standards\nInstitute’s (ANSI) Standards listed in the chart below.  One column of\nstandards is specific to scrap paper balers and the other is specific to for\npaper box compactors.</p><div>\n\n<table>\n <tbody><tr>\n  <td>\n  <p>In order for employers to take advantage of the limited exception\n  discussed in FOH 33h12(d) , the scrap paper baler

</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n</div><p>2.    \nThe ANSI standards are industry\nstandards which govern the design, manufacture, operation and maintenance of\nthe equipment.</p><p>3.    \nThe FLSA does permit the Secretary\nto adopt any newer ANSI standards under HO 12 once it is determined that they\nare at least as protective of the safety of minors as the standards listed\nabove.  </p><p>4.    \nThe employer must provide notice\nand post a notice on each piece of equipment stating that the equipment meets\nthe appropriate ANSI standard named above; that 16- and 17-year-olds may only\nload the equipment; and that any employee under 18 may not operate or unload\nsuch equipment.</p><p>A.   \nWH has determined that “posting” a\nprominent and easily visible notice will also satisfy the requirement that\nnotice be “provided” (see 29 CFR 570.63(c)(1)(iv)).</p><p>B.   \nThere is no one format that the\nnotice must follow to satisfy the posting requirement, but WH believes that the\nintent of FLSA § 13(c)(5) will be satisfied if each notice: </p><p>i.     \nContains an accurate statement\nthat the baler or compactor to be loaded by the minor meets the applicable ANSI\nstandard named in § 13(c)(5)(B)(i)(I) of the FLSA or meets a more recent ANSI\nstandard which the Secretary has certified to be at least as protective of the\nsafety of minors as the standard described in FLSA § 13(c)(5)(B)(i)(I);\nand</p><p>ii.    \nCites the specific ANSI standard,\nincluding the year of issuance, that the employer is providing notice that the\nequipment meets; and</p><p>iii.  \nIncludes a clear statement that 16-\nand 17-year-olds may only load the scrap paper balers and paper box compactors;\nand, </p><p>iv.  \nIncludes a clear statement that no\nemployee under the age of 18 may operate or unload the scrap paper balers and\npaper box compactors.  </p><p>C.   \nWH has been advised that industry\nassociations such as the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) and the National\nGrocers Association (NGA) have developed and marketed to their members\n“notices” or “stickers” believing that such notices or stickers comport with\nthe requirements of FLSA § 13(c)(5).</p><p>i.     \nWH has examined the sample notices\nor stickers created by both the NGA and the FMI and, as discussed in the\npreamble to the final rule that became effective on February 14, 2005, noted\nthat these stickers do not satisfy the posting requirements of FLSA § 13(c)(5)\n(see 69 FR 75394, December 16, 2004).  The stickers do not clearly\nidentify the applicable ANSI standard as required.  ANSI includes, in the\ncaption or title of each of its standards, both a “series identifier” and a\nyear of issuance, so as to eliminate confusion between different editions of\nstandards that apply to the same type of machinery.  </p><p>ii.    \nWH will consider the NGA and FMI\nstickers to constitute acceptable notices if they are modified to state\nexplicitly the full caption of the ANSI standard (both the series identifier\nand the year of issuance).  This modification may, of course, be made by\nprinting all future stickers with the full, accurate information as to the\nspecific applicable standard.  But existing stickers may also be modified by\nmaking hand-written insertions of the additional information that is necessary\nto identify the specific standard.  Such insertions must be written legibly, in\nindelible ink, and in the same size of lettering as the ANSI standard\nidentifiers already printed on the sticker.</p><p>iii.  \nThe NGA and the FMI have also\ndeveloped stickers to be placed on equipment that does not meet the\nrequirements of the limited exemption contained in FLSA § 13(c)(5) and,\ntherefore, cannot be loaded, operated or unloaded by any employee who is less\nthan 18 years of age.  These stickers, which are not required by the Act and\nthe use of which is completely voluntary, alert employees that they may not\nload, operate or unload the equipment unless they are 18 years of age or\nolder.  </p><p>D.   \nCommunity-owned or -operated\nbalers and compactors  In certain situations, such as at a shopping mall,\nindustrial park, office building, or military base, multiple employers may have\naccess to and use community balers and compactors that the facilities manager\nor owner has made available to the tenants or contractors.</p><p>i.     \nIn these situations, it is not\nnecessary for every employer (tenant) to post a notice as required by FLSA §\n13(c)(5).  The facilities manager or owner, or the owner of the equipment, may\nmake the necessary postings and satisfy each employer's (tenant's) posting\nobligations under the exception.</p><p>ii.    \nBut, should the notice not be\naccurate or complete—i.e., the baler or compactor fails to meet the appropriate\nANSI standard, or the notice fails to fully identify the appropriate ANSI\nstandard—the burden of compliance remains with the employer (tenant) of any\nyouth who loaded the equipment.  An incomplete or inaccurate posting by the\nfacilities manager or owner will not relieve a tenant from being charged with a\nviolation of HO 12.   </p><p>75 FR 28440-41 (May 20, 2010)</p><p>iii.  \nEmployers cannot delegate their\nresponsibilities for compliance by relying on the accuracy of notices posted by\nothers.</p><p>5.    \nThe equipment must include an\non-off switch incorporating a key-lock or other system, and the control of the\nsystem is maintained in the custody of employees who are at least 18 years of\nage.  The “other system” may be a numerical touch pad but the passcode may not\nbe shared with employees under the age of 18 years.</p><p>6.    \nThe on-off switch of the equipment\nmust be maintained in an off position when the equipment is not in operation.</p><p>7.    \nThe equipment cannot be operated\nwhile it is being loaded.</p><p>b.    \nThe language and legislative\nhistory of the amendment make it clear that it is the responsibility of the\nemployer to make the initial determination that the equipment to be loaded by\n16- and 17-year-olds meets the appropriate ANSI standards.  It is also the\nemployer’s responsibility to provide the notice and post it on each piece of\nequipment which is loaded by 16- and 17-year-olds.  For enforcement purposes,\nthe posting of the notice will also satisfy the requirement that notice be\nprovided.</p><p>c.    \nLoading of scrap paper balers and\npaper box compactors not only encompasses the placing of materials into the\nmachines, but also includes placing materials into chutes that, by gravity,\nfeed the materials to the machines.  Loading also includes placing materials\nonto conveyors that, by power or gravity, then feed the materials into the\nbalers or compactors.</p><p>(e)  \n<b>Enforcement positions</b></p><p>(1)  Laminators and packaging machines</p><p>a.    \nThe type of laminators prohibited\nby HO 12 are those used to laminate or combine two or more sheets of paper or\ncardboard to form a multiple-ply product by applying an adhesive and running\nthe paper through various pressure rolls.  </p><p>b.    \nLaminators, such as the GBC Pouch\nLaminator, which are designed to encase a document such as an identification\ncard between two pieces of plastic by using heat in a simple process, are not\nsubject to HO 12. </p><p>c.    \nMachines designed to enclose and\nseal products (i.e., pills and capsules) in packaging consisting primarily of\nplastic or foil and some cardboard or paperboard, are not within the scope of\nHO 12.  Names for this type of machine include dry mounting/laminating press;\njumbo sealer; and the euclid cadet or cadet twin unit dose strip packaging\nmachine.</p><p>(2)  Silk Screen printing press</p><p>This equipment, when\ndesigned to function in the same manner as the platen printing press, is\nprohibited for use by persons under the age of 18.</p><p>(3)  Three spindle paper drill (Challenge Model EH-3A for\nexample)</p><p>This equipment, used\nfor die-cutting or embossing operations, operates in the same manner as a hand\nfed punch press.  Minors under 18 years of age are prohibited from operating\nthis equipment. </p><p>(4)  Kansmacker</p><p>The kansmacker is a\npower-driven machine that sorts, counts and flattens beverage cans.  It is not\ncovered by HO 12.</p><p>(5)  Decollators and bursters</p><p>A decollator is a\nmachine which separates stacks of multi-part paper into individual stacks (for\neach copy) while removing the carbon paper.  It is often capable of trimming\nthe pin-feed holes from one or both sides.  A burster is a machine that takes\ncontinuous single copy and bursts it into individual sheets or pages.  These\nmachines do not come within the definition of paper products machines and are\nnot covered under HO 12.</p><p>(6)  Cylinder press</p><p>HO 12 does not\nprohibit the operation of a cylinder press.  Such machines are considered much\nless hazardous than platen presses, where feeding takes place at the point of\noperation. </p><p>(7)  Paper shredders </p><p>The operation of paper\nshredders is not prohibited by HO 12.  In addition, paper shredders of the type\nnormally used in offices may be operated by minors 14 and 15 years of age.</p><p>(8)  Stitcher-trimmer machine</p><p>a.    \nA stitcher-trimmer machine\nautomatically collates, stitches (inserts wire staples), and trims such things\nas pamphlets, periodicals, and other paper products.  WHD has examined\nstitcher-trimmer machines and has determined that HO 12 does not prohibit minors\nfrom operating those stitcher-trimmer machines that do not use a guillotine\npaper cutter or shear to trim the product.  This machine is not to be confused\nwith an arm-type wire stitcher or stapler – a power-driven machine\nprohibited by HO 12, operated by a foot treadle, and used to stitch or staple\ncartons together (see FOH 33h12(b)(1)b).    </p><p>b.    \nHO 12 does prohibit youth under 18\nyears of age from operating those stitcher-trimmers that use a guillotine paper\ncutter or shear to trim the product.  Such prohibited equipment includes the STAHL\nST-90 and the Stitchmaster ST-100, both manufactured by\nHeidelberg.  </p><p>(9)  LiftPak compactor</p><p>a.    \nThe LiftPak Compactor Model 1000,\nmanufactured by LiftPak, L.C., is an indoor compactor that processes material,\nincluding paper products, by use of a ram.  This equipment is often used by\nquick service restaurants.  When it is time to unload the machine, a built-in\ncart containing the compacted waste is detached from the machine and manually\nwheeled to the dumpster.  The operator then pushes a button on the cart and an\nelectric lift raises the compacted refuse to the height of the dumpster.  After\nthe lift tray is released, the refuse is allowed to fall into the dumpster by\ngravity.  The operator then lowers the lift and wheels the cart back to the\nmain machine for reattaching. </p><p>b.    \nBecause the LiftPak Compactor\nModel 1000 is a compactor that processes materials such as food waste and\nplastic in addition to paper products, youth under 18 years of age are\nprohibited from operating and unloading such equipment (as of February 14,\n2005)—and may only load such equipment if they meet the requirements of the\nexemption contained in HO 12 (see 29 CFR 570.63(c) and\nFOH 33h12(d)(2)).  The prohibition on unloading includes all the\nactivities associated with depositing the compacted refuse into the dumpster,\nincluding returning and reattaching the built-in cart to the equipment.</p><p>c.    \nWH learned that LiftPak, L.C. has\nmarketed the Model 1000 as a compactor that “employees don’t have to be 18 to\noperate…” and has stated on its Webpage that the Department of Labor has\napproved the equipment for use by employees 16 and older.  Although such\nadvertisements may have been proper prior to the publication of the Final Rule\nthat modified HO 12 effective February 14, 2005, this information is no longer\ncorrect.  </p><p>d.    \nThe electric lift that raises the\ndetached compaction compartment to the height of the dumpster during the\nunloading process cannot be considered a hoisting apparatus prohibited under HO\n7.  But as mentioned in (b) above, the detaching, emptying, and reattaching of\nthe container containing the waste is prohibited as “unloading” under HO 12.</p>"},{"section":"33h13","chapter":"33","section_title":"33h13.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 13—Brick Tile and Kindred Products.","text":"Name:  Occupations Involved in the Manufacture of Brick, Tile, and\nKindred Products Originally Adopted:  September 1, 1956 (a)  \nScope of HO 13 (1)  The rate of injuries in the clay/silica construction\nproducts industry (as determined by the report establishing HO 13) exceeded the\ninjury rate (including serious injuries) found in the majority of manufacturing\nestablishments.  The report attributed the higher frequency of worker injuries\nin this industry to:  lifting, carrying, and pushing heavy objects; bricks\nfalling on workers from stacks or out of the workers’ hands onto themselves,\nvehicle—pedestrian accidents, machine injuries, and falls caused by slippery\nfloors.  The report recommended that a Hazardous Occupations Order be created\nto ban the employment of minors in most occupations in the clay/silica\nconstruction products industry. (2)  HO 13 is industry specific.  It applies to all work in\nor about plants manufacturing clay construction products – except work in the\ndrying departments of plants manufacturing sewer pipe, in storage and shipping,\nin offices, in laboratories, and in storerooms.  It also applies to work in or\nabout plants manufacturing silica brick, or other silica refractories, except\nwork in offices. (3)  Definitions a.    \nThe term clay construction\nproducts includes the following:  brick, hollow structural tile, sewer pipe and\nkindred products, refractories, and other clay products, such as: \narchitectural terra cotta, glazed structural tile, roofing tile, stove lining,\nchimney pipes and tops, wall coping, and drain tile.  The term does not include\nnon-structural clay products, such as ceramic floor and wall tile, mosaic tile,\nglazed and enameled tile, faience and similar tile.  Nor does the term include\nnon-clay construction products such as sand-lime brick, glass brick, or\nnon-clay refractories. b.    \nThe term silica brick or other\nsilica refractories means refractory products produced from raw materials\ncontaining

prohibited by HO\n13.  The glaze contains free silica as a main constituent; consequently, the\narea where it is produced meets the definition of an establishment where silica\nrefractories are manufactured (see 29 CFR 570.64(a)(2) and\n570.64(b)(2)).  In light of the preceding, work in or about such an\nestablishment is prohibited. (2)  Asbestos Asbestos is a form of\nmagnesium silicate; however, it does not contain any free silica.  Since it does\nnot contain free silica, establishments manufacturing asbestos are not making a\nsilica refractory and are not covered by HO 13. (3)  Shipping and storage of brick a.    \nPreparing bricks for storage,\ninside the manufacturing building and adjacent to the kilns (even after the\nbricks have been removed from the kiln and placed on flat cars), is work\ncovered by HO 13.  For example: stacking the bricks on skids, and strapping\nthem down in order to move them to a storage area outside the building, is work\nconsidered to be within the drawing and wheeling department and not within the\npurview of storage and shipping. b.    \nRemoving bricks from inside the\nkiln in the process of loading them or moving them to storage, is not work in\nstorage and shipping, and therefore is covered by HO 13. (4)  Clay drain tile The setting and\ndrawing of tile in clay drain tile plant is prohibited by HO 13.","html":"<p>Name:

ORDER 16—Roofing Operations and   Work On\nor About a Roof.","text":"Name:  Occupations in Roofing Operations and On or About a Roof Originally Adopted:  December 27, 1961 (a)  \nScope of HO 16 (1)  At the time HO 16 was written, roofing had long been\nrecognized as one of the most hazardous occupations in the building\nconstruction industry.  The report establishing HO 16 determined the hazards\nassociated with roofing – such as falling from roofs and leaning out over the\nedge of a roof to receive hoisted materials – were difficult to control and the\nresulting injuries were frequently very serious.  In light of this, the report\nconcluded that “all work performed in connection with the application of\nweather-proofing materials and substances to the roofs of buildings and\nstructures is too hazardous for the employment of 16 and 17 year old persons.” (2)  HO 16 was originally specific to the roofing industry,\nprohibiting all roofing industry operations, including those operations not\nperformed on a roof.  HO 16 was revised, effective February 14, 2005, to also\nprohibit all work on or about a roof (see 69 FR 75397-98).   (3)  Definitions (see 29 CFR 570.67(b)) a.    \nThe term roofing operations means\nall work performed in connection with the installation of roofs, including\nrelated metal work such as flashing, and applying weatherproofing materials and\nsubstances (such as waterproof membranes, tar, slag or pitch, asphalt prepared paper,\ntile, composite roofing materials, slate, metal, translucent materials, and\nshingles of asbestos, asphalt, wood or other materials) to roofs of buildings\nor other structures.  The term also includes all jobs on the ground related to\nroofing operations such as roofing laborer, roofing helper,

additions, maintenance and repair,\nincluding painting and coating of existing roofs; the construction of the\nsheathing or base of roofs (wood or metal), including roof trusses or joists;\ngutter and downspout work; the installation and servicing of television and\ncommunication equipment such as cable and satellite dishes; the installation\nand servicing of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment or similar\nappliances attached to roofs; and any similar work that is required to be\nperformed on or about roofs. 1.    \nThe regulatory phrase on or about\na roof is not limited to circumstances where the minor employee is standing or\nworking on the roof itself.  The prohibition extends to standing or working on\na ladder or scaffold at or near the roof, working on the installation of roof\ntrusses or joists which will support the roof, as well as working from or being\ntransported to or from the roof in mechanical devices such as hoists.   2.    \nGenerally, 16- and 17-year-olds\nmay legally perform certain occupations that require them to work at heights,\nsuch as painting, window washing, installing siding, and the power-washing of\nwalls.  But such occupations would be prohibited when the minor is required to\nwork in close proximity to a roof.  WH has adopted two enforcement positions\nthat provide guidance as to when the employment of a youth performing such\noccupations violates HO 16 because he or she is working in close proximity\nto a roof (See FOH 33h16(d)(1)). (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED (1)  HO 16 prohibits all occupations in roofing\noperations.  This includes work done on the ground such as material handling,\ntending tar kettles, and clean-up work. (2)  As of February 14, 2005, HO 16 also prohibits the\nperformance of any work on or about a roof. (3)  Minors under 18 years of age are also prohibited from\nusing a roof as a point of access, egress, or a platform from which to access\nor perform other work such as window washing or the rigging of window washing\nequipment. (c)  \nExemptions HO 16 does contain an exemption for student-learners and apprentices. \nThere are no other exemptions applicable to this order. (d)  \nEnforcement positions (1)  Working in close proximity to a roof a.    \nSingle-story building  1.    \nWH will not charge a violation of\nHO 16 when a minor is working in proximity to a roof of a one-story building as\nlong as the minor’s feet are never more than three feet off the ground level. \nThe three-foot tolerance is measured from the ground or pavement at the base of\nthe building to the bottom of the minor’s feet.   2.    \nThe minor is still prohibited from\nperforming any work described in FOH 33h16(a)(3) above. b.    \nMultiple-story building 1.    \nWH will not charge a violation of\nHO 16 when a minor is working in proximity to a roof of a multi-story building\n(a building of more than one story) if the minor always maintains a distance of\nat least three feet (36 inches) from the roof edge.  The 36 inches is measured\nfrom the top of the youth’s head to bottom edge of the roof that is directly\nover (perpendicular to) the youth’s head.      2.    \nA distance of 3 feet ensures that\nthe working minor, no matter how long his or her reach, will not come into\ncontact with the bottom edge of the roof of a multi-story building. 3.    \nUsing a straight, vertical line\nfrom the top of the minor’s head to the bottom of the roof’s edge to measure\nthe 36 inch allowance permits minors to work at various heights on buildings\nthat do not have horizontal or single-level roof lines, such as split level\nbuildings, gabled buildings and sheds. c.    \nThe enforcement positions\ndiscussed in a. and b. above apply only as long as the minor does not use the\nroof to egress the work area and is not performing work that is prohibited by\nHO 16 or any other HO. (2)  Removal of an old roof The tearing off of the\nold roof in conjunction with the installation of a new roof is considered a\n“roofing operation” and is covered under HO 16, notwithstanding that different\nmechanics may perform this work in various geographic areas. (3)  Metal buildings   a.    \nPrior to February 14, 2005, the\ninstallation of metal roofs generally did not fall within the prohibitions of\nHO 16 because such work was normally performed entirely by ironworkers,\nsteelworkers, or sheet metal mechanics – not by roofers.  Consequently, in most\ninstances, this work was not considered a “roofing operation” prohibited by HO\n16.  On February 14, 2005, HO 16 was revised to prohibit youth under 18 years of\nage from installing metal roofs, including those on metal buildings (see\n29 CFR 570.67(b)). b.    \nRoofing companies do occasionally\nremove existing all-metal roofs and replace them, and the purlins, with a new\nroof.  The work continues to be considered a “roofing operation” covered by HO\n16. (4)  Weatherproofing the top of television transmitting\ntowers   The definition of a\nroofing operation includes the application of weatherproofing materials to\nroofs of buildings, or other structures (see 29 CFR 570.67(b)).  Consequently,\nweatherproofing the top of television transmitting towers is covered by HO 16.  (5)  Measuring a roof The measuring of a\nroof to estimate the cost of a new roof is work “performed in connection with\nthe installation of roofs…” and it is covered by HO 16.","html":"<p>Name:  Occupations in Roofing Operations and On or About a Roof</p><p>Originally Adopted:  December

industry.  The report establishing HO 16 determined the hazards\nassociated with roofing – such as falling from roofs and leaning out over the\nedge of a roof to receive hoisted materials – were difficult to control and the\nresulting injuries were frequently very serious.  In light of this, the report\nconcluded that “all work performed in connection with the application of\nweather-proofing materials and substances to the roofs of buildings and\nstructures is too hazardous for the employment of 16 and 17 year old persons.”</p><p>(2)  HO 16 was originally specific to the roofing industry,\nprohibiting all roofing industry operations, including those operations not\nperformed on a roof.  HO 16 was revised, effective February 14, 2005, to also\nprohibit all work on or about a

Regulations at 29 CFR\n1630.2 (h), (i) and (j), issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under\nthe Americans with Disability Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq., define these\nterms. The Americans with\nDisabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) significantly broadened the\nscope of the ADA’s definition of disability.  Because the FMLA’s definition of\nan adult son or daughter relies on the ADA’s definition of disability, the\nchanges to the definition of disability set forth in the ADAAA and its implementing\nregulations apply to the definition of a son or daughter 18 years of age or\nolder under the FMLA.  See WHD Administrator’s Interpretation No. 2013-1. 1.     “Substantially\nlimits” does not require that the impairment prevents, or severely or significantly\nrestricts, the individual in performing a major life activity. 2.     Major\nlife activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing\nmanual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting,\nbending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking,\ncommunicating, interacting with others, and working.  Major life activities\nalso include the operation of major bodily functions, such as functions of the\nimmune system, normal cell growth, and digestive, brain, respiratory,\nneurological and reproductive functions. 3.     The\nuse of mitigating measures to ameliorate the effects of an impairment may not\nbe considered when determining the limitations on a major life activity, except\nfor the use of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses. 4.     An\nimpairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if the impairment\nwould substantially limit a major life activity when active.  Examples include,\nbut are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, asthma, epilepsy, diabetes, lupus,\npost traumatic stress disorder and cancer in remission. 5.     There\nis no minimum duration of time required for an impairment to be considered a\ndisability. 6.     The\nterm disability is to be construed in favor of broad coverage when determining\nif an individual has a disability. 7.     The\nEEOC’s regulations provide that some impairments will virtually always qualify\nas disabilities because, by their very nature, they substantially limit at\nleast one major life activity.  Impairments that should easily be concluded to\nbe substantially limiting include deafness, blindness, intellectual disability,\nmissing limbs or mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair,\nautism, cancer, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”) infection, muscular dystrophy, major depressive\ndisorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive\ncompulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. c.     Incapable\nof self-care Incapable of\nself-care means that the individual requires active assistance or supervision\nto provide daily self-care in three or more “activities of daily living” (ADLs)\nor “instrumental activities of daily living” (IADLs) due to a disability. 1.     Activities\nof daily living include adaptive activities such as caring appropriately for\none’s grooming and hygiene, bathing, dressing and eating. 2.     Instrumental\nactivities of daily living include cooking, cleaning, shopping, taking public transportation,\npaying bills, maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, using\na post office, etc. 3.     These\nlists of ADLs and IADLs are not exhaustive and additional activities should\nalso be considered in determining whether an adult son or daughter is incapable\nof self-care due to a disability. 4.     The\ndetermination of whether an adult son or daughter is incapable of self-care is\nmade based on the individual’s condition at the time the employee requests\nleave.  The determination should include, for example, the current effects of\nany episodic impairment. d.     There\nare special definitions of son and daughter applicable to military family leave\nthat are not limited by age.  See 29 CFR 825.122(h) and (i). (3)  Parent Parent means a biological, adoptive, step or\nfoster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco parentis to\nthe employee when the employee was a son or daughter (as defined by the FMLA). \nThis term does not include parents-in-law. 29 USC 2611(7)29 CFR 825.122(c) There is a special definition of parent\napplicable to military caregiver leave.  29 CFR 825.122(j). (4)  In Loco\nParentis In loco parentis means in the place of a\nparent.  An employee who stands in loco parentis to a child is entitled to\nleave for bonding purposes or if leave is needed to care for the child with a\nserious health condition.  An eligible employee is also entitled to FMLA leave\nto care for someone who stood in loco parentis to the employee when he or she was\na child.  Whether an in loco parentis relationship exists is dependent upon the\nspecific facts of the case.  Factors to be looked at in determining whether an in\nloco parentis relationship exists include: a.     The\nage of the child, b.     The\ndegree to which the child is dependent on the person claiming in loco parentis\nstatus, c.     The\namount of support, if any, provided, and d.     The\nextent to which duties commonly associated with parenthood are exercised. A blood or legal relationship is irrelevant to\ndetermining in loco parentis status.  For example, an employee who will share\nequally in the raising

a\nphysical or mental disability at the time that FMLA leave is to commence.  It\ndoes not matter if the onset of the disability occurs before or after the son\nor daughter turns 18 for purposes of

substantially limits one\nor more of the major life activities of an individual. Regulations at 29 CFR\n1630.2 (h), (i) and (j), issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under\nthe Americans with Disability Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq., define these\nterms.</p><p>The Americans with\nDisabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) significantly broadened the\nscope of the ADA’s definition of disability.  Because the FMLA’s definition of\nan adult son or daughter relies on the ADA’s definition of disability, the\nchanges to the definition of disability set forth in the ADAAA and its implementing\nregulations apply to the definition of a son or daughter 18 years of age or\nolder under the FMLA.  See WHD Administrator’s Interpretation No. 2013-1.</p><p>1.     “Substantially\nlimits” does not require that the impairment prevents, or severely or significantly\nrestricts, the individual in performing a major life activity.</p><p>2.     Major\nlife activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing\nmanual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting,\nbending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking,\ncommunicating, interacting with others, and working.  Major life activities\nalso include the operation of major bodily functions, such as functions of the\nimmune system, normal cell growth, and digestive, brain, respiratory,\nneurological and reproductive functions.</p><p>3.     The\nuse of mitigating measures to ameliorate the effects of an impairment may not\nbe considered when determining the limitations on a major life activity, except\nfor the use of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses.</p><p>4.     An\nimpairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if the impairment\nwould substantially limit a major life activity when active.  Examples include,\nbut are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, asthma, epilepsy, diabetes, lupus,\npost traumatic stress disorder and cancer in remission.</p><p>5.     There\nis no minimum duration of time required for an impairment to be considered a\ndisability.</p><p>6.     The\nterm disability is to be construed in favor of broad coverage when determining\nif an individual has a disability.</p><p>7.     The\nEEOC’s regulations provide that some impairments will virtually always qualify\nas disabilities because, by their very nature, they substantially limit at\nleast one major life activity.  Impairments that should easily be concluded to\nbe substantially limiting include deafness, blindness, intellectual disability,\nmissing limbs or mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair,\nautism, cancer, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”) infection, muscular dystrophy, major depressive\ndisorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive\ncompulsive disorder, and schizophrenia.</p><p>c.     Incapable\nof self-care</p><p>Incapable of\nself-care means that the individual requires active assistance or supervision\nto provide daily self-care in three or more “activities of daily living” (ADLs)\nor “instrumental activities of daily living” (IADLs) due to a disability.</p><p>1.     Activities\nof daily living include adaptive activities such as caring appropriately for\none’s grooming and hygiene, bathing, dressing and eating.</p><p>2.     Instrumental\nactivities of daily living include cooking, cleaning, shopping, taking public transportation,\npaying bills, maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, using\na post office, etc.</p><p>3.     These\nlists of ADLs and IADLs are not exhaustive and additional activities should\nalso be considered in determining whether an adult son or daughter is incapable\nof self-care due to a disability.</p><p>4.     The\ndetermination of whether an adult son or daughter is incapable of self-care is\nmade based on the individual’s condition at the time the employee requests\nleave.  The determination should include, for example, the current effects of\nany episodic impairment.</p><p>d.     There\nare special definitions of son and daughter applicable to military family leave\nthat are not limited by age.  See 29 CFR 825.122(h) and (i).</p><p>(3)  Parent</p><p>Parent means a biological, adoptive, step or\nfoster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco parentis to\nthe employee when the employee was a son or daughter (as defined by the FMLA). \nThis term does not include parents-in-law.</p><p>29 USC 2611(7)</p><p>29 CFR

a\nparent.  An employee who stands in loco parentis to a child is entitled to\nleave for bonding purposes or if leave is needed to care for the child with a\nserious health condition.  An eligible employee is also entitled to FMLA leave\nto care for someone who stood in loco parentis to the employee when he or she was\na child.  Whether an in loco parentis relationship exists is dependent upon the\nspecific facts of the case.  Factors to be looked at in determining whether an in\nloco parentis relationship exists include:</p><p>a.     The\nage of the child,</p><p>b.     The\ndegree to which the child is dependent on the person claiming in loco parentis\nstatus,</p><p>c.     The\namount of support, if any, provided, and</p><p>d.     The\nextent to which duties commonly associated with parenthood are exercised.</p><p>A blood or legal relationship is irrelevant to\ndetermining in loco parentis status.  For example, an employee who will share\nequally in the raising of an adopted child with a same-sex partner, but who\ndoes not have a legal relationship with the child, stands in loco parentis to\nthe child.  In addition, the fact that a child has a biological mother

28, 2009.  Therefore,\nthe family member requesting FMLA leave will have three years to begin military\ncaregiver leave starting on March 8, 2013. B.    However,\nif a servicemember was discharged on December 1, 2003, the discharge would have\noccurred more than five years prior to October 28, 2009 and the veteran would\nnot be a covered veteran for military caregiver leave purposes. 29 USC 2611(15)(B)29 CFR 825.127(b)(2) (2)  A serious\ninjury or illness for a covered servicemember is: a.     Current\nservicemember’s serious injury or illness 1.     An\ninjury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that may render\nthe servicemember medically unfit to perform the duties of his or her office,\ngrade, rank, or rating, or 2.     An\ninjury or illness that existed before the beginning of the servicemember’s\nactive duty and was aggravated by service in line of duty on active duty in the\nArmed Forces that may render the member medically unfit to perform the duties\nof his or her office, grade, rank, or rating. 29 USC 2611(18)(A)29 CFR 825.127(c)(1) b.     Veteran’s\nserious injury or illness 1.     An\ninjury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that that\nmanifested itself before or after the servicemember became a veteran and that\nis: A.    A\ncontinuation of a serious injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated\nwhen the veteran was a member of the Armed Forces and rendered the\nservicemember unable to perform the duties of the servicemember’s office,\ngrade, rank, or rating, or B.    A\nphysical or mental condition for which the veteran has received a U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Service-Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50\npercent or greater, and the VASRD rating is based, in whole or in part, on the\ncondition precipitating the need for military caregiver leave, or C.    A\nphysical or mental condition that substantially impairs the veteran’s ability\nto work because of a disability or disabilities related to military service, or\nwould do so absent treatment, or D.    An\ninjury that is the basis for the veteran’s enrollment in the Department of\nVeterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. 2.     An\ninjury or illness that existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty\nand was aggravated by service in line of duty on active duty in the Armed\nForces that otherwise meets any of the definitions in A – D above. 29 USC 2611(18)(B)29 CFR 825.127(c)(2) (3)  26 workweeks of\nleave in a 12-month period a.     The\nsingle 12-month period for military caregiver leave begins on the first day the\nemployee takes FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember and ends 12\nmonths after that date, regardless of the method used by the employer to\ndetermine the employee’s 12 workweeks of leave entitlement for other\nFMLA-qualifying reasons. For example, if an\nemployee first takes military caregiver leave beginning June 1, 2013, the\nemployee’s single 12-month period for military caregiver leave is June 1, 2013\nthrough May 31, 2014, regardless of the fact that the employer may use the\ncalendar year for tracking FMLA leave usage. If an employee does\nnot take all of his or her 26 workweeks to care for a covered servicemember\nduring this single 12-month period, the remaining leave is forfeited. b.     The\nsingle 12-month period is applied on a per-covered servicemember, per-injury\nbasis.  Therefore, an eligible employee may take more than one period of 26\nworkweeks of leave if the leave is to care for a different covered\nservicemember or to care for the same servicemember with a subsequent\n(different) serious injury or illness.  However, no more than 26 workweeks of\nleave may be taken within any single 12-month period. 1.     A\nsubsequent serious injury or illness of the same covered servicemember could\narise either from a different injury or illness incurred by the current sevicemember\nduring a subsequent deployment or from a different injury or illness that relates\nback to the initial incident but that manifests at a later time. A.    For\nexample, an eligible employee may take leave in one 12-month period to care for\na servicemember who incurs a traumatic brain injury and take leave in a\nsubsequent 12-month period to care for the same servicemember who returns to\nduty and is injured by an incendiary explosive device. B.    Additionally,\nif a current covered servicemember suffers severe burns in the line of duty, an\neligible employee is entitled to 26 workweeks of military caregiver leave.  If\nthe servicemember later manifests post traumatic stress disorder that was\nincurred in the same incident as the burns, the eligible employee would be\nentitled to an additional 26 workweeks of leave to care for the same\nservicemember. 2.     A\n“current” covered servicemember and a “veteran” covered servicemember will be\nconsidered different covered servicemembers for purposes of the 26 workweeks in\na single 12-month period requirement.  Therefore, an eligible employee could\ntake military caregiver leave to care for a current servicemember who suffered\na burn injury while in active duty service and later take leave to care for the\nsame servicemember for the same injury when the servicemember becomes a veteran. \nAll normal eligibility requirements would apply when the employee seeks\nmilitary caregiver leave to care for the veteran. 29 CFR 825.127(e),\n825.200(b)77 FR 8960, 897073 FR 67934, 6796978 FR 883478 FR 8854 c.     During\nthe single 12-month period the employee can take a combined total of 26\nworkweeks of leave, no more than 12 weeks of which can be for any combination\nof FMLA-qualifying reasons other than military caregiver leave (i.e., leave for\nthe birth or placement of a child, leave due to the serious health condition of\nthe employee or the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent, or leave due\nto a qualifying exigency arising from a military member’s covered active duty\nstatus).  However, the employee’s entitlement to FMLA leave for reasons other\nthan military caregiver leave is limited by his or her prior use of FMLA leave\nduring the applicable 12-month period. 1.     For\nexample, where an employee first takes military caregiver leave beginning June\n1, 2013 and works for an employer who uses the calendar year for tracking FMLA\nleave usage, the employee’s single 12-month period for military caregiver leave\nis June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014.  If the employee had used five weeks of\nFMLA leave between January 1 and June 1, 2013 for a qualifying reason other\nthan military caregiver leave, such as for his own serious health condition, he\nwould only have seven weeks of FMLA leave for a qualifying reason other than\nmilitary caregiver leave available through December 31, 2013.  Once the\nemployee exhausts his 26-workweek entitlement, he may not take any FMLA leave\nfor any reason until the single 12-month period ends. 2.     Thus,\nif the employee used 20 weeks of military caregiver leave from June-December,\n2013, four weeks of leave in January, 2014 for his own serious health\ncondition, and another two weeks of military caregiver leave in March, 2014,\nthe employee will have exhausted his 26-workeek entitlement for the single\n12-month period (June 1, 2013-May 31, 2014).  The employee would still have\neight weeks of FMLA leave for a qualifying reason other than military caregiver\nleave available in calendar year 2014; however, he could not take this leave\nuntil after the single 12-month period ends on May 31, 2014. 29 CFR 825.127(e)73 FR 67934,\n67970-67971 (4)  Qualifying\nleave to care for a family member with a serious health condition Leave that qualifies as both leave to care for\na covered servicemember and leave to care for a family member with a serious\nhealth condition during the single 12-month period must be designated by the\nemployer as leave to care for a covered servicemember.  It cannot be designated\nand counted as leave for both reasons. 28 CFR 825.127(e)(3) (5)  Spouses working\nfor the same employer Spouses employed by the same employer are\nlimited to a combined total of 26 workweeks of leave during the single 12-month\nperiod if the leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember with a serious\ninjury or illness or for a combination of military caregiver leave and leave\nfor the birth of the employee’s son or daughter, placement of a son or daughter\nwith the employee for adoption of foster care, or to care for the employee’s\nparent with a serious health condition.  See FOH 39e03. 29 CFR 825.127(f) (b)   Definitions (1)  Outpatient\nstatus The status of a member of the Armed Forces\nassigned to either a military medical treatment facility as an outpatient or a\nunit established for the purpose of providing command and control of members of\nthe Armed Forces receiving medical care as outpatients. 29 USC 2611(16)29 CFR 825.127(b)(1) (2)  Son or daughter\nof a covered servicemember The covered servicemember’s biological,\nadopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child for whom the\ncovered servicemember stood in loco parentis, and who is of any age. 29 CFR 825.127(d)(1) (3)  Parent of a\ncovered servicemember A covered servicemember’s biological, adoptive,\nstep, or foster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco\nparentis to the covered servicemember.  This does not include parents “in law.” 29 CFR 825.127(d)(2) (4)  Next of kin of\na covered servicemember The covered servicemember’s next of kin is the\nservicemember’s nearest blood relative.  The next of kin is someone other than\nthe servicemember’s spouse, parent, son or daughter, and is determined in the\nfollowing order of priority: a.     Designated\nnext of kin for purposes of military caregiver leave under the FMLA The covered\nservicemember may specifically designate in writing his or her nearest blood\nrelative for purposes of military caregiver leave under the FMLA.  When such\ndesignation has been made, the designated individual is deemed the covered\nservicemember’s only next of kin.  The designated next of kin must be a blood\nrelative of the covered servicemember. b.     Order\nof priority When a servicemember\ndoes not make a designation for purposes of FMLA leave, the next of kin is determined\nin the following order of priority: 1.     Blood\nrelatives who have been granted legal custody of the servicemember by court\ndecree or statutory provisions, 2.     Brothers\nand sisters, 3.     Grandparents, 4.     Aunts\nand uncles, 5.     First\ncousins. When there are\nmultiple family members with the same level of relationship and the covered\nservicemember has not designated a next of kin for FMLA purposes, all such\nfamily members are considered the next of kin and all may take leave to provide\ncare to the covered servicemember, either consecutively or simultaneously. For example, if a\ncovered servicemember has three siblings and has not designated a blood\nrelative to provide care for FMLA purposes, all three siblings would be\nconsidered the covered servicemember’s next of kin.  Alternatively, where a\ncovered servicemember has one or more siblings and designates a cousin as his\nor her next of kin for FMLA purposes, then only the designated cousin is\neligible as the covered servicemember’s next of kin. 29 USC 2611(17)29 CFR 825.127(d)(3)","html":"<p>(a)

intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule under the following\nconditions: a.     When\nthere is a medical need for leave that can be best accommodated through an\nintermittent or reduced leave schedule for an employee’s own serious health\ncondition, to care for a spouse, parent, son, or daughter with a serious health\ncondition, or to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or\nillness.  Such leave may be necessary for planned and/or unanticipated medical\ntreatment of a serious health condition or of a serious injury or illness of a covered\nservicemember, or during recovery from treatment.  It may also be taken to\nprovide care or psychological comfort to a spouse, parent, son, or daughter\nwith a serious health condition or a covered servicemember with a serious\ninjury or illness.  Examples of medically necessary intermittent leave include: 1.     Leave\ntaken for a condition which requires treatment by a health care provider\nperiodically, rather than for one continuous period of time, and may include\nleave of periods from an hour or more to several weeks, 2.     Leave\ntaken by a pregnant employee for prenatal examinations or for periods of severe\nmorning sickness, 3.     Leave\ntaken for absences where a family member is incapacitated or the employee is unable\nto perform the essential functions of the position intermittently because of a\nchronic serious health condition, even if he or she does not receive treatment\nfrom a health care provider. b.     When\nleave is taken due to a qualifying exigency. (2)  Intermittent\nleave or a reduced leave schedule after the birth of a healthy child or\nplacement of a healthy child for adoption or foster care may only be taken if\nthe employer agrees. 29 USC 2612(b)(1)29 CFR 825.202 (b)   Scheduling\nof leave If an employee needs\nleave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule for planned medical\ntreatment, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment\nso as not to disrupt unduly the employer’s operations. 29 USC 2612(e)(2)29 CFR 825.203 (c)   Transfer to\nan alternate position (1)  If an employee\nneeds intermittent leave that is foreseeable based on planned medical\ntreatment, the employer may require the employee to transfer temporarily,\nduring the period that the intermittent or reduced leave schedule is required,\nto an alternative position for which the employee is qualified and that better\naccommodates recurring periods of leave. (2)  An employer\nmust provide equivalent pay and benefits in the alternative position, but the\nposition does not have to have equivalent duties.  The employer may increase\nthe pay and benefits of an existing alternative position to make them\nequivalent to those of the employee’s regular job.  Where an employer’s normal\npractice bases benefits on the number of hours worked, the employer may\nproportionately reduce benefits for an employee’s reduced hours worked. (3)  An employer may\nnot transfer an employee to an alternative position in order to discourage the\nemployee from taking leave or otherwise work a hardship on the employee.  See\nFOH 39o. (4)  When an\nemployee no longer needs to continue on intermittent or reduced schedule leave\nand is able to return to full-time work, the employer must place the employee\nin the same or equivalent job as the job the employee left when the leave\ncommenced.  The employee may not be required to take more leave than necessary\nto address the circumstance that precipitated the need for leave. (5)  The FMLA limits\nan employer’s ability to require that an employee transfer to an alternate\nposition to situations involving foreseeable leave for planned medical\ntreatment.  This is the only situation where an employer may require a\ntransfer. 73 FR 67934, 67974-67975 29 USC 2612(b)(2)29 CFR 825.204 (d)   Increments\nof leave (1)  The employer\nmust account for intermittent leave or reduced schedule leave by no greater\nthan the shortest period of time used to account for other forms of leave,\nprovided it is not greater than one hour and does not reduce the employee’s\nFMLA entitlement by more than the amount of leave actually taken.  For example,\nif an employer accounts for the use of annual leave in increments of one hour\nand the use of sick leave in increments of one-half hour, then FMLA leave use\nmust be accounted for using increments no larger than one-half hour.   If the\nemployer accounts for other forms of leave use in increments greater than one\nhour during the period the FMLA leave is taken, the employer must account for\nFMLA leave in increments no greater than one hour.   See FOH 39m02 for special\nrules applicable to airline flight crew employees. (2)  If an employer\nuses varying increments to account for leave usage at different times of the\nday or shift, the employer may not account for FMLA leave in a larger increment\nthan the shortest period used to account for other leave during the period the\nFMLA leave is taken.  For example, if an employer usually accounts for all\ntypes of leave in increments of 15 minutes, but accounts for all non-FMLA leave\nfor the first hour of the day in 30-minute increments, the employer may also\naccount for FMLA leave in an increment no greater than 30 minutes only during\nthe first hour of the day. (3)  Where it is\nphysically impossible for an employee using intermittent leave or working a\nreduced leave schedule to commence or end work mid-way through a shift, the\nentire period that the employee is forced to be absent is designated as FMLA\nleave and counts against the employee’s entitlement.  The “physical\nimpossibility” provision is intended to be narrowly construed and applied only\nin instances of true physical impossibility.  Thus, if the exception applies to\na flight attendant, train conductor, ferry operator, bus driver, or truck\ndriver whose worksite is on board an airplane, train, boat, bus, or truck, or\nto a laboratory technician whose workplace is inside a clean room that must\nremain sealed for a certain period of time, the exception will only apply until\nthe vehicle has returned to the departure site or while the clean room remains\nsealed. 29 CFR 825.205(a)78 FR 886873 FR 67934, 67976 - 67978 (e)   Calculation\nof leave (1)  The employee’s\nactual workweek is the basis for the FMLA entitlement.a.     If\nan employee is normally required to work more than 40 hours per week, the hours\nworked beyond 40 must be included in determining the employee’s leave entitlement. \nFor example, if an employee normally works overtime in three of every four\nweeks, then such overtime hours are part of the usual and normal workweek\nschedule of the employee and are included in calculating the FMLA entitlement\navailable to the employee. b.     If\novertime hours are not required, or are voluntary, such hours are not counted\nto calculate the employee’s FMLA entitlement and are not counted against the\nemployee’s FMLA entitlement when not worked. 73 FR 67934,\n67978-67979 (2)  The FMLA provides\neligible employees with up to 12 workweeks of leave for qualifying reasons and\nup to 26 workweeks of leave for military caregiver leave.  When an employee\ntakes leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule in periods of less\nthan one full week, only the amount of leave actually taken may be counted\ntoward the employee’s leave entitlement.  An employer may convert fractions of\na workweek to their hourly equivalent so long as the conversion equitably\nreflects the employee’s total hours.  For example, an employee whose actual\nworkweek is always 40 hours per week, is entitled to an hourly equivalent of\n480 hours (12 workweeks × 40 hours per week).  For an employee whose schedule\nvaries from week to week, the hourly equivalent must equitably reflect the\nactual hours that would be worked during each workweek that FMLA leave is\nneeded. (3)  If the\nemployee’s schedule varies from week to week to such an extent that the\nemployer is unable to determine how many hours the employee would have worked\nhad he or she not taken FMLA leave, the employer may use a weekly average of\nthe hours scheduled over the 12 months prior to the period of leave for\ncalculating the employee’s leave entitlement. 29 CFR 825.205(b) and (c)","html":"<p>(a)   General</p><p>(1)  FMLA leave may\nbe taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule under the following\nconditions:</p><p>a.

the first absence in a new 12-month\nleave year.  The employer may seek authentication and clarification and second\nand third opinions for these new medical certifications. 29 C.F.R. 825.305(e) (d)   Authentication\nand clarification of a medical certification (1)  The employer\nmay contact the health care provider for purposes of clarification and\nauthentication of the medical certification after the employer has given the\nemployee an opportunity to cure any deficiencies.  Employers may not ask for\nadditional information beyond that required by the certification form.  To make\nsuch contact, the employer must use a health care provider, a human resources\nprofessional, a leave administrator, or a management official.  Under no\ncircumstances may the employee’s direct supervisor contact the employee’s\nhealth care provider. (2)  Authentication\nmeans providing the health care provider with a copy of the certification and\nrequesting verification that the information contained on the certification\nform was completed and/or authorized by the health care provider who signed the\ndocument.  No additional information may be requested.  Clarification means\ncontacting the health care provider to understand the handwriting on the\nmedical certification or to understand the meaning of a response.  No\nadditional information may be requested. (3)  The\nrequirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\nPrivacy Rule govern the privacy of individually-identifiable health information\ncreated or held by HIPAA-covered entities.  Therefore, HIPAA requirements must\nbe satisfied when an employee’s or an employee’s family member’s\nindividually-identifiable health information is shared with an employer by a\nHIPAA-covered entity.  HIPAA requires, among other things, a written\nauthorization by the employee (or the employee’s family member) in order to\nrelease information for authentication and clarification purposes.  If an\nemployee does not provide such authorization to the health care provider\nallowing the employer to obtain clarification of an unclear certification, and\ndoes not otherwise clarify the certification, the employer may deny the FMLA\nleave. 73 FR 67934, 68018—68019 29 CFR 825.307(a) (e)   Second\nand third medical opinions (1)  An employer who\nhas reason to doubt the validity of a medical certification may request a\nsecond opinion at the employer’s expense.  The employer is permitted to\ndesignate the health care provider for the second opinion as long as the\nprovider is not employed on a regular basis by the employer, is not under\ncontract with the employer, or is not regularly utilized by the employer.  An\nexception can be made if the employee is located in an area where access to\nhealth care is extremely limited, such as a rural area where there may be only\none or two doctors in a relevant specialty.  The designated health care\nprovider must be within normal commuting distance, except in very unusual\ncircumstances, and the employer must reimburse the employee for reasonable\ntravel expenses. (2)  Pending receipt\nof the additional medical opinion, the employee is provisionally entitled to\nFMLA benefits, including maintenance of group health benefits.  If the\ncertifications do not ultimately establish the employee’s entitlement to FMLA leave,\nthe leave cannot be designated as FMLA leave and may be treated as paid or\nunpaid leave under the employer’s established leave policy. (3)  If the first\nand second opinions differ, a third and binding opinion may be required at the\nemployer’s expense.  The third health care provider must be approved jointly by\nthe employer and the employee.  The employer and the employee must each act in\ngood faith to reach agreement on the third opinion provider.  If the employer\ndoes not act in good faith, the employer will be bound by the first medical\ncertification.  If the employee does not act in good faith, the employee will\nbe bound by the second medical certification. (4)  Upon request by\nthe employee, the employer must provide copies of second or third opinions\nwithin five business days absent extenuating circumstances. (5)  If a second or\nthird opinion health care provider requests relevant medical information from\nan employee’s (or his or her family member’s) health care provider, and the\nemployee (or his or her family member) does not authorize his or her health\ncare provider to release relevant medical information, the employer may deny\nthe FMLA leave. 29 USC 2613(c) and (d)29 CFR 825.307(b) - (e) (f)   Medical\ncertification abroad In circumstances in\nwhich the employee or family member is visiting another country, or a family\nmember resides in another country, and a serious health condition develops, employers\nmust accept medical certifications, including second and third opinions, from a\nhealth care provider who practices in that country.  If a certification by a\nforeign health care provider is not in English, the employee must provide a\nwritten translation at the employer’s request. 29 CFR 825.307(f) (g)   Recertification (1)  An employer may\nrequest a recertification for leave taken because of an employee’s own serious\nhealth condition or the serious health condition of a family member. \nGenerally, an employer may ask for recertification no more frequently than\nevery 30 days and only in connection with an absence by the employee.  However,\nif the minimum duration indicated on the medical certification exceeds 30 days,\nan employer must wait the indicated minimum duration before requesting a\nrecertification (unless the exception in (g)(5) below applies).  In all cases,\nhowever, an employer may request a recertification of a medical condition every\nsix months in connection with an absence by the employee.  This could apply\nwhen, for example, the health care provider indicates a condition will last “a\nlifetime”. (2)  The employer\nmay ask for the same information as permitted for the initial medical\ncertification.  In addition, the employer may provide a record of the employee’s\nabsence pattern to the health care provider and ask if the serious health\ncondition and need for leave is consistent with such pattern. (3)  The employer\nmust allow at least 15 calendar days for the employee to provide the requested\nrecertification, unless it is not practicable under the particular\ncircumstances despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts. (4)  The employer\nmay contact the health care provider to authenticate or clarify the\nrecertification.  No second or third opinions may be required on a\nrecertification.  The recertification is at the employee’s expense. (5)  Less than 30\ndays exception An employer may request recertification in less\nthan 30 days if: a.     The\nemployee requests an extension of leave, or b.     Circumstances\ndescribed by the previous certification have changed significantly (for\nexample, if the certification stated the employee needed leave for one to two\ndays for a particular serious health condition and the employee’s absences for that\ncondition lasted four days each the last two times leave was needed, the\nincreased duration might constitute a significant change), or c.     The\nemployer receives information that casts doubt upon the employee’s stated\nreason for the absence or the continuing validity of the certification. (6)  When\nrecertification is not permitted Recertification does not apply to leave taken\nfor a qualifying exigency or to care for a covered servicemember with a serious\ninjury or illness (military caregiver leave). 29 CFR 825.310(d) 29 CFR 825.307(a), 825.308, 825.313(c)WHD Opinion Letter

individually-identifiable health information\ncreated or held by HIPAA-covered entities.  Therefore, HIPAA requirements must\nbe satisfied when an employee’s or an employee’s family member’s\nindividually-identifiable health information is shared with an employer by a\nHIPAA-covered entity.  HIPAA requires, among other things, a written\nauthorization by the employee (or the employee’s family member) in order to\nrelease information for authentication and clarification purposes.  If an\nemployee does not provide such authorization to the health care provider\nallowing the employer to obtain clarification of an unclear certification, and\ndoes not otherwise clarify the certification, the employer may deny the FMLA\nleave.</p><p>73 FR 67934, 68018—68019</p><p>29 CFR 825.307(a)</p><p>(e)   Second\nand third medical opinions</p><p>(1)  An employer who\nhas reason to doubt the validity of a medical certification may request a\nsecond opinion at the employer’s expense.  The employer is permitted to\ndesignate the health care provider for the second opinion as long as the\nprovider is not employed on a regular basis by the employer, is not under\ncontract with the employer, or is not regularly utilized by the employer.  An\nexception can be made if the employee is located in an area where access to\nhealth care is extremely limited, such as a rural area where there may be only\none or two doctors in a relevant specialty.  The designated health care\nprovider must be within normal commuting distance, except in very unusual\ncircumstances, and the employer must reimburse the employee for reasonable\ntravel expenses.</p><p>(2)  Pending receipt\nof the additional medical opinion, the employee is provisionally entitled to\nFMLA benefits, including maintenance of group health benefits.  If the\ncertifications do not ultimately establish the employee’s entitlement to FMLA leave,\nthe leave cannot be designated as FMLA leave and may be treated as paid or\nunpaid leave under the employer’s established leave policy.</p><p>(3)  If the first\nand second opinions differ, a third and binding opinion may be required at the\nemployer’s expense.  The third health care provider must be approved jointly by\nthe employer and the employee.  The employer and the employee must each act in\ngood faith to reach agreement on the third opinion provider.  If the employer\ndoes not act in good faith, the employer will be bound by the first medical\ncertification.  If the employee does not act in good faith, the employee will\nbe bound by the second medical certification.</p><p>(4)  Upon request by\nthe employee, the employer must provide copies of second or third opinions\nwithin five business days absent extenuating circumstances.</p><p>(5)  If a second or\nthird opinion health care provider requests relevant medical information from\nan employee’s (or his or her family member’s) health care provider, and the\nemployee (or his or her family member) does not authorize his or her health\ncare provider to release relevant medical information, the employer may deny\nthe FMLA leave.</p><p>29 USC 2613(c) and (d)</p><p>29 CFR 825.307(b) - (e)</p><p>(f)   Medical\ncertification abroad</p><p>In circumstances in\nwhich the employee or family member is visiting another country, or a family\nmember resides in another country, and a serious health condition develops, employers\nmust accept medical certifications, including second and third opinions, from a\nhealth care provider who practices in that country.  If a certification by a\nforeign health care provider is not in English, the employee must provide a\nwritten translation at the employer’s request.</p><p>29 CFR 825.307(f)</p><p>(g)   Recertification</p><p>(1)  An employer may\nrequest a recertification for leave taken because of an employee’s own serious\nhealth condition or the serious health condition of a family member. \nGenerally, an employer may ask for recertification no more frequently than\nevery 30 days and only in connection with an absence by the employee.  However,\nif the minimum duration indicated on the medical certification exceeds 30 days,\nan employer must wait the indicated minimum duration before requesting a\nrecertification (unless the exception in (g)(5) below applies).  In all cases,\nhowever, an employer may request a recertification of a medical condition every\nsix months in connection with an absence by the employee.  This could apply\nwhen, for example, the health care provider indicates a condition will last “a\nlifetime”.</p><p>(2)  The employer\nmay ask for the same information as permitted for the initial medical\ncertification.  In addition, the employer may provide a record of the employee’s\nabsence pattern to the health care provider and ask if the serious health\ncondition and need for leave is consistent with such pattern.</p><p>(3)  The employer\nmust allow at least 15 calendar days for the employee to provide the requested\nrecertification, unless it is not practicable under the particular\ncircumstances despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts.</p><p>(4)  The employer\nmay contact the health care provider to authenticate or clarify the\nrecertification.  No second or third opinions may be required on a\nrecertification.  The recertification is at the employee’s expense.</p><p>(5)  Less than 30\ndays exception</p><p>An employer may request recertification in less\nthan 30 days if:</p><p>a.     The\nemployee requests an extension of leave, or</p><p>b.     Circumstances\ndescribed by the previous certification have changed significantly (for\nexample, if the certification stated the employee needed leave for one to two\ndays for a particular serious health condition and the employee’s absences for that\ncondition lasted four days each the last two times leave was needed, the\nincreased duration might constitute a significant change), or</p><p>c.     The\nemployer receives information that casts doubt upon the employee’s stated\nreason for the absence or the continuing validity of the certification.</p><p>(6)  When\nrecertification is not permitted</p><p>Recertification does not apply to leave taken\nfor a qualifying exigency or to care for a covered servicemember with a serious\ninjury or illness (military caregiver

key employee is a\nsalaried FMLA-eligible employee who is among the highest paid 10 percent of all\nemployees employed by the employer within 75 miles of the employee’s worksite. \nThe determination of whether a salaried employee is among the highest paid 10\npercent is made at the time the employee gives notice of the need for leave. b.     Substantial\nand grievous economic injury1.     In\norder to deny restoration to a key employee, the employer must determine that\nthe employee’s restoration, not his or her absence, will cause “substantial and\ngrievous economic injury.” 2.     There\nis no precise test for determining the level of hardship or injury the employer\nmust sustain.  If the reinstatement of a key employee threatens the economic\nviability of the firm, that would constitute substantial and grievous economic\ninjury.  A lesser injury which causes substantial, long-term economic injury\nwould also be sufficient.  Minor inconveniences and costs that the employer\nwould experience in the normal course of doing business do not constitute\nsubstantial and grievous economic injury. (2)  An employer who\nbelieves that reinstatement may be denied to a key employee must give written\nnotice to the employee at the time the employee gives notice of the need for\nFMLA leave (or when FMLA leave commences, if earlier) that he or she qualifies\nas a key employee.  The employer must also fully inform the employee of the\npotential consequences with respect to reinstatement and maintenance of health\nbenefits if the employer should determine that substantial and grievous\neconomic injury to the employer's operations will result if the employee is\nreinstated from FMLA leave.  An employer who fails to provide such timely\nnotice will lose its right to deny restoration even if substantial and grievous\neconomic injury will result from reinstatement. (3)  As soon as an\nemployer makes a good faith determination that substantial and grievous\neconomic injury to its operations will result if a key employee is reinstated,\nthe employer must notify the employee in writing of its determination and that\nit cannot deny FMLA leave but that it intends to deny restoration on completion\nof the FMLA leave.  The employer must serve this notice either in person or by\ncertified mail.  This notice must explain the basis for the employer's finding\nthat substantial and grievous economic injury will result, and, if leave has\ncommenced, must provide the employee a reasonable time in which to return to\nwork. (4)  After notification\nof the employer’s intent to deny restoration has been given to an employee, an\nemployee is still entitled to request reinstatement at the end of the leave\nperiod.  The employer must then again determine whether there will be\nsubstantial and grievous economic injury from reinstatement, based on the facts\nat that time.  If the determination remains the same, the employer must notify\nthe employee in writing (in person or by certified mail) of the denial of\nrestoration. (5)  If an employee\non leave does not return to work in response to the employer's notification of its\nintent to deny restoration, the employee continues to be entitled to\nmaintenance of health benefits and the employer may not recover its cost of\nhealth benefit premiums.  A key employee's
