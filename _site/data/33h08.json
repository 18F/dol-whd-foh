  "text": "Name:  Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven metal\nforming, punching, and shearing machines. Originally Adopted:  October 30, 1950 (a)  \nScope of HO 8 (1)  The report establishing HO 8 concluded that\nmetal-forming, punching and shearing machines are dangerous because they\nutilize a heavy crushing or powerful cutting action to perform their work, and\nbecause the operator is required in many cases to place his or her hands close\nto the point of operation in feeding them.  Even with guards and better feeding\nmethods, the report continued, these machines are extremely dangerous.  In\nlight of the preceding and the fact that state child labor laws varied greatly\nand did not reflect “an awareness of the hazards of operating” these machines,\nthe report recommended the establishment of HO 8.  (2)  HO 8 is machine specific and it prohibits the\noperation, helping to operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or\ncleaning power-driven metal forming, punching, and shearing machines.  The\nscope of this HO is narrow and does not include a very large group of metal\nworking machines known as machine tools.  (3)  Definitions a.    \nThe term operator shall mean a\nperson who operates a machine covered by this HO by performing such functions\nas starting or stopping the machine, placing materials into or removing them\nfrom the machine, or any other functions directly involved in operation of the\nmachine.  b.    \nThe term helper shall mean a\nperson who assists in the operation of a machine covered by this HO by helping\nplace materials into or removing them from the machine. c.    \nThe term forming, punching, and\nshearing machines shall mean power-driven metal-working machines, other than\nmachine tools, which change the shape of or cut metal by means of tools, such\nas dies, rolls, or knives which are mounted on rams, plungers, or other moving\nparts. d.    \nA rolling machine is a machine\nused to change the size or shape of metal by running it between rolls under\npressure. e.    \nThe term pressing or punching\nmachines shall mean any machine falling within one of the three following types\nof machines: 1.    \nA punch press is a machine fitted\nwith a ram or plunger and a die for the purpose of blanking, trimming, drawing,\npunching, or stamping metal. 2.    \nA power press is a large, slow\nacting press which performs an operation similar to a punch press, but is intended\nto handle very large or very heavy work. 3.    \nA plate punch is a machine for\npunching holes (such as for rivets) in heavy metal plate. A.   \nA bending machine is a machine for\nbending metal plate between a stationary bed and a moving ram (metal bending\nmachines are known as brakes).  B.   \nA hammering machine is a machine\nwhich employs a ram or plunger to pound the material being worked on into the\ndesired shape. C.   \nA shearing machine is a machine\nfor cutting metal by the shearing action of a movable blade or blades. D.   \nA guillotine shear is a machine\nused for cutting heavy metal plates which consists of a movable upper blade and\na stationary lower blade.  The upper blade comes down vertically to meet the\nlower stationary blade. E.   \nAn alligator shear is a machine\nused for cutting barstock which consists of a movable upper blade and a\nstationary lower blade operating like scissors. F.    \nA circular shear is a machine with\nrevolving disks which cut the material when it passes through the point where\nthe revolving disks meet.  It is used for cutting light metal sheets such as\nthose used in tin cans.   G.   \nMachine tools are power-driven\ncomplete metal-working machines having one or more tool-or work-holding\ndevices, and are used for progressively removing metal in the form of chips. \nThe following are the five principal types of machine tools classified by their\nfunction: i.     \nMilling machine tools consist of\nmachining a piece of metal by bringing it into contact with a rotating cutter\nwith multiple cutting edges.  ii.    \nPlaning machine tools consists of\nmachining a surface by moving the work back and forth under a stationary\ncutting tool.  iii.  \nTurning machine tools consists of\nshaping a rotating piece by means of a cutting tool to generate a cylindrical\nsurface.  iv.  \nBoring machine tools consists of\ncutting a round hole by means of a rotating cutting tool.  v.    \nGrinding machine tools consists of\nshaping a piece by bringing it into contact with a rotating abrasive wheel. (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED All occupations as an operator of, helper on, or in setting up,\nadjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning the following power-driven metal\nforming, punching, and shearing machines:   (1)  All rolling machines such as: beading, straightening,\ncorrugating, flanging, or bending rolls, and hot or cold rolling mills.  (2)  All pressing and punching machines (except as an\noperator or helper on a punch press with automatic feeding and ejection as\ndiscussed in FOH 33h08(c)(1) below) such as: punch press, blanking press,\nforming press, drawing press, stamping press, extrusion press, embossing press,\ncoining press, assembling press, bending press, power press, riveting press,\neyeletting machine, and plate punch.  (3)  All bending machines such as:  apron breaks and press\nbreaks.  (4)  All hammering machines such as:  drop hammer, helve\nhammer, board drop hammer, rope drop hammer, air drop hammer, steam drip\nhammer, power hammer, air hammer, and steam hammer.  (5)  All shearing machines such as:  guillotine shears,\nsquaring shears, alligator shears, and rotary shears.  (c)  \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED (1)  Occupations as an operator of or as helper on a punch\npress equipped with full automatic feed and ejection with a fixed barrier guard\nto prevent the hands or fingers of the operator from entering the area between\nthe dies, power presses, and plate punches.  (2)  HO 8 does not apply to the operation of machine\ntools.  The following is a list of machine tools classified by function: a.    \nMilling machines:  horizontal\nmilling machines, vertical milling machines, universal milling machines,\nplaner-type milling machines, gear cutting machines, profilers, routers, and\ncircular saws (Circular saws are subject to HO 14).  b.    \nPlaning machines:  planers,\nshapers, slotters, broaches, keyseaters, hack and band saws (All band saws are\nsubject to HO 14).  c.    \nTurning machines:  engine lathes,\nturret lathes, hollow spindle lathes, automatic lathes, and automatic screw\nmachines.  d.    \nBoring machines:  vertical boring\nmills, horizontal boring mills, jig borers, drilling machines, pedestal drills,\nradial drills, gang drills, upright drills, drill presses, multiple spindle\ndrills, centering machines, reamers, and honers.  e.    \nGrinding machines:  grinders,\nabrasive wheels, abrasive belts, abrasive discs, abrasive points, buffing\nwheels, polishing wheels, stroppers, and lapping machines (Abrasive cutting\ndiscs are subject to HO 14). (d)  \nExemptions There is a provision in HO 8 for apprentices and student-learners. \nThere are no other exemptions applicable to this order. (e)  \nEnforcement positions (1)  The following is a list of power-driven machines that\nhave been determined to be covered by HO 8: a.    \nAutomatic Bulkan Assembler (the\nBulkan).  This power-driven machine performs a bending or crimping action on\nmetal and is covered by HO 8.  The machine attaches pre-formed metal edged\npaper disks to the top and bottom of cylindrical paper sidewalls.   b.    \nHager press.  This hydraulic\npress, designed to install a broad range of fasteners in flat or pre-formed\nsheet metal assemblies, is covered by HO 8.  c.    \nMetal bottom seamer . This\npower-driven machine performs a rolling and bending action on metal and is\ncovered under HO 8. (2)  The following is a list of power-driven machines that\nhave been determined not to be covered by HO 8: a.    \nWheel crusher or rim removing\nmachine . This machine separates a rim from a tire by using three dies attached\nto three rams to bend the tire and the metal rim.  The rim is circular metal\nstructure specially formed to fit the shape of a wheel, and not a metal plate\nor a flat piece of (sheet) metal as required by the HO.  Moreover, the purpose\nof the machine is to separate the tire from its rim and not to form the rim\ninto another shape (which would be the purpose of a bending machine).  In light\nof the preceding, a wheel crusher is not a bending machine, or any other kind\nof metal forming, punching and shearing machine, and it is not covered by\nHO 8.  b.    \nWalco Precision Roller (series 60\nand 67).  This machine is used to coat metal and other materials with paint,\nvarious adhesives, and other substances.  The machine does not form, shape, or\nreduce the thickness of metal (the function of a rolling machine) and it is not\ncovered by HO 8.  c.    \nInjection molding press.  When\nused to manufacture plastic parts (as opposed to cutting or shaping metal),\nthis machine is not covered by HO 8.  d.    \nFlox wire cut electrical discharge\nmachine.  This machine cuts metal using a brass wire as an electrode.  When the\nwire is brought near metal, an arc is created eroding the metal.  Since this\ntechnology does not cut or shape metal with tools mounted on rams, plungers, or\nother moving parts, it is not a power-driven metal forming, punching or\nshearing machine, and is not covered by HO 8. (3)  The following is a list of machine tools which are not\ncovered by HO 8: a.     Key Duplicating Machines.\nThese machines, often located in hardware stores and other retail\nestablishments, duplicate keys by using a metal cutter.  These machines are\nmachine tools and therefore outside the scope of HO 8.  An example of a key\nduplicating machine that has been determined to be a machine tool is the Axxess\nPC key machine (serial #0595187FP). b.     Ridgid 535 pipe and bolt\nthreading machine. This machine is classified as machine tool and not a\nshearing machine, even though the cutting knife has a rotary motion.  Since it is\na machine tool, it is not covered by HO 8.  c.     Landis pipe nipple and\nautomatic pipe nipple machines. These machines are considered to be machine\ntools and not covered under HO 8.  d.     Brake drum and brake\ndisc lathes .These lathes (used to repair brakes in automotive and truck repair\nshops) are turning machines and are considered machine tools.  They are outside\nthe scope of HO 8. e.     Pipe threading equipment.\nTurning machines, such as the Rigid Model 1234 Threading Machine, are machine\ntools and not covered under HO 8.",
