  "text": "Under\nReg 553.222(c), where an employer and employee had agreed that time spent\nsleeping be compensable, the employer cannot make unilateral changes in the\nagreement in order to exclude sleep time from compensable hours of work and\nthen consider the employee’s continued employment to be acceptance of such\nchange. Some form of uncoerced mutual assent is necessary to consider the\nparties’ agreement validly changed. Reg\n553.222(c) does not address the converse, i.e., the procedure for making sleep\ntime compensable where there was previously an expressed or implied agreement\nto exclude such time from compensable hours of work. Consequently, an employee\ncould unilaterally withdraw his/her consent and the employer would then be\nrequired to compensate the employee for any future sleep time that may occur.\nHowever, the employer would not be required to agree to a continuation of the\nsame terms and conditions of employment. The employer and employee would be\nfree to establish new conditions of employment, such as rate of pay, hours of\nwork, or reassignment. Where employees are represented for collective\nbargaining purposes, such changes in the terms or conditions of employment\ncould be addressed within the collective bargaining process. Non-represented\nemployees would be left to private agreement between the employer and\nthemselves.",
