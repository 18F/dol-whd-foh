  "title": "12c02 - “Business done”\ndefined.",
  "text": "(a)           \nThe 1966 Amendments added the\nphrase “or business done” to the term “annual gross volume of sales made” in\nSec 3(s)(1) to reflect more clearly the economic test of business size\npreviously expressed in the Act in terms of “annual gross volume of sales”. It\nis intended by this test to measure the size of an enterprise for purposes of\nenterprise coverage in terms of the ADV in dollars (exclusive of specified\ntaxes) of the business transactions of the enterprise, regardless of whether such\ntransactions are “sales” in a technical sense. Based on language contained in\nthe Congressional Reports, the measure is intended to be applied to business\ntransactions with the customers of the enterprise, or with the persons who\npurchase property or services of any kind through transactions with the\nenterprise, in terms of the gross price they pay for whatever they obtain as a\nresult of the transaction; no intent appears to measure “business done” by\nadding to such amounts the sums paid out by the enterprise as business\nexpenses. For example, gross dollar volume from “business done” will include\nthe gross amounts paid by the tenants or users as consideration for the leasing\nor rental of property to them by the enterprise. On the other hand,\nexpenditures made by the enterprise such as rental payments, mortgage payments,\ninterest payments on loans, and accounts payable will be excluded in computing\ngross volume of sales made and business done. (b)          \nIn applying Sec 3(s)(1), the ADV\nof an enterprise is deemed to include the gross volume of the “sales” which it\nmakes, as defined in Sec 3(k) of the Act (see IB 779.259), and/or the gross\nvolume of its “business done” as explained in (a) above; that is, the gross\ndollar volume of any other business activity in which the enterprise engaged\nwhich can similarly be measured on a dollar basis.",
