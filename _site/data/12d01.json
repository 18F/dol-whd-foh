  "text": "(a)           \nEnterprises not 3(s)(2) covered on\n6/30/78: (Some effects of changes in the ADV under Sec 3(s)(2) on coverage of\nretail or service enterprises are illustrated below. See also FOH 21a01.) (1)  A new retail or service enterprise beginning business\nafter 6/30/78 is not covered until its ADV reaches the applicable statutory\namount contained in Sec 3(s)(2) ($362,500 effective 1/1/82). (2)  If such an enterprise had an ADV of less than $250,000\non 6/30/78, it was not a covered Sec 3(s)(2) enterprise. This lack of coverage\nunder Sec 3(s)(2) continues if the enterprise never attains an ADV which would\ncover it under Sec 3(s)(2) ($362,500 since 1/1/82). (3)  However, if such an enterprise’s ADV increases so that\nit equals or exceeds the $362,500 ADV test currently in effect, the enterprise\nmust begin paying MW and OT at the time coverage becomes applicable. (4)  If the ADV later falls below $362,500, the enterprise\nwould not be covered and would remain so until the ADV again increases to the\n$362,500 level at which time the enterprise would again be covered under Sec\n3(s)(2) (b)          \nEnterprises 3(s)(2) covered on\n6/30/78: Some effects of changes in the ADV of a Sec 3(s)(2) enterprise which is\n“grandfathered” under Sec 3(s) are illustrated below: (1)  Enterprise coverage under the grandfather clause at\nthe end of Sec 3(s) cannot be asserted unless the enterprise was covered on\n6/30/78. The language of Sec 3(s) expressly requires that in order to be\ngrandfathered an enterprise must have been covered on 6/30/78. (2)  By way of illustration, if, during the period 7/1/78\nto 6/30/80, a retail enterprise had an ADV of at least $275,000, and its ADV\nsubsequently falls below $275,000 (but remains at least $250,000), the MW\neffective for that enterprise reverts to $2.65 an hour (the MW in effect on the\nday before the statutory ADV increased to $275,000). This MW remains in effect\nfor the enterprise until its ADV falls below $250,000, or until its ADV once\nagain reaches a statutory ADV level which requires payment of a higher MW. This\nis illustrated below: \n\n\n \n  \n  6/30/77\n  \n  \n  ADV\n  \n  \n  $250,000 – MW\n  \n  \n  $2.65\n  \n \n \n  \n  9/1/78\n  \n  \n  ADV\n  \n  \n  $275,000 – MW\n  \n  \n  $2.65\n  \n \n \n  \n  1/1/79\n  \n  \n  ADV\n  \n  \n  $275,000 – MW\n  \n  \n  $2.90\n  \n \n \n  \n  7/1/80\n  \n  \n  ADV\n  \n  \n  $250,000 – MW\n  \n  \n  $2.65\n  \n \n \n  \n  3/31/81\n  \n  \n  ADV\n  \n  \n  $325,000 – MW\n  \n  \n  $3.35\n  \n \n \n  \n  3/31/82\n  \n  \n  ADV\n  \n  \n  $245,000 – not covered\n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n\n\n The enterprise remains removed from coverage until it again reaches the\nSec 3(s)(2) statutory ADV currently in effect: \n\n\n \n  \n  3/31/83\n  \n  \n  ADV\n  \n  \n  325,000 - not covered\n  \n \n \n  \n  3/31/84\n  \n  \n  ADV\n  \n  \n  362,500 - MW $3.35 beginning 4/1/84\n  \n \n\n\n (3)  To further illustrate, if the ADV of a retail or\nservice enterprise (which was covered on 6/30/78) was $300,000 on 7/1/80, and\nthe enterprise became noncovered because of the increase in the statutory\nstandard on that date ($325,000), it would be required to continue to pay an MW\nof 3.10 per hour until such time as the ADV of the enterprise met a later\nstatutory level ($325,000 from 7/1/80 to 12/31/81; $362,500 after 12/31/81). At\nsuch time as the ADV of the enterprise reached the later statutory level, it would\nbe required to pay the MW in effect at that time ($3.35 per hour since\n12/31/80). Once its ADV has risen to a later statutory level, the enterprise would\nbe required to continue to pay the applicable MW until such time as its ADV\nfalls below that level. Thereafter, it would be required to pay (1) whatever MW\nwas applicable “on the day before the statutory change took effect,” and (2)\nproper OT. For example, if an enterprise having an ADV of $362,500 fell to an\nADV of $300,000, its applicable MW would become $3.10 an hour, which was the\nstatutory MW in effect on 6/30/80, the day before the statutory ADV level rose\nto $325,000. If on the other hand, the ADV of the enterprise falls below $250,000,\nit would cease to be covered until such time as its ADV rose to at least the\ncurrent level of $362,500. (c)           \nCertain special problems which\nhave arisen from the application of the grandfather clause are as follows: (1)  A hotel or motel enterprise which is grandfathered\nunder Sec 3(s)(2) cannot pay OT based on the old partial OT exemption formerly\ncontained in Sec 13(b)(8) notwithstanding the fact that Sec 13(b)(8) was in\neffect at the time the enterprise was grandfathered. Sec 3(s) states that a\nretail or service enterprise which is grandfathered shall pay its employees in\naccordance with Sec 7. There is no implication that any exemptions which were\nrepealed are to apply currently to grandfathered enterprises because the\nexemption may have been applicable on 6/30/78, or thereafter. (2)  Retail or service enterprises which are grandfathered\nunder Sec 3(s)(2) cannot take a tip credit higher than that currently in effect\n(40%).   There is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that the higher\ntip credits which were available to employers prior to 1/1/79 or 1/1/80 are currently\nto be made available to grandfathered enterprises. For example, if $3.10 continues to be the MW applicable to a\ngrandfathered enterprise, the employer would be entitled to a tip credit not to\nexceed 40% of $3.10, that is, $1.24 per hour.
