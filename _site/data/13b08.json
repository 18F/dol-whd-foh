  "text": "(a)   A Purchase Notice Agreement (PNA) is a written\ncontract between a supplier and a Government agency under which the supplier\nlists its products and offers to sell them to the Government at certain prices.\nAs needs develop, the agency in turn submits a purchase order to one or another\nof the suppliers with whom it has executed such an agreement. Upon receipt of\nthe order, the supplier fills it either from its existing stocks, by producing\nthe goods, by purchase from other sources, or by some combination of means.\nThis type of contract is often used by the Department of Defense to procure\nperishable and nonperishable subsistence items, such as dairy products, bakery\nproducts, and canned foods. (b)  Purchase Notice Agreements are “contracts” for purpose\nof the PCA and the PCA applies as in the case of any other indefinite amount\ncontract if the aggregate total of purchases (excluding perishables, R&I\nNo. 3, Sec 11) pursuant to the agreement may exceed $10,000, even though no\nsingle purchase may exceed this amount. Further the “open market” exemption\ndoes not apply in such cases (R&I No. 3, Sec 13). (c)   Where, under the PNA, the contractor is providing the\nGovernment with goods which are identifiable as to the time the work on them is\nperformed, the stock-on-hand rule in Sec 24(a) of R&I No. 3 rather than the\nstockpile rule in Sec 24(b) governs. The stock-on-hand rule permits the\ncontractor to fill the Government order, if it can, from goods produced or\nprocured prior to the award of its contract. Under it, while the Act does not\napply retroactively to work performed prior to the award of the PNA contract,\nit does apply as stated in paragraph (d) following, to work performed after the\ndate of the award of the PNA contract on the materials or articles supplied to\nthe Government. (d)  All work performed after the Government gives notice\nto the contractor of award of the PNA, on goods which the contractor knows or\ncan anticipate with reasonable certainty at the time the work is done will be\nsupplied to the Government under the PNA, must be performed in compliance with\nthe representations and stipulations contained in the Act and incorporated in\nthe PNA. However, as stated in Sec 22 of R&I No. 3, the necessity of\ncompliance with the representations and stipulations is confined to the period\nof actual engagement in work on the contract, “provided the records of the\ncontractor adequately disclose the period during which Government work is being\nperformed”. Thus, if, after notice by the Government of award of a PNA, the\ncontractor performs work on goods embraced within its terms which the\ncontractor knows will not be used to fill purchase orders thereunder, the\ncontractor may perform the work on such goods without the necessity of\ncompliance with the Act’s stipulations and representations, provided its\nrecords are adequate to segregate such work from Government work. But with\nrespect to work on any goods which, at the time of performance of such work,\nthe contractor knows or has reason to believe will be furnished to the\nGovernment in response to purchase orders issued under the PNA, compliance\nduring the period while such goods are being worked on is required without\nregard to whether the purchase order under which the goods will actually be\nfurnished to the Government has been issued. (e)   It will be noted that under paragraph (d) the date of\naward for purposes of the stock-on-hand rule is the date of award of the PNA\nrather than of the particular purchase order under it. As provided in Sec 22 of\nR&I No. 3, compliance with the representations and stipulations of the Act\nand regulations is required during all of “the period in which the contractor\nis actually engaged in the performance of work on the contract”. The period in\nwhich the contractor is so engaged will necessarily include any period after\nissuance of a purchase order under the PNA during which work is performed on\nthe specific goods supplied under that purchase order. The reason for this,\nhowever, is not because the date of the purchase order, rather than the date of\nthe PNA, is the date of the award of the contract. The controlling factor is\nthat at such time there can be no room for doubt that the contractor is\nactually engaged in the performance of work “on the contract” embodied in the\nPNA. With respect to work done on goods after notice of the PNA but before issuance\nof the purchase order which is filled with such goods, a careful evaluation of\nall the facts should be made to determine whether the contractor actually knew\nor could anticipate with reasonable certainty at the time such work was\nperformed that the goods worked on would be supplied to the Government under\nthe PNA. (f)   In any case when the application of this instruction\nis not clear, the matter shall be submitted through channels to the RS for\nopinion. Because of the complex issues, the Field should proceed very carefully\nin cases involving PNA’s.",
