  "text": "(a)   Installation work performed in conjunction with supply\nor service (e.g., base support) contracts is covered by the DBRA where it\ninvolves more than an incidental amount of construction activity (i.e., the\ncontract contains specific requirements for substantial amounts of\nconstruction, reconstruction, alteration, or repair work, and such work is\nphysically or functionally separate from and can be performed on a segregated\nbasis from the other nonconstruction work called for by the contract (see 29\nCFR § 4.116(c)(2)). For example, D‑B coverage has been extended to installing a\nsecurity system or an intrusion detection system, installing permanent shelving\nwhich is attached to a structure, installing air-conditioning ducts, excavating\noutside cable trenches and laying cable, installing heavy generators, mounting\nradar antenna, and installing instrumentation grounding systems, where a\nsubstantial amount of construction work is involved. (b)  Whether installation work involves more than an\nincidental amount of construction activity depends upon the specific\ncircumstances of each particular case and no fixed rules can be established\nwhich would address every fact situation. Factors requiring consideration\ninclude the nature of the prime contract work, the type of work performed by\nthe employees installing the equipment on the project site (i.e., the\ntechniques, materials, and equipment used and the skills called for in its\nperformance), the extent to which structural modifications to buildings are\nneeded to accommodate the equipment (such as widening entrances, relocating\nwalls, or installing wiring), and the cost of the installation work, either in\nterms of absolute amount or in relation to the cost of the equipment and the\ntotal project cost. (c)  \nDBRA does not apply to\nconstruction work which is incidental to the furnishing of supplies or\nequipment, if the construction work is so merged with nonconstruction work or\nso fragmented in terms of the locations or time spans of its performance that\nthe construction work is not capable of being segregated as a separate\ncontractual requirement.\n15e - INTERPRETATIONS - APPLICATION OF DBRA TO TYPES OF EMPLOYEES",
