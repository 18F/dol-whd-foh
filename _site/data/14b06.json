  "text": "(a)   The amount of the contract is not determinative of the\nAct’s coverage although the statutory requirements and the contract clauses are\ndifferent for contracts in excess of $2,500 and for contracts of a lesser\namount. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.159.) (b)  Contracts exceeding $2,500. In every covered contract in\nexcess of $2,500 or with no definite amount, the agency is required to include\nthe SCA labor standards contract clauses set forth in 29 C.F.R. § 4.6. In\naddition to other matters, such as R/K requirements and a summary of\nliabilities and penalties for violations, these clauses contain the basic\nprovisions of Sections 2(a)(1) through (4) of the Act relating to: payment of\nprevailing MW rates, furnishing of FBs, observance of S&H standards, and\nnotice of compensation to employees (posting). In the absence of a WD attached\nto the contract specifying the prevailing rate or rates to be paid and the FBs\nto be furnished, the clauses also provide that neither the prime contractor nor\nany subcontractor shall pay any employees performing work on the contract less\nthan the MW required by Section 6(a)(1) of the FLSA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6, 4.150,\n4.159.) (c)   The labor standards contract clauses included in the\nprime contract are by their terms required to be included as well in any\nsubcontract or any lower tier subcontract made thereunder. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.114,\n4.151.) (d)  Contracts not exceeding $2,500. The only clause required in\nFederal service contracts of $2,500 or less is the clause reflecting the basic\nprovisions of Section 2(b)(1) of the SCA relating to the payment of the MW\nrequired by Section 6(a)(1) of the FLSA to employees engaged in performing work\non the contract. However, pursuant to Section 18 of the FLSA, no provision of\nthe FLSA shall excuse noncompliance with any federal, state or local law\nestablishing a MW higher than the FLSA MW. WHD staff will not interpret or\nenforce any law other than those administered by the WHD, and States cannot\ninterpret or enforce the SCA or FLSA. (See 41 U.S.C. 351(b)(1); 29 C.F.R.\n4.150; FOH 32j01.) (e)   Determining contract amount. The value of the contract is\ndetermined by either the amount to be paid for the service or the amount which\nthe contractor receives for providing the service. For example, concession\ncontracts are considered to be contracts in excess of $2,500 if the\ncontractor's gross receipts under the contract may exceed $2,500. (See 29\nC.F.R. 4.141.)  (f)   CWHSSA contract clauses. Any federal contract in\nexcess of $100,000 that requires or involves the employment of “laborers” and\n“mechanics,” including “watchmen” and guards, is subject to the  overtime\nprovisions of CWHSSA. Such contracts, which may include SCA-covered contracts\nthat employ many classes of service employees that fall within the terms \n“laborers” and “mechanics,” should include CWHSSA’s contract clauses set forth\nin  29 C.F.R. 5.5(b). However, failure to incorporate the CWHSSA contract\nclauses into a contract does not preclude CWHSSA coverage. (See SCA 29 C.F.R.\n4.181(b); Davis-Bacon Act (DBA) 29 C.F.R. 5.5(b); FOH 15g02.)",
