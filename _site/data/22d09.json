  "text": "(a)  \nA substitute teacher may qualify for the professional\nexemption if the duties test is met.  Certain\nstates do not require substitute teachers to have a college degree or teaching\ncertificate.  Instead,\na state, for example, may indicate that a person wishing to work as a\nsubstitute teacher need only meet certain other requirements, such as obtaining\na substitute teaching permit, having completed a requisite number of college\nsemester hours, or having obtained an associate's degree from a regionally or\nnationally accredited institution; or having obtained a high school diploma or\nG.E.D. certificate, and completing 24 hours of in-service training and ten\nhours of classroom observation.  Substitute\nteachers qualify for the professional exemption if their primary duty is\nteaching and imparting knowledge in an educational establishment. On the other\nhand, substitute teachers whose primary duties are not related to teaching—for\nexample, performing general clerical or administrative tasks for the school\nunrelated to teaching their assigned students, or manual labor—do not qualify\nfor the professional exemption. The term \"educational establishment\"\nincludes \"an elementary or secondary school system, an institution of\nhigher education or other educational institution.\"  A\nsubstitute teacher with a teaching certificate clearly qualifies for the professional\nexemption. However, private schools and public schools are not uniform in\nrequiring a certificate for employment as an elementary or secondary school\nteacher, and a teacher’s certificate is not generally necessary for employment\nin institutions of higher education or other educational establishments.\nTherefore, a teacher who is not certified may be considered for exemption,\nprovided that such individual is employed as a teacher by the employing school\nor school system. Further, there is no minimum educational or academic degree\nrequirement for bona fide teaching professionals in educational institutions.\nEmployees working as substitute teachers are within the teaching professional\nexemption whether or not they possess an advanced academic degree so long as\nteaching is their primary duty.  WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2008-07 WHD\nLetter FLSA 2005-39NA WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2006-41 WHD\nLetter FLSA 2005-39NA 29\nCFR § 541.204(b)29\nCFR § 541.303(c)  (b) \nSubstitute kindergarten teachers. Substitute\nteachers in a public school system may qualify for the teacher exemption in 29 CFR\n§ 541.303 provided that their primary duty is teaching as defined therein.
