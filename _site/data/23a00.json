The exemption would apply, for example, where none of the circulation\nis within the county in which a newspaper is published provided a major part of\nits circulation is within contiguous counties. A “contiguous county”, for\npurposes of Sec 13(a)(8), means a county which at some point shares a common\nboundary with the county in which the newspaper is published. “Contiguous\ncounties” need not be in the same State.",
