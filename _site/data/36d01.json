  "text": "The field sanitation facilities must be provided at\nno cost to the employee (see 29 CFR 1928.110(c)). Employers who charge for field sanitation facilities\nare subject to citation and penalties under the OSHAct.  Where the evidence\nsupports a finding that an employer charged the cost for providing required\nfacilities to the employees, the WHI should inform the employer that such\ncharges are unlawful and seek restitution for the affected workers. In addition, charging for field sanitation facilities\nviolates the FLSA obligation to pay the minimum wage if it takes the employee’s\nwages below FLSA MW in a non-overtime workweek; such deductions cannot be made\nin overtime workweeks to an employee who is entitled to FLSA OT compensation\n(e.g. potentially reforestation workers) (see FOH32j08).  The same principle\napplies to H-2A covered workers: such deductions cannot take H-2A covered\nworkers below the H-2A required wage; in addition to a potential wage\nviolation, it may also be failure to comply with other laws.  If the cost is\npassed on to the workers via deduction from pay, it may be a violation of MSPA’s\nobligation to pay wages owed when due since illegal deductions cannot be taken. \nA MSPA violation for failing to disclose all terms and conditions of employment\nmay also exist if the workers were not properly notified of the cost to the\nworkers (albeit illegal) for the facilities.  Whether such a charge constitutes\nan impermissible deduction under other laws and regulations enforced by the WHD\nshall be determined based upon the requirements of the law and regulation. 29 CFR 1928.110(c)",
