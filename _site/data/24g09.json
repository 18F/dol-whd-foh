Thus, motorbus carriers engaged in\ncontractual hauling of goods or persons are not within the exemption since\nthese services are not rendered to the public at large as part of the available\ntransportation facilities. (b)   Those employees who perform the\ncontractual hauling activities of a motorbus carrier, whether such hauling be\nof persons or property, are performing nonexempt work under Sec l3(b)(7) (and\nwere performing nonexempt work under old Sec l3(b)(7) and old Sec 13(a)(9)).",
