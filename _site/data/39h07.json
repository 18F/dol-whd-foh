The certification may be completed by: (1)  A Department of\nDefense (DOD) health care provider, (2)  A Department of\nVeterans Affairs (VA) health care provider, (3)  A DOD TRICARE\nnetwork authorized private health care provider, (4)  A DOD\nnon-network TIRCARE authorized private health care provider, or (5)  A health care\nprovider as defined in 29 CFR 825.125. The authorized health\ncare provider may rely on determinations from an authorized DOD or VA\nrepresentative for certain military-related determinations. (b)   An\nemployer may request the following information for military caregiver leave\ncertification: (1)  The name,\naddress, and appropriate contact information (telephone number, fax     number,\nand/or email address) of the health care provider, the type of medical\npractice, the medical specialty, and whether the health care provider is one of\nthe health care providers specified in FOH 39h07(a), (2)  Whether the\ncovered servicemember’s injury or illness was incurred in the line of duty\nwhile on active duty or, if not, whether the covered servicemember’s injury or\nillness existed before the beginning of the servicemember’s active duty and was\naggravated by service in the line of duty while on active duty, (3)  The approximate\ndate on which the serious injury or illness commenced, or was aggravated, and\nits probable duration, (4)  A statement of\nappropriate medical facts regarding the covered servicemember’s health\ncondition, sufficient to support the need for leave, a.     Current\nmember of the Armed Forces For a current member\nof the Armed Forces, such medical facts must include information on whether the\ninjury or illness may render the covered servicemember medically unfit to\nperform the duties of the servicemember’s office, grade, rank, or rating and\nwhether the member is receiving medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy. b.     Veteran For a covered\nveteran, such medical facts must include information on whether the veteran is\nreceiving medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for an injury or illness\nthat: 1.     Is\nthe continuation of a serious injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated\nwhen the covered veteran was a member of the Armed Forces and that rendered the\nmember medically unfit to perform the duties of the member’s office, grade,\nrank, or rating, or 2.     Is\na physical or mental condition for which the covered veteran has received a VA\nService-Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50 percent or greater.  The VASRD\nrating must be based, in whole or in part, on the condition for which the need\nfor military caregiver leave is requested, or 3.     Is\na physical or mental condition that substantially impairs the covered veteran’s\nability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of a\ndisability or disabilities related to military service, or would do so absent\ntreatment, or 4.     Is\nsubstantiated by documentation of enrollment in the Department of Veterans\nAffairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. (5)  Information\nsufficient to establish that the covered servicemember is in need of care, as\ndescribed in 29 CFR 825.124, and whether the covered servicemember will need\ncare for a single continuous period of time, including any time for treatment\nand recovery, and an estimate as to the beginning and ending dates for this\nperiod of time, (6)  If an employee\nrequests leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis for planned medical\ntreatment appointments for the covered servicemember, whether there is a\nmedical necessity for the covered servicemember to have such periodic care, and\nan estimate of the treatment schedule for such appointments, (7)  If an employee\nrequests leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis to care for a\ncovered servicemember other than for planned medical treatment, whether there\nis a medical necessity for the covered servicemember to have such periodic\ncare, which can include assisting in the covered servicemember’s recovery, and\nan estimate of the frequency and duration of the periodic care, (8)  Name and\naddress of the employee requesting leave, the name of the covered\nservicemember, and the relationship of the employee to the covered servicemember, (9)  Whether the\ncovered servicemember is a current member of the Armed Forces and his or her\nmilitary branch, rank, and current unit assignment, and if so, whether he or\nshe is assigned to a military medical facility as an outpatient or to a unit\nestablished for the purpose of providing command and control of members of the\nArmed Forces received medical care as outpatients, and the name of the medical\ntreatment facility or unit, or whether he or she is on the temporary disability\nretired list, and (10)  Whether the\ncovered servicemember is a veteran, the date of separation from military\nservice, and whether the separation was other than dishonorable. An employer may use\nthe DOL’s optional form WH-385 for current servicemembers or form WH-385-V for\ncovered veterans.  An employer who uses form WH-385 or WH-385-V or another form\ncontaining the same basic information may not require any information beyond\nthat specified in the regulations.  See 29 CFR 825.310(b) and (c) for\nthe information permitted on the certification. (c)   When an\nemployer requires an employee to submit certification to support military\ncaregiver leave, the employer is required to accept a copy of Invitational\nTravel Orders (ITO) or an Invitational Travel Authorization (ITA) in place of\nthe certification.  The ITO/ITA is sufficient certification for the duration of\ntime specified in the ITO/ITA and regardless of whether the employee is named\nin the order or authorization.  If the employee’s need for leave extends beyond\nthe period covered by the ITO/ITA, an employer may request certification for\nthe remainder of the leave period.  The employer may require the employee to\nprovide confirmation of the family relationship between the employee and the\ncovered servicemember. (d)   When an\nemployer requires the employee to submit certification to support military\ncaregiver leave, the employer is required to accept a copy of the covered\nservicemember’s enrollment in the Department of Veterans Affairs Program of\nComprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers as certification of the\nservicemember’s serious injury or illness.  The enrollment documentation is\nsufficient certification of the servicemember’s serious injury or illness\nregardless of whether the employee is the named caregiver in the enrollment\ndocumentation. The employee is still\nresponsible for providing the employer with additional relevant information,\nsuch as that the veteran is within five years of discharge, the probable\nduration of the serious injury or illness, and the veteran’s need for care and\nan estimate of the time period during which care will be needed.  The employer\nmay require the employee to provide confirmation of the family relationship\nbetween the employee and the covered servicemember. 78 FR 8858 (e)   An\nemployer may seek authentication and clarification of a certification for\nmilitary caregiver leave, including authentication and clarification of an\nITO/ITA or the documentation indicating a servicemember’s enrollment in the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family\nCaregivers.  See 29 CFR 825.307. (f)   An\nemployer may require second and/or third opinions when leave to care for a\ncovered servicemember is certified by a non-military affiliated health care\nprovider, as described in FOH 39h07(a).  An employer may not require second\nand/or third opinions for leave to care for a covered servicemember when the\nleave is certified by a military-affiliated health care provider as described\nin FOH 39h07(a).  Additionally, the recertification process does not apply to\nleave taken to care for a covered servicemember. 29 CFR 825.310",
