  "text": "(a)           \nSec 3(r) does not require unified\noperation if there is common control. Further, common ownership may in certain\nsituations be sufficient to establish the common control required by the Act\n(see IB 779.215 and 779.222). It does not necessarily follow, however, that the\nactivities which are thus commonly controlled are related and performed through\nsuch common control for a common business purpose so as to bring them all\nwithin a single enterprise. A determination as to whether or not these tests\nare met requires that the total situation be considered and that each of the tests\nbe viewed realistically in the context of the others rather than solely in\nisolation. (b)          \nWhile the facts in each case will\nbe determinative of whether the tests of Sec 3(r) are met, the following\nexcerpts from recent opinions will serve to illustrate the application of the\nprinciples set out in (a) above in situations where common ownership was a\nfactor to be considered. (1)  A parent corporation, characterized as a holding\ncompany or finance and investment group, owns and controls numerous subsidiary\ncorporations. The latter are engaged, respectively, in such diversified\nactivities as retail hardware, animal feed manufacture, building management,\nmortgage loans, steel container manufacture, and so on. The opinion stated: “A\nholding corporation may be organized and operated for investment purposes and\nthe facts may show in a particular case that the activities of its operating\nsubsidiaries are not actually related activities performed through common\ncontrol for a common business purpose but are separately performed for\ndifferent corporate purposes contained in the separate corporate charters. A\ndifferent situation would be presented, of course, if it appeared that the\nholding company, under authority of its charter, was in fact performing with\nits subsidiaries through common control a combination of related activities in\nwhich the various corporations are engaged, and that such activities were all\nrelated to, and performed for, a unitary business purpose for which the holding\ncompany was formed and which is common to all such activities”. (2)  Two brothers live, respectively, in cities A and B.\nThey have for several years owned a retail grocery supermarket, as equal\npartners. This supermarket is operated by a manager who is in active charge of\nthe store. One of the brothers individually purchased an operating grocery\nstore in another town. This store is operated by a full-time manager who makes\ndaily reports to the owner brother. He makes no reports to the other brother.\nThe operation of the two stores is not unified in any way. An issue was raised\nas to whether the activities of the two stores are related activities performed\nfor a common business purpose. The opinion stated: “The activities in question\nare related in kind, since they are those of retail stores. The question\nremains, however, as to whether they are, within the meaning of Sec 3(r),\nrelated activities performed through common control for a common business\npurpose. It is true, as stated in IB 779.212, that the term “common business\npurpose” as used in Sec 3(r) does not have a narrow concept and is not intended\nto be limited to a single business establishment or a single type of business.\nBut where, as here, there are related activities having no functional\ninterdependence and they are separately conducted to serve the business purpose\nof the partnership on the one hand and the business purpose of one brother\nindividually on the other, we are not prepared to say that the requirement of\nperformance ‘through common control’ of ‘related activities’ for a ‘common business\npurpose’ is sufficiently met”.",
