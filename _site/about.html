      <h1>Wage and Hour Division (WHD)</h1>
      <h2>Field Operations Handbook</h2>
      <p>WHD field staff relies on the FOH for our agency’s guidance with regulatory interpretations, enforcement policies, and administrative procedures.  Having access to accurate information is extremely important, especially during a period when we are experiencing so much change (tipped employees, homecare, definition of spouse under FMLA, H-2A and MSPA CMPs, H-2B vacatur, etc.).  As an agency, we have to do a better job at getting this information into the hands of our field staff who are responsible for enforcing the law and providing sound technical assistance to stakeholders.</p>
      <p>WHD investigators and staff are personally responsible for maintaining and updating their personal FOH copies.  An overwhelming number of respondents in the recent FOH survey voiced a low-confidence rating when asked whether they believed their FOH was up-to-date. Some respondents further questioned whether the online FOH is up-to-date. Furthermore, the electronic version is visually difficult to read (in some cases, pages are photocopies of photocopies), and as images rather than readable text, the FOH is difficult to navigate. FOH survey results indicate that users are frustrated that they cannot search for keywords in the electronic version or navigate to referenced source materials.  In its current state, the online FOH is not user-friendly.  As a result, WHD staff underutilize this resource.</p>
      <p>This workgroup believes that an improved, modern, and efficient electronic FOH will restore WHD field staffs’ trust and confidence in the guidance therein.  This project’s end goal is to create an electronic FOH that is easy to navigate and encourages use.  This first phase has created a visually appealing website that is easy to read, searchable by keywords, and contains links to FOH sections as well as outside regulatory and statutory sites.</p>
