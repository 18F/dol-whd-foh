<h3>10a00 - Purpose of chapter.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>FOH Chapter
10 contains interpretations regarding the employment relationship required for
FLSA to apply, the geographical limits of the Act’s applicability, and
employment which is specifically excluded from coverage under the Act. These
coverage concepts are equally applicable to activities which constitute
engagement in or production for interstate or foreign commerce and to employment
in an enterprise described in Sec 3(s)</p>

<h3>10b00 - Employment relationship required for FLSA to
apply.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In order for
the FLSA to apply there must be an employee-employer relationship. This
requires an “employer” and “employee” and the act or condition of employment.
FLSA Secs 3(d), (e) and (g) define the terms “employer”, “employee”, and
“employ”.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b01 - FLSA employment relationship distinguished
from the common law concept.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The courts
have made it clear that the employment relationship under the FLSA is broader
than the traditional common law concept of the master and servant relationship.
The difference between the FLSA employment relationship and the common law
employment relationship arises from the FLSA statement that “Employ includes to
suffer or permit to work”. The courts have indicated that, while “to permit”
requires a more positive action than “to suffer”, both terms imply much less
positive action than required by the common law. Mere knowledge by an employer
of work done for him or her by another is sufficient to create the employment
relationship under the FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b02 - Method of compensation not material.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The fact
that no compensation is paid and the worker is dependent entirely on tips does
not negate his/her status as an employee, if other indications of employment
are present. If the worker is paid, the fact that he or she is paid by the
piece or by the job or on a percentage or commission basis rather than on the
basis of work time does not preclude a determination that the worker is, on the
facts, an employee with respect to the work for which such compensation is
received.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b03 - Religious, charitable, and nonprofit
organizations, schools institutions, volunteer workers, member of religious orders.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
There is no special provision in the FLSA which precludes an
employee-employer relationship between a religious, charitable or nonprofit
organization and persons who perform work for such an organization. For
example, a church or religious order may operate an establishment to print
books, magazines, or other publications and employ a regular staff who do this
work as a means of livelihood. In such cases there is an employee-employer
relationship for purposes of the Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
Persons such as nuns, monks, priests, lay brothers, ministers,
deacons, and other members of religious orders who serve pursuant to their
religious obligations in the schools, hospitals, and other institutions
operated by their church or religious order shall not be considered to be “employees”.
However, the fact that such a person is a member of a religious order does not
preclude an employee-employer relationship with a State or secular institution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
In many cases the nature of religious, charitable and similar
nonprofit organizations, and schools is such that individuals may volunteer
their services in one capacity or another, usually on a part-time basis, not as
employees or in contemplation of pay for the services rendered. For example,
members of civic organizations may help out in a sheltered workshop; women’s
organizations may send members or students into hospitals or nursing homes to
provide certain personal services for the sick or the elderly; mothers may
assist in a school library or cafeteria as a public duty to maintain effective
services for their children; or fathers may drive a school bus to carry a
football team or band on a trip. Similarly, individuals may volunteer to
perform such tasks as driving vehicles or folding bandages for the Red Cross,
working with children with disabilities or disadvantaged youth, helping in
youth programs as camp counselors, scoutmasters, den mothers, providing child
care assistance for needy working mothers, soliciting contributions or
participating in benefit programs for such organizations and volunteering other
services needed to carry out their charitable, educational, or religious
programs. The fact that services are performed under such circumstances is not
sufficient to create an employee-employer relationship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)           
Although the volunteer services (as described in (c) above) are
not considered to create an employment relationship, the organizations for
which they are performed will generally also have employees performing
compensated service whose employment is subject to the standards of the Act.
Where such an employment relationship exists, the Act requires payment of not
less than the statutory wages for all hours “worked” in the w/w. However, there
are certain circumstances where such an employee may donate services as a
volunteer, and the time so spent is not considered to be compensable “work”.
For example, an office employee of a hospital may volunteer to sit with a sick
child or elderly person during off-duty hours as an act of charity. WH will not
consider that an employee-employer relationship exists with respect to such
volunteer time between the establishment and the volunteer or between the
volunteer and the person for whose benefit the service is performed. Another
example is where an office employee of a church may volunteer to perform
non-clerical services in the church preschool during off duty time from his or
her office work as an act of charity. Conversely, a preschool employee may
volunteer to perform work in some other facet of the church’s operations
without an employment relationship being formed with respect to such volunteer
time. However, this does not mean that a regular office employee of a
charitable organization can volunteer services on an uncompensated basis to
handle correspondence in connection with a special fund drive or to handle
other work arising from exigencies of the operations conducted by the employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)           
As part of their overall educational program, public or private
schools and institutions of higher learning may permit or require students to
engage in activities in connection with dramatics, student publications, glee
clubs, bands, choirs, debating teams, radio stations, intramural and
interscholastic athletics and other similar endeavors. Activities of students
in such programs, conducted primarily for the benefit of the participants as a
part of the educational opportunities provided to the students by the school or
institution, are not “work” of the kind contemplated by Sec 3(g) of the Act and
do not result in an employee-employer relationship between the student and the
school or institution. Also, the fact that a student may receive a minimal
payment for participation is such activities would not necessarily create an
employment relationship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)           
The sole fact that a student helps in a school lunchroom or
cafeteria for periods of 30 minutes to an hour per day in exchange for their
lunch is not considered to be sufficient to make him or her an employee of the
school, regardless of whether he or she performs such work regularly or only on
occasion. Also, the fact that students on occasion do some cleaning up of a
classroom, serve the school as junior patrol officers or perform minor clerical
work in the school office or library for periods of an hour per day or less
without contemplation of compensation or in exchange or a meal or for a cash
amount reasonably equivalent to the price of a meal or, when a cash amount is
given in addition to a meal, it is only a nominal sum, is not considered
sufficient in itself to characterize the students as employees of the school. A
similar policy will be followed where the students perform such tasks less
frequently but for a full day, with an arrangement to perform their academic
work for such days at other times. For example, the students may perform
full-day cafeteria service four times per year. In such cases, the time devoted
to cafeteria work in the aggregate would be less than if the student worked an
hour per day. However, if there are other indicia of employment or the students
normally devote more than an hour each day or equivalent to such work, the
circumstances of the arrangement should be reviewed carefully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)           
In the ordinary case, tasks performed as a normal part of a
program of treatment, rehabilitation, or vocational training in the following
situations will not be considered, under Sec 3(g) of the Act, as “work” of a
kind requiring a hospital patient, school student, or institutional inmate to
be considered an employee of the hospital, school, or institution conducting
the program, for purposes of the FLSA: tasks performed by individuals committed
to training schools of a correctional nature, which are required as a part of
the correctional program of the institution as a part of the institutional
discipline and by reason of their value in providing needed therapy,
rehabilitation, or training to help prepare the inmate to become
self-sustaining in a lawful occupation after release</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)          
WH will not assert that initial participation by a student with
disabilities in a school-work program constitutes an employment relationship if
certain conditions are met. However, after an employment relationship has
developed, the provisions of the Act will be applicable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(i)            
The conditions under which an employment relationship initially
will not be asserted are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
The activities are basically educational, are conducted primarily
for the benefit of the participants, and comprise one of the facets of the
educational opportunities provided to the students. The student may receive
some payment for their work in order to have a more realistic work situation,
or as an incentive to the student or to insure that the employer will treat the
student as a worker.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
The time in attendance at the school plus the time in attendance
at the experience station (either in the school or with an outside employer)
does not substantially exceed the time the student would be required to attend
school if following a normal academic schedule. Time in excess of 1 hour beyond
the normal school schedule or attendance at the experience station on days when
school is not in session would be considered substantial.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(j)            
The student does not displace a regular employee or impair the
employment opportunities of others by performing work which would otherwise be
performed by regular employees who would be employed by the school or an
independent contractor including, for example, employees of a contractor
operating the food service facilities at the school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(k)          
The shift to an employment relationship may occur shortly after
the placement or it may occur later. As a general guide, work for a particular
employer, either a private employer or the school, after 3 months will be
assumed by WH to be part of an employment relationship unless the facts
indicate that the training situation has not materially changed. Thus, if the
conditions which warranted the finding that the student is not considered an
employee continue, he or she may remain for a period of time as a trainee
rather than an employee. On the other hand, if after the 3-month period the
training aspects are subordinated and the work aspects clearly predominate, the
student will be considered as an employee.</p>

<h3>10b04 - Employer asserts homework
performed by independent contractor.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
For investigation purposes, it can be assumed that a homeworker
is an employee, even though there may be a buying and selling arrangement
between the parties.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
If the employer asserts their outside work or homework is
performed by independent contractors, the following factors should be
considered concerning the employee-employer relationship:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
Does the employer have the right to control the manner of the
performance of the work or the time in which the work is to be done?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
Is the employer paying taxes for social security, unemployment,
or workmen’s compensation insurance?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
Has the homeworker ever collected any benefits, such as
unemployment or workmen’s compensation, because of employment by the employer?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
Does the employer furnish the material, or finance directly or
indirectly the purchase of the material which the homeworker uses?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)          
When did the practice of buying and selling between the employer
and the homeworker begin, and what are the mechanics of the transaction?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)          
Does the homeworker bill the employer for the work done? Are
bills of sale prepared? Are sales taxes paid, or are State or local exemptions
obtained because of retail purposes? Are payments made in cash or by check?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)          
How does the homeworker’s profit under the buying-selling
arrangement compare with their wages as a homeworker?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)          
Whom does the homeworker consider to be the employer?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9)          
Does the homeworker have a State certificate to do homework?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(10)       
What equipment is used, what is its value, and who furnishes it?</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b05 - Test of the employment
relationship.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
The principal test relied upon by the courts for determining
whether an employment relationship exists has been whether the possible
employer controls or has the right to control the work to be done by the
possible employee to the extent of prescribing how the work shall be performed.
Additional considerations are the method of payment and how free the possible
employer is to replace the possible employee with another. However, the Supreme
Court has said that there is “no definition that solves all problems as to the
limitations of the employer-employee relationship” under the FLSA. A determination
of the relationship cannot be based on “isolated factors” or upon a single
characteristic “but rather upon the circumstances of the whole activity”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
The factors which the Supreme Court has considered significant,
although no single one is regarded as controlling, are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
the extent to which the services in question are an integral part
of the employer’s business;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
the amount of the alleged contractor’s investment in facilities
and equipment;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
the alleged contractor’s opportunities for profit and loss; and,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
the amount of initiative, judgment, or foresight in open market
competition with others required for the success of the claimed independent
enterprise.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b06 - Amount of control.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Where the facts clearly establish that the possible employee is
the subordinate party, the relationship is one of employment. To determine the
amount of control consider:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
whether there are restrictive provisions in the contract between
the possible employer and possible employee which require that the work must be
satisfactory to the possible employer and detailing, or giving the possible
employer the right to detail, how the work is to be performed;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
whether the possible employer has control over the business of
the person performing work for them, even though the possible employer does not
control the particular circumstances of the work;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
whether the contract is for an indefinite period or for a
relatively long period;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
whether the possible employer may discharge employees of the
alleged independent contractor;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)          
whether the possible employer may cancel the contract at their
discretion, and on how much notice;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)          
whether the work done by the alleged independent contractor is
the same or similar to that done by admitted employees.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b07 - Other considerations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Since the determination of whether an employment relationship
exists depends “upon the circumstances of the whole activity”, particular
factors to be considered are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
Is the alleged independent contractor listed on the payroll with
the appropriate tax deductions, or are the payments to them charged to the
labor and salary account or selling expense account instead of to the account
to which attorney’s fees, auditor’s fees, and the like, are charged?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
Must employees of the alleged independent contractor be approved
by the possible employer?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
Does the possible employer keep the books and prepare the payroll
for the possible employee?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
Is the alleged independent contractor assigned to a particular
territory without freedom of movement outside thereof?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)          
Does the alleged independent contractor have an independent
economic or other interest in their work, other than increasing their own pay?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)          
How do the respective tax returns of the parties list the
remuneration paid?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
If the possible employer has control over the manner in which the
work is to be performed, the absence of any or all of the foregoing factors
will not indicate an absence of the employer-employee relationship. However,
where the element of control cannot be firmly established, they will help in
determining whether the relationship is one of employer and employee or of
independent contractors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
The following factors are immaterial to the determination of
whether the relationship is one of employer-employee or of independent contractors:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
the State or local government grants a license to the alleged
independent contractor;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
the measurement, method, or designation of compensation;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
the fact that no compensation is paid and the alleged independent
contractor must rely entirely on tips;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
the place where the work is performed;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)          
the absence of a formal employment agreement. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b08 - Effect of “sale” on the employment
relationship.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
An employment relationship may exist between the parties to a
transaction which is nominally a “sale” Thus, house-to-house canvassers who
sell at retail the products of a particular company are employees of the
company, although their contracts with the company are in the form of “dealer”
contracts under which the company purports to “sell” its products to them at
fixed wholesale prices and to “recommend” retail prices at which the products
should be sold, where the control exercised by the company over the so-called
“dealers” is not substantially different than that exercised by an employer
over their outside salesmen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
Likewise, an employee is not converted into an independent
contractor by virtue of a fictitious “sale” of the goods produced by him or her
to an employer, so long as the other indications of the employment relationship
exist. Homeworkers who “sell” their products to a manufacturer are his or her
employees where the control exercised by the manufacturer over the homeworkers
through their ability to reject or refuse to “buy” the product is not
essentially different from the control ordinarily exercised by a manufacturer
over employees performing work for him or her at home on a piece rate basis.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b09 - Subject-matter of the employment relationship.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
The subject-matter of the employment relationship must be work or
its equivalent. The Supreme Court has set forth the essential elements of work
as:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
physical or mental exertion (whether burdensome or not);</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
controlled or required by the employer; and,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer
and his or her business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
An essential element of work is not only that the employer
receives certain benefits from the services of the alleged employees but that
“the work necessarily or primarily benefits the company”.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b10 - Effect of determination of the employment
relationship.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Once it is determined that one who is reputedly an independent
contractor, lessee, partner, or the like, is in fact an employee, then all the
employees of this so-called independent contractor engaged in the work for the
principal employer likewise become the employees of the principal employer, who
must guarantee compliance with the FLSA. Thus, the one who is responsible will
be charged with seeing to compliance with the FLSA and must keep the records of
the employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
However, a manufacturer or producer may undertake to see to it
that a true independent contractor complies with the FLSA, in order to avoid
interference with the manufacturer’s own operations through “hot goods” action
under FLSA Sec. 15(a)(1). Such an arrangement does not make the manufacturer or
producer the employer.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b11 - Trainees and student-trainees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
The Supreme Court has held that the words “to suffer or permit to
work,” as used in the FLSA to define “employ”, do not make all persons
employees who, without any express or implied compensation agreement, may work
for their own advantages on the premises of another.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
Whether trainees or students are employees of an employer under
the FLSA will depend upon all of the circumstances surrounding their activities
on the premises of the employer. If all six of the following criteria apply,
the trainees or students are not employees within the meaning of the FLSA:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
the training, even though it includes actual operation of the
facilities of the employer, is similar to that which would be given in a
vocational school;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
the training is for the benefit of the trainees or students;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
the trainees or students do not displace regular employees, but
work under their close observation;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
the employer that provides the training derives no immediate
advantages from the activities of the trainees or students, and on occasion
operations may actually be impeded;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)          
the trainees or students are not necessarily entitled to a job at
the conclusion of the training period; and,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)          
the employer and the trainees or students understand that the
trainees or students are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b12 - Government sponsored employment development
programs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Certain Federal and State training programs are designed to equip
the labor force in an area with needed and marketable skills and may be
specifically directed toward providing local industries with a labor pool from
which workers having particular skills may be drawn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
Inv’s may encounter programs of this type conducted under the
auspices of Federal and State agencies in which the facilities of business
establishments are utilized during training hours under an agreement or lease
arrangement with the agency. The instructors for such programs may, outside of
training hours, be employed by the establishment whose facilities are used.
Certain of the workers being trained may also be employed by this establishment
outside of training hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
Where the employees of the establishment are involved as either
instructors or trainees, particular care shall be taken to determine whether
there exists in actual fact an employment relationship, between the employer
being investigated and the employees involved, during the hours devoted
exclusively to the training program. The fact that the employer’s facilities
are utilized in the training program is not determinative of the existence of
an employment relationship between the employer and trainees or instructors
involved insofar as the hours devoted exclusively to such training is
concerned. Nor is the fact that the training program is directly related to the
employees’ regular jobs in itself controlling where, as may be the case, the
program is an independent training course conducted by the agency from which
both employees and the employer benefit. (See FOH 10b11 and IB Part 785.27
through 785.32.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)           
These instructions do not reflect a change in policy regarding
the applicability of FLSA to trainees who are employees, during the training
periods, of establishments investigated. They are designed, instead, to call
attention to the need for a careful examination of the facts in each situation
where training programs of the general type described are encountered. The
existence of an employment relationship during training periods is of
particular significance since an employee may be subject to FLSA by virtue of
employment in a covered enterprise even though not engaged in or producing
goods for interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b13 - Employer identification numbers issued by
Internal Revenue Service.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The issuance
of employer identification numbers by the Internal Revenue Service does not
constitute a determination as to employee-employer relationship under the FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b14 - Students training in skilled paramedical
occupations - nurses, x-ray technicians, etc.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Whether a student training for certain paramedical occupations is
viewed as an employee of a hospital within the meaning of the Act will depend
upon all the circumstances of the student’s activities on the premises of the
establishment. Where a bona fide student training program exists for such
paramedical occupations, and such program meets the criteria in Sec 10b11, no
employment relationship will be deemed to exist. Generally this involves
students training for such occupations as registered nurse, licensed vocational
or practical nurse, x-ray technician, certified laboratory assistant, or any
other skilled paramedical position. Such programs involve on-the-job training
combined with extensive classroom lectures and laboratory instruction generally
resulting in students receiving degrees, licensing, registration, or
certification by an appropriate board or society. The mere payment of a
scholarship, stipend, or allowance (as long as it does not exceed a reasonable
approximation of the expenses incurred by the trainee taking the course or
where it serves as an allowance for subsistence) will not be considered to
establish an employment relationship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
Situations may be encountered where such a student will work in
the hospital for compensation outside of the training schedule. In the typical
case a student may do office or switchboard work. In such cases the student
will be considered an employee during the time spent on such work and must be
paid in compliance with the Act’s requirements for such time. However, the fact
that the student would be considered an employee during such time would not
require the time spent in activities described in (a) above to be counted as
hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
On the other hand, the principles in (a) above do not include
certain training programs such as those conducted for nurses aides and
orderlies where much of the training consists of on-the-job training and work
experience with little if any related classroom lectures or laboratory
instructions and which ordinarily do not lead to licensing, registration or
certification. In many cases these programs exist only for the purpose of
filling existing vacancies on the hospital staff. In such cases the students
would be considered employees of the hospital. In this regard any time spent in
the classroom or attending lectures would not be considered hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b15 - Golf course caddies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Golf course
caddies are engaged to serve the needs of particular players for substantial
periods of time and their services are generally directed by and are of most
immediate benefit to the players themselves. Arrangements may vary but the
players, in one way or another, are expected to pay for the services rendered
to them by the caddy. Because of these circumstances, WH is not prepared to
assert that caddies are employees of the golf course operator.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b16 - Special duty nurses or “sitters” in hospitals
and nursing homes.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
In some cases a special duty nurse or “sitter” may be employed to
care for a patient in a hospital or nursing home. Whether the employee is employed
by the patient or by the hospital or nursing home is a question of fact. For
example, if the hospital or nursing home determines whether use of a special
duty nurse or “sitter” will be permitted, what the pay is to be (even though
paid directly by the patient), and decides which special duty nurse or “sitter”
will be assigned to a particular patient, the hospital or nursing home is
considered to be the employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
On the other hand, if the patient or their representative
contracts directly with the special duty nurse or “sitter” as to pay, hours of
work and other working conditions, and the establishment does not control or
supervise such work, an employment relationship does not exist between the
special duty nurse or “sitter” and the establishment. This same principle will
apply to a nurse or other employee on the hospital or nursing home staff who is
employed during her off-duty hours as a special duty nurse or “sitter” by a
patient in the establishment. During the period or periods in which the employee
is so engaged on this special duty by the patient, WH will consider the
employment relationship as with the patient and not with the hospital or
nursing home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
A special duty nurse or “sitter” who is employed by the patient
to care for such patient in a hospital or nursing home, as described in (b)
above, is not employed “in connection with the operation of” the hospital or
nursing home (see Sec 3(r)). The employment is in the nursing home or hospital
only because the patient is there and the work is not connected “with the
operation of” the hospital or nursing home as such.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b17 - Newspaper “area correspondents” or
“stringers”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Some
newspapers have arrangements to obtain news stories (particularly local
interest stories from outlying areas served by the newspaper) from persons
identified in the industry as “area correspondents” or “stringers”. These
writers ordinarily select their own materials which they obtain in the course
of other occupations or while attending local events such as parties, athletic
contests, and the like. They are paid on a per word or per line basis for
stories submitted and accepted by the newspaper. The arrangements vary but
traditionally the newspapers have considered these people to be in the same
general category as professional free-lance writers and not employees. WH will
not assert that an employee-employer relationship exists in such cases.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b18 - Graduate students - research assistants.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In some
cases graduate students in colleges and universities are engaged in research in
the course of obtaining advanced degrees and the research is performed under
the supervision of a member of the faculty in a research environment provided
by the institution under a grant or contract. Normally, the graduate students
involved in these programs are simultaneously performing research under the
grants or contracts and fulfilling the requirements of an advanced degree.
Under such circumstances, WH will not assert an employee-employer relationship
between the students and the school, or between the student and the grantor or
contracting agency, even though the student receives a stipend for their
services under the grant or contract.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b19 - Externs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In some
cases medical students elect in their senior year of medical school to work as
“externs” in a hospital for a short period, sometimes six weeks. An extern is
assigned to one of the hospital’s major areas of post-graduate training, such
as medicine, general surgery or obstetrics. They attend the needs of patients
under the immediate supervision of licensed physicians and also attend
conferences, teaching rounds, and classroom exercises. The program is designed
to provide the student with professional experience in the furtherance of their
medical education in the same general manner as that provided interns. Such a
program constitutes a part of the educational opportunities provided to the
externs. Since such training is so predominantly for the benefit of the extern,
WH will not assert that such externs are employees of the hospital to which
they are assigned.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b20 - Administrative residents in hospitals.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Some college graduate school programs provide that candidates for
the degree of Master of Hospital Administration (sometimes identified as Master
of Business Administration, Master of Arts, Master of Public Health, etc.) must
serve a certain period (often 12 months) of administrative residency in a
hospital. The candidates continue as students on the rolls of the college. In
the usual case, the hospital administrator responsible for the resident is also
on the college faculty. The resident performs various tasks in the hospital,
and generally prepares a thesis or various reports to the college concerning
hospital administration. The resident may receive a stipend or allowance from
the hospital. Pending interpretation by the courts, WH for purposes of
enforcement of the Act will not assert that such students are employees of the
hospital to which they are assigned as residents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
In some instances, the resident to augment income may secure
employment in the hospital entirely apart from any duties performed as a
resident. The principles stated in FOH 10b14(b) apply to such employment.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b21 - Student “observers” in hotels and motels.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Certain colleges providing academic training in hotel
administration require their students to obtain a stipulated number of practice
credits in order to qualify for a degree. These student act as “observers” in
hotels and motels, usually during the summer months. Typically, the students
have some assigned duties and move from department to department to learn the
business.  Generally, the students are paid a nominal sum, such as $100 per month
plus room and meals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
Where such a program is designed to provide a student with
professional practice in the furtherance of his or her college education and
the training is academically oriented for the benefit of the student, WH will
not assert that the students are employees of the hotel or motel to which they
are assigned.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b22  - Job Corps enrollees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
The Job Corps is a residential program for youths between 16 and
21 years of age established under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as
amended. Enrollees live in a Job Corps center (or camp) which is operated by
either a governmental organization or a private organization, in either case
supervised by a Federal Agency. Under Sec 107(a) of this Act, the Director of
the Job Corps is authorized to “provide or arrange for the provision of
programs of useful work experience and other appropriate activities for
enrollees”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
In implementing this provision, the Job Corps has made
arrangements for the enrollees to work in private firms where they may perform
work covered by the FLSA. Such arrangements with private employers are usually
for part-time work and the average duration is four months. In such work
experience programs, supervision over the enrollees is maintained in order to
monitor their progress and maximize the quality of training given them.
Arrangements are made between the Job Corps and the private employer-trainer
regarding the division of training costs and the payment of wages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
If a Job Corps enrollee performs work subject to the FLSA in a private
firm in such a work experience program he would be considered for purposes of
the FLSA to be jointly employed by the corporation operating the center or camp
and the private employer. Wages paid to enrollees by either of the joint
employers will be considered in determining compliance with the Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)           
It is the position of Wage-Hour that where such an enrollee is
assigned to receive training and work experience with a private employer in an
off-the-center work site, the following activities will not create an
employee-employer relationship:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
In the preliminary stages of work experience, when the enrollee
has had little or no previous training in the occupation and does no useful
work, but is merely being acquainted with the employer’s business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
Time spent by the enrollee in a classroom situation in which no
useful work is performed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)           
The following activities will generally create an
employee-employer relationship assuming productive work is performed:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
When an enrollee has been sent to the employer for a short period
in order to determine his or her aptitude and interest in an occupation
preliminary to giving training.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
When the enrollee has been sent to the employer for a short
period in order to determine whether the training received is adequate to enable
him or her to get and keep a job in the occupation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)           
Job Corps enrollees also engage in on-site work experience, in
connection with the conservation and development of natural resources and
public recreational areas usually in conservation centers, and in performing
other tasks at the center itself. No such work performed by enrollees inures to
the benefit of the contractor who provides the training program and WH will not
assert that these activities are considered as work for an employer within the
coverage of the Act. Similarly, classroom activities whether or not resulting
in a useful product would be part of or incidental to the vocational training
program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)           
In determining the wages paid employees described in (c) above
the joint employers may include the reasonable cost of such items as food,
lodging, clothing, laundry, transportation to and from work, and medical and
dental care in accordance with Reg 531. The reasonable cost of providing an
employee with medical and dental care may be based on the average of the costs
actually incurred for all employees over a representative period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)          
In a Job Corps center (or camp) operated by a private employer,
the above principles in no way affect the application of the FLSA or SCA or PCA
to the employer’s own employees or employees of any subcontractors involved.
(See also FOH 13b10 and 14c01.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b23 - School employees - after hours work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
In some cases school employees will work outside of their normal
working hours where a third party (either public or private) uses the school
facilities. For example, a community organization may use the school cafeteria
for a banquet or the auditorium for a concert, and the food service or
custodial employees of the school will perform the necessary services. Time
spent in the operation of a school and the maintenance of school property, both
during and after regular school hours is normally considered hours worked under
the Act. School employees engaged in the operation and maintenance of school
facilities during periods in which their services are made available to a third
party are considered to be jointly employed by the school and the third party
if the school itself contracts for the use of such employees. The total time
spent in work for the joint employers will be counted as hours worked and paid
for in compliance with the MW and OT pay provisions of the Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
If the school does not require that its employees be utilized by
nonschool organizations when using school facilities but such employees are
hired merely for the convenience of the outside group and are paid directly by
them, the hours worked and compensation paid to such employees for this time
need not be included in determining compensation due to the employee for their
employment by the school.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b24 - University or college students.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
University or college students who participate in activities
generally recognized as extracurricular are generally not considered to be
employees within the meaning of the Act. In addition to the examples listed in
FOH 10b03(e), students serving as residence hall assistants or dormitory
counselors, who are participants in a bona fide educational program, and who
receive remuneration in the form of reduced room or board charges, free use of
telephones, tuition credits, and the like, are not employees under the Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
On the other hand, an employment relationship will generally
exist with regard to students whose duties are not part of an overall educational
program and who receive some compensation. Thus, for example, students who work
at food service counters or sell programs or usher at athletic events, or who
wait on tables or wash dishes in dormitories in anticipation of some
compensation (money, meals etc.) are generally considered employees under the
Act.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b25  - Fraternal orders - officers and volunteers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>WH will not
assert that an employment relationship exists under the Act for persons who
volunteer their services, including those who are elected, to a fraternal order
not as employees and without contemplation of pay. Included would be such
persons as the secretary and director or trustees of individual lodges. The
payment of a nominal sum would not affect the status of a bona fide volunteer.
(See also FOH 12a03.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b26 - School related work programs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Pursuant to the provisions of Sec 14(d) of the FLSA, WH will take
no enforcement action with respect to MW or OT for public or  private
elementary or secondary students employed by any school in their school
district in various school-related work programs, provided, that such
employment is in compliance with applicable CL provisions. This position is
adopted without prejudice to the rights of individual employees under Sec
16(b). This non-enforcement policy is not applicable to workers with
disabilities in sheltered workshops operated by elementary or secondary schools
since sheltered employment is not considered to be an integral part of a
regular education program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
If such employment is not in compliance with applicable CL
provisions, the students so employed must be paid MW and OT for all hours
worked in any w/w in which they were so employed. Also, the employer will be
subject to CL/CMP’s.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b27 - Prison inmates.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Generally, a prison inmate who, while serving a sentence, is
required to work by or who does work for the prison, within the confines of the
institution, on prison farms, roadgangs, or other areas directly associated
with the incarceration program, is not an employee within the meaning of the
Act (See also FOH 10b03(g)).</p>
<p>(b)           
A different situation exists, however, where inmates are
contracted out by an institution to a private company or individual. In such
instances an employee-employer relationship is created between the private company
or individual and the prisoners. This is true regardless of whether the work is
performed within the confines of the institution or elsewhere.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b28  - Jurors.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Service on
jury duty for either a petit or grand jury does not result in the establishment
of an employment relationship. Thus, all jurors and prospective jurors called
to serve by the requesting public agency are not employees under the Act.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b29 - Foster Parents.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Some
governmental agencies operate social service programs which arrange for and
finance the rearing of children by foster parents. No employment relationship
will be deemed to exist where:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
State or licensed private agency selects an individual who
voluntarily agrees to become a foster parent in accordance with State
standards, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
the foster parent services are provided in the foster parent’s
home, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
the State either directly or indirectly finances the foster
parent services.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b30 - Volunteers under the Domestic Volunteer
Services Act of 1973.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)        “Foster
Grandparent” and “Senior Companion” programs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Volunteers
participating in either the “Foster Grandparent” or “Senior Companion” programs
under the Domestic Volunteer Services Act of 1973, are not employees under the
FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
“University Year for Action” (UYA) programs.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>(1)          
Situations may be encountered where a university has established
a federally-funded “University Year for ACTION” (UYA) service learning program
pursuant to the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (DVSA). These programs
provide that students will receive college credits when they volunteer to
perform various services, often for a nonprofit private organization, on a
full-time basis for a year. The students receive a subsistence-level stipend to
cover their expenses, and they are required to live at the low income level of
the people they serve. The legislative history of the DVSA and the FLSA make
clear that these students are not considered employees for purposes of the
FLSA.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>(2)          
Universities which receive federal “University Year ACTION” funds
have a five-year funding limit, but are required to make every effort to
continue the program after federal funds cease. Under such UYA continuation
programs, the students generally receive college credit, pay tuition, receive a
stipend, keep a journal of their experiences, make presentations of their work
and learning, and present periodic written reports of their progress in
achieving the program’s objectives. In addition, the sponsor, ordinarily a
faculty member, evaluates their internship performance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
Where a UYA continuation program meets this description, WH will
not assert that an employment relationship exists. However, where programs are
encountered which differ materially from the above described circumstances,
obtain all the facts of the case and refer the file to the NO/OEP, ATTN: FLSA
Team.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b31 - Government activities - volunteer services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
principles in FOH 10b03(c) may apply with respect to certain governmental
activities. For example, an office employee of the city may volunteer to
perform nonclerical services, such as coaching a softball or basketball team in
a city-sponsored program during his or her off-duty time as a charitable or
civil act. Similarly a person may participate in the civil defense program for
civil or personal motives. Where a person performs such volunteer services
without promise or expectation of compensation, at hours that suit his or her
own convenience whether by schedule or otherwise, and where no regular employee
is replaced in the performance of normal duties, no employer-employee
relationship exists with respect to such time. The activity may be performed on
the employer’s premises so long as it is not done during any time the employee
is required to be on the premises and the control exercised by the employer is
only minimal. A person, however, may not be both an employee and a volunteer
while performing essentially the same duties. Thus, for example, a person
employed in park activities cannot have his or her time divided into “working
hours” and “volunteer hours” while performing the same or related duties.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b32 - Government-financed child care services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Whether individuals who provide child care services in their own
homes under an agreement with a government social service agency are employees
of such agency would depend upon the total fact situation involved in the
arrangement. If the parent (or person standing in the place of a parent) is
free to select, and in fact does select, an individual from a list of persons
supplied by the agency as qualified to perform the child care services, with
the agency merely agreeing to reimburse the child care “operator” selected, an
employee-employer relationship would not exist between the government agency
and the operator. Further, if the agency utilizes bona fide volunteers as day
care operators over whom no control is exercised, and the monetary payment is
simply to reimburse the operator for expenses, no employment relationship would
exist. However, the activities of such day care homes may be covered under the
Act, and the operator responsible for compliance with respect to any employees
employed in connection with the operation of the child care center. (See also
FOH 12g00.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
Conversely, if in fact such freedom of choice does not exist, and
the parent is told to which home the child must be taken for this service, and
the agency is closely involved in directing and controlling the operator in
performing the duties in rendering the child care services, an
employee-employer relationship would exist between the agency and the operator.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b33 - Election judges and officials.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>WH will take
no position as to whether persons employed by a public agency, such as a Board
of Elections or similar office, to serve as election judges and officials on
election days are employees of the public agency and covered by the Act.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b34 - Patient workers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
The court has held that patient workers in hospitals or
institutions whose work is of any consequential economic benefit to the
facility are to be treated as employees. While the court has generally
considered all circumstances in determining whether an employment relationship
existed, the court specifically rejected as determinative the alleged
therapeutic value of the work or the patient’s level of performance. In
general, we would hold that there is consequential economic benefit to the
institution if the work in question would be performed by someone else if it
were not done by the patient. However, where a patient is undergoing evaluation
or training, we will not hold the patient to be an employee during the first
three months of engagement in a work activity or activities provided the
patient spends no more than one hour a day and no more than 5 hours a week in
such activities and provided further that competent instruction and supervision
is provided the patient during such period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
A patient in a hospital or institution may volunteer and need not
be considered an employee for such services which would not be compensated by
the institution if performed by a person other than a patient. Such volunteer
services may include wheeling another patient in a wheelchair to and from
certain activities, planting a vegetable garden if the fruits of such labor
belong to the patient, and other similar activities. However, the ordinary
maintenance, patient care, office work and other activities that are performed
in the operation of an institution would create an employment relationship.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b35 - Residential drug abuse and alcohol treatment
programs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>There
are certain types of situations in residential drug abuse and alcohol treatment
programs where an employment relationship would not be deemed to exist. For
example, a residential care program which seeks to establish a “family setting”
for treatment of persons with drug or alcohol problems would not create an
employment relationship under the Act between the residents and the institution
where:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
The work performed by the residents is that which is ordinarily
done on a daily basis in a private home and is solely for the mutual benefit of
the occupants of the home (institution);</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
Residents do not perform work activities which would ordinarily
be performed by full-time employees of the institution so that there is no
displacement of regular full-time employees through substitution of resident
workers;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
Residence in the institution and performance of activities by the
occupants is short-term (usual no more than a year) as opposed to generally
long term occupancy in such institutions as those concerned with the mentally
ill, the mentally retarded, the aged, or the terminally ill;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
The institution is relatively small, houses a limited number of
residents, and has no paid staff other than counselors.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b36 - Veterans making artificial poppies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>It has long
been the practice in VA hospitals to have disabled veterans make artificial
poppies that are dispensed on street corners by the Veterans of Foreign Wars
and the American Legion. Whether these veterans are performing this work as
“employees” would depend on the fact in each case. However, in view of VA’s
involvement, WH will not handle complaints or investigate in this area but will
refer such matters to the VA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b37 - Pharmaceutical externs and interns.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Colleges and universities which offer degree programs in pharmacy
may require clinical or work experience at a pharmacy site. These “externship”
courses combine classroom lectures and lab work with on-site work training
under the supervision of a qualified pharmacist. Participation by students in
such extern courses as part of their pharmacy curriculum is predominantly for
their benefit and in furtherance of their educational opportunities. In some
States completion of such courses may reduce the postgraduation and
prelicensing “internship” requirements, thus enabling the students to become
licensed in a shorter time. Therefore, WH will not assert that an employment
relationship exists because of such work training.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
The States generally have a requirement that graduates of a
pharmacy degree program must serve as an apprentice or intern for up to a year
prior to licensure. However, where such individuals are serving in a
postgraduation internship, an employment relationship would exist between the
graduate interns and the pharmacies at which they work prior to licensing.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b38 - Programs for youthful or first-time offenders
designed as an alternative to incarceration.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As
part of their sentences, youthful or first-time offenders may spend a number of
hours in public service activities in community action programs or nonprofit
organizations formed for a public purpose. WH will not assert that an
employment relationship exists between offenders and participating
organizations where the juvenile or first-time offenders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
Voluntarily enter into the program for their own benefit;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
Do not displace regular employees or impinge on the employment
opportunities of others;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
Are under the supervision or control of the courts; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
Perform the work without contemplation of pay.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b39 - “Drying out” period for alcoholics in
sheltered workshops (SWS’s).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An alcoholic
admitted to a SWS frequently requires a “drying out” period before he/she is
capable of performing work. The alcoholic’s presence in the SWS during this
period is primarily intended to keep him/her away form alcohol and not to
perform any significant productive work. Consequently, WH will not assert that
an employment relationship exists in the case of an individual who is
substantiated to be an alcoholic (see FOH 64f09) during the first four weeks
(28 consecutive calendar days) in the SWS unless it is clearly evident that the
individual has been engaged in activities which provide consequential service
or benefit to the SWS (see FOH 64f05).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10b40 - Welfare/workfare programs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
More and more States are adopting welfare/workfare programs, i.e.
programs that require persons to perform work in some capacity in exchange for
receiving welfare assistance. These programs need to be carefully examined to
determine if an employer - employee relationship subject to FLSA exists. If the
welfare recipient is an employee subject to FLSA, the following facts must be
determined:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
Does the State welfare/workfare statute grant the State authority
to require the welfare recipient to work for their assistance?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
What hours of work are required of welfare recipients and are
records kept of those work hours?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
Does the welfare assistance (cash/benefits) provide a wage of not
less than the applicable MW and proper payment of OT when worked?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
Are recipients employed in violation of the child labor
provisions?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
If FLSA violations exist, potential BW and CMP liability should
be determined, and copies of documentation supporting the facts obtained above,
forwarded to the AA/OPO for review prior to any discussion with State
authorities regarding FLSA compliance. After this review, the AA/OPO will
advise the RO on how to proceed.</p>

<h3>10c00  Scope of the term “employer”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Sec 3(d) of the amended Act defines “employer” to include “… any
person acting... in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee and
includes a public agency...” and Sec 3(a) defines “person” to mean “.. an
individual, partnership, association, corporation, business trust, legal
representative, or any organized group of persons”. Thus, by interpolation of
the definition of  “person” into the definition of “employer”, the scope of the
term “employer” becomes apparent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
Sec 3(x) of the amended Act defines “public agency” to mean the
Government of the United States; the government of a State or political
subdivision thereof; any agency of the United States (including the United
States Postal Service and Postal Rate Commission), a State, or a political
subdivision of a State; or any interstate governmental agency.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10c01 - A partnership as an employer.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A
partnership is a “person” for purposes of the FLSA, and may be a party to the
employment relationship as an employer. The employment relationship is not
considered to exist between a bona fide partnership and the partners of whom it
is composed. Such partners are self-employed, since they cannot be said to be
employed by an employer separate and distinct from themselves. Merely calling
individuals who are essentially employees by the term “partners” under a
so-called partnership agreement, which fails to invest them with the usual
attributes of partnership in an enterprise, does not make them such.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10c02 - Cooperatives as employers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The FLSA
contains nothing to indicate that cooperative organizations, as such, are to be
excluded form the category of employers subject to its terms. It is clear that
the employment relationship may exist at least between such an organization and
non-members whom it hires or suffers or permits to work. Nor can it be said
that membership in a cooperative in the ordinary case establishes a mutual
agency analogous to a partnership or otherwise identifies the member so closely
with the cooperative that they cannot become, respectively, employer and
employee. Among the circumstances which may be taken to indicate that a
cooperative is an entity separate and distinct from its worker-members, are a
corporate form of organization, the presence of the usual incidents of the
employment relationship (for example, control by the governing body or a
designated officer over the work performed, the member’s hours of labor,
selection for and discharge from the job and the like) and the exercise of
financial or managerial control or the furnishing of capital or management
services by outsiders, especially if such outsiders are wholesalers, manufacturers,
or others who purchase or dispose of the products of the cooperatives.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10c03 - Corporations as employers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A
corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its stockholders. In
the ordinary case, a corporation and a stockholder therein can become parties
to the employment relationship as employer and employee, and a worker who is,
in other respects, in the position of an employee of a corporation must be
treated as such for the purposes of the FLSA, even though the worker owns
shares of stock in his or her corporate employer. Ownership of stock does not
destroy the duality of the parties to the relationship, even where the worker
is an officer of the corporation or where none but stockholders do the
corporation’s work.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10c04 - Excluded employers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The term
“employer”, as used In Sec 3(d) of the FLSA, “does not include any labor
organization (other than when acting as an employer) or anyone acting in the
capacity of officer or agent of such labor organization.” The qualifying
phrase, “other than when acting as an employer”, indicates observance of the
FLSA with respect to any individuals directly employed by it, whether or not
such individuals are members of the organization, and even though they are
elected to their positions by the entire membership.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10c05 - Political subdivisions of a State.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
determination of whether a particular body is a “political subdivision” of a
State within the meaning of FLSA Sec 3(d) must be controlled by the intention
of Congress. In general, the term “political subdivision” is interpreted for
purposes of the FLSA to include counties, townships, cities, towns, villages,
school districts, drainage districts, etc.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10c06 - Status of contractors with a government.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The fact
that an employer is doing work for the Federal Government or a State Government
does not transform the employer into a government instrumentality, nor place
him/her in the position of the “United States or any State or political
subdivision of a State.” Not even the fact that the Federal or a State
Government has contracted for the performance by a private employer of a
function purely governmental in character is sufficient to make the government
the employer of the individuals employed by the contractor to perform the
function.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10c07 - Federal Reserve Bank employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Federal
Reserve Bank employees are not employees of the U.S. within the meaning of FLSA
Sec 3(d).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10c08 - Farm Credit Administration Banks and
Associations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of
the following Farm Credit Administration Banks and Associations are considered
as “employees” within the meaning of FLSA and subject to its provisions in the
same manner as employees of the ordinary commercial bank or credit
establishment:  Federal Land Banks, Federal Land Bank Associations, Federal
Intermediate Credit Banks, Production Credit Associations and Banks for
Cooperatives.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10c09 - Status of State-sponsored workshops.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A
State-sponsored workshop or other institution for aid to the handicapped may or
may not be considered the same as the State, depending on the facts concerning
the establishment and operation of the particular institution. Employment in a
State workshop for the blind is considered to be employment by the State itself
where:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
The institution was founded by an act of the legislature for the
purpose of providing a central and responsible State unit to administer relief
to the blind;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
the financial operations of the institution were audited by a
fiscal officer of the State; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
its identity with the State was further established by statutory
provisions vesting supervision and control in a board of trustees, of whom a
majority were appointed by the Governor, and providing for the financing of the
institution out of public funds.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10c10 - Status of foreign governments.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Although the
FLSA does not expressly exclude foreign governments from the category of
employers subject to its provisions, the usual principles of international
comity are applied to exclude the direct agencies of such governments from
compliance with the Act. This rule, however, applies only if the agency is
exercising part of the sovereign power of the foreign government. If the agency
is a commercial one engaged in commercial operations in competition with
American industries, the agency is not excluded under this principle and the
employees are entitled to the benefits of the FLSA. The United Nations is in
the same category as a foreign government.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10c11 - States and political subdivisions - single
employers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
The government of a State, that is, all the departments and
agencies of any of the 50 States, constitutes a single employer under the Act.
Similarly, the government of a political subdivision, e.g., county, city, etc.,
with all of its departments and agencies, constitutes a single employer under
the Act. However, such entities are separate and distinct from the government
of the State and from other political subdivisions. Thus, for example, where an
employee works for more than one agency of the State government, or for more
than one agency of a political subdivision, such employee’s employment is by a
single employer. Each agency is both individually and coequally responsible for
compliance with all applicable provisions of the Act with respect to such employee.
However, see FOH 59d.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
Political subdivisions (see FOH 10c05) and interstate agencies
have traditionally been recognized as entities separate and distinct from the
government of the State.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10c12 - Community action agency.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Public agencies.</p>
<p>(1)          
Whether a community action agency, which administers various
antipoverty and economic opportunity programs, is a covered employer under the
FLSA depends upon the facts in a particular situation. Any community action
agency which is an entity of a State, a political subdivision of a State, or a
combination of public agencies is clearly an employer covered under the Act.
(See Secs 3(d) and 3(x) and FOH 10c05.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
However, a community action agency which consists solely of a
private nonprofit agency or organization that has been designated by the State
(or political subdivision thereof) would not thereby become a “public agency”.
This does not, of course, preclude coverage of such private community action
agency under another provision of the FLSA. A private community action agency
does not become a “public agency” merely because it receives and disburses
Federal funds. However, see FOH 59d.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
Enterprise coverage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Enterprise
coverage does not apply to the charitable, educational, religious or similar
activities of private nonprofit organizations except where such activities are
performed in connection with the type of institution set out in Sec 3(s)(1) of
the Act or in connection with commercial ventures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
“Individual” coverage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Individual
coverage may apply to employees of such organizations.</p>

<h3>10d00 - Scope of the term “employee”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Sec 3(e)(1) of the amended Act defines the term “employee” to
include any individual employed by an employer, except as provided in Secs
3(e)(2), (3) and (4).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
Sec 3(e)(2) of the amended Act provides that in the case of an
individual employed by a public agency, the term “employee” means:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
any individual employed by the Government of the United States –</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
as a civilian in the military departments (as defined in section
102 of title 5, United States Code),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.             
in any executive agency (as defined in section 105 of such
title),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.             
in any unit of the legislative or judicial branch of the
Government which has positions in the competitive service,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.             
in a nonappropriated fund instrumentality under the jurisdiction
of the Armed Forces, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.             
in the Library of Congress</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
any individual employed by the United States Postal Service or
the Postal Rate Commission; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
any individual employed by a State, political subdivision of a
State, or an interstate governmental agency, other than such an individual –</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
who is not subject to the civil service laws of the State,
political subdivision, or agency which employs him; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.             
who</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.             
holds a public elective office of that State, political
subdivision, or agency,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.             
is selected by the holder of such an office to be a member of his
personal staff,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.             
is appointed by such an office holder to serve on a policy-making
level, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.             
who is an immediate adviser to such an office holder with respect
to the constitutional or legal powers of his or her office, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5.             
is an employee in the legislative branch or legislative body of
such State, political subdivision, or agency and is not employed by the
legislative library of such State, political subdivision, or agency</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.             
The first category (b. 1, above) is limited to those persons who
are elected by the voters of the pertinent jurisdiction.  With respect to the
second and third categories (b.2 and b.3, above) the following are examples of
tests which are to be considered:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.             
Is the person’s employment entirely at the discretion of the
elected office holder?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.             
Is the position not subject to approval or clearance by the
personnel department or division of any part of the government?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.             
Is the work performed outside of any position or occupation
established by a table of organization as part of a legislative, executive, or
judicial branch, or a committee or commission established by such a branch?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.             
Is the person’s compensation dependent upon a specific
appropriation or is it paid out of an office expense allowance provided to the
office holder? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The fourth
category (b.4, above) is limited to that of a legal advisor, i.e., a lawyer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.             
Thus individuals such as pages, stenographers, telephone
operators, clerks, typists and others employed by the branch or commission as a
whole, may be considered “employees” under the Act. An additional example would
be deputy sheriffs who, although they are selected by and work under the
direction of the sheriff, are employed only after approval of their employment
by the Board of Commissioners. They are not employed at the sole discretion of
the sheriff pursuant to the second (II, above) category.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
Of course, employees who are not excluded by the provisions of
Sec 3(e)(2)(C) may qualify for exemption under Reg 541 if the tests are met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)           
Pursuant to section 3(e)(4) of the FLSA, the term “employee” does
not include any individual who volunteers to perform services for a public
agency which is a State, a political subdivision of a State, or an interstate
government agency, if-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
the individual receives no compensation or is paid expenses,
reasonable benefits, or a nominal fee to perform the services for which the
individual volunteered; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
such services are not the same type of services which the
individual is employed to perform for such public agency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)           
An employee of a public agency which is a State, political
subdivision of a State, or an interstate governmental agency may volunteer to
perform services for any other State, political subdivision, or interstate
governmental agency, including a State, political subdivision or agency with
which the employing State, political subdivision, or agency has a mutual aid
agreement.</p>

<h3>10d01  - Employees of the Library of Congress.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Pursuant to Sec 4(f) of the amended Act, the Secretary is
authorized to enter into an agreement with the Librarian of Congress for
enforcement of the FLSA with respect to any individual employed in the Library
of Congress. An agreement is now in effect which provides that the Library of
Congress will investigate its own complaints.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10d02  - Employees of the United States.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 4(f) of the amended Act authorizes the Civil Service
Commission (now the Office of Personnel Management) to administer the
provisions of the FLSA with respect to any individual employed by the U.S.
(other than an individual employed in the Library of Congress, United States
Postal Service, Postal Rate Commission, or the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10d03 - Suits by Federal, State and local government
employees under Sec 16(b).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 16(b) of the FLSA and Sec 6 of the Portal Act provide
that employees of a public agency may sue for BW’s in any Federal or State
court of competent jurisdiction for themselves or other employees.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10d04 - Member of the elected official’s personal
staff.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Sec 3(e)(2)(C) excludes from the definition of employee under the
FLSA individuals who are selected by an elected office holder to be a member of
his or her personal staff. The “personal staff” does not include individuals
who are directly supervised by someone other than the elected official even
though they may be selected by and serve at the pleasure of such official.</p>
<p>(b)           
Generally personal staff includes only persons who are under the
direct supervision of the elected official and who have almost daily contact
with him or her. It would, for example, include the official’s private
secretary, but not the secretary to his or her assistant, or the stenographers
in a pool that services the official’s department, or staff members in an
operational unit whose head reports to the elected official. It would typically
not include all members of an operational unit, since all the members could not
have a personal working relationship with the elected official.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10d06 - National Guard technicians.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>National Guard technicians, whose positions are created by
Federal statute, are Federal civilian employees and the application of the FLSA
to them is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission
(now Office of Personnel Management) under Sec 4(f) of the Act. (See FOH
10d02.)</p>

<h3>10e01 - FLSA application to employees performing
duties both in the U.S. and foreign countries such as Canada, Mexico, or
Panama.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Coverage shall be asserted for U.S. and foreign citizens employed
at or working out of an establishment or work site, located in a State, as
defined in the Act, even though the employer is a foreign citizen, when such
employees are engaged in or producing goods for interstate commerce or are
employed in an enterprise described in Sec 3(s).</p>
<p>(b)           
Employees employed by and working in an establishment located in
a foreign country are not considered subject to the FLSA merely because they make
deliveries in the States, or pick up materials in the States for transport to a
foreign country.</p>
<p>(c)           
On the other hand, where an employee of such an establishment is
working in the U.S. for a substantial period of time and performs covered,
nonexempt work, coverage would be asserted. A worker who travels more than 25
miles from the U.S. border or spends more than 72 hours in the U.S. on a single
visit (whichever occurs first) is considered to have spent a substantial period
of time in the U.S. Once a worker has spent a substantial period in the U.S.,
all hours of work in the U.S. on that visit must be compensated at no less than
the minimum wage, including hours of work prior to the worker reaching the 25
mile or 72 hour mark</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>10e02  - Employees in foreign countries.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The FLSA does not apply to employees exclusively employed in
foreign countries even though they may be American citizens and employees of an
American employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11a00 - Interpretative
Bulletins and use of chapter.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   IB 776, Subparts A and B, together with releases
issued to the general public, contain the official WH position regarding
coverage under FLSA which is based on the individual employee’s engagement in
or production for interstate or foreign commerce or in a closely related
process or occupation directly related to such production. FOH Chapter 11
supplements these documents with respect to such individual coverage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The examples of specific occupations contained in this
chapter are designed to illustrate only the application of individual coverage
principles. The possibility of coverage based on the particular employee’s
employment in an enterprise described in Sec 3(s) must not be overlooked where
individual coverage does not exist.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11a01 - Summary statement of
individual coverage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Individual coverage depends on the nature of the
particular employee’s work. An employee is covered on an individual basis in
each workweek in which he or she performs any work constituting engagement in
interstate or foreign commerce, or the production of goods for interstate or
foreign commerce, including any closely related process or occupation directly
essential to such production. As a practical matter, WH does not assert
individual coverage over an employee who is ordinarily engaged in employment
which is not so covered but who may on isolated occasions spend an
insubstantial amount of time performing individually covered work. However,
this rule is not applicable in any workweek in which an employee spends a
substantial amount of time doing individually covered work. If, in viewing the
employment over a more extended period, it is apparent that the pattern of
individual coverage is regular and recurrent, the employee involved is so
covered in each workweek in which he does such work, regardless of whether the
amount of time spent in this work is substantial or insubstantial. In
situations where an employer, for compliance purposes, seeks to segregate
individual coverage from other employment, the employer must be prepared to
demonstrate the basis of this segregation from his or her records.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   It is not possible to establish precise guidelines to
be followed in determining whether an employee who is not otherwise covered on an
individual basis spends an insubstantial amount of time on isolated occasions
in the performance of individually covered work. In view of the remedial
purposes of the Act, the application of this rule is limited to circumstances
where the time consumed by an employee in doing such covered work is obviously
trivial, and the incidence of this covered work is so infrequent and
out-of-pattern that it would be unrealistic to assert individual coverage
solely on such grounds. This must be decided on the facts in a particular case.</p>

<h3>11a02 - Accounting.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Accounting service rendered for, or on behalf of
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or organizations which are engaged in
interstate commerce, is so closely related to that commerce as to be a part
thereof.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The preparation of reports for direct or indirect
interstate transmission is also individually covered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Accounting service rendered exclusively within the
State for an interstate producer is a closely related process or occupation
directly essential to the production of goods by the interstate producer.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11a03 - Advertising.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees engaged in
making local surveys in accordance with a questionnaire prepared by an
advertising, agency, which information is transmitted to other States in the
form of publications, pamphlets, or other written material, are actually
producing goods for interstate commerce. Even where the information or material
prepared merely serves as a basis for other printed matter which is shipped
directly or indirectly out of the State, the employees preparing the
information or material are engaged in a process or occupation closely related
and directly essential to the production of the goods for interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11a04 - Advertising display
materials.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where advertising
display materials are shipped across State lines, all employees who in any
manner work on such goods are engaged in interstate commerce. Individual
coverage thus extends to those employees who order, receive, handle, or unpack
the materials which come from outside the State, to employees who transport the
display materials across State lines, and to employees whose movements across
State lines are regular and recurring and are made in the performance of their
duties. In addition, display materials received from out of State sources and
earmarked for particular sites remain in interstate commerce until final
installation is effected; and, the employees installing such material (for
example, window trimmers and billboard pasters) are individually covered. This
is not temporary storage until the site of installation is ready for the
display to be installed, since the interstate movement of the display materials
is not terminated by such storage.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11a05 - Advertising,
manufacturers’ samples, and telephone directories: distribution of:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees of an agency engaged in the intrastate
distribution of out-of-State advertising, manufacturers’ samples, and telephone
directories by hand to local individuals and businesses may be subject to the
FLSA as engaged in interstate commerce. Where the items distributed are
received from out-of-State sources, they remain in the stream of interstate
commerce until they reach the destination intended for them by the importer.
Thus, they remain in interstate commerce while they are being distributed from
door to door. With respect to telephone books, for example, there is a
pre-existing contract or understanding with the subscribers for their delivery.
The door-to-door delivery is not any more of an interruption in the interstate
journey than the drop-shipment delivery to a customer of out-of-State goods by
any local transportation company. The distributing companies are merely agents
for their principals, their only function being to make deliveries of the
advertising matter, manufacturers’ samples, or telephone directories in
accordance with previous understandings or instructions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees engaged in the collection and shipment of
old telephone directories across State lines are engaged in interstate commerce
and in the production of goods for interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11a06 - Agricultural
limestone.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Individual coverage
shall not be asserted for employees engaged in the intrastate production and
distribution of agricultural limestone, which like fertilizer is used in
raising agricultural products for shipment in interstate commerce. (See IB
776.19(b)(4).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11a07 - Air conditioning
equipment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees engaged in the sale, installation, and
servicing of air conditioning systems in establishments engaged in the
production of goods for interstate commerce are engaged in activities which are
both closely related and directly essential to production of the goods, since
these activities are directed to the improvement of the facilities of
production. This is true whether the work in connection with air conditioning
is performed in the manufacturing portion of the factory or in the
administrative offices of the factory or building in which the goods are
produced.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Individual coverage shall not be asserted, however, on
the basis of the intrastate sale of window or room type cooling equipment
merely because it is sold to producers of goods for interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11a08 - Airline passengers
and goods - ground transportation.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees engaged in
transporting passengers and freight to and from an airport in connection with
interstate trips are engaged in interstate commerce, although all the
operations of the transit service may be wholly within the borders of the
State.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11a09 - Alarm systems.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The installation, servicing and repair of burglar or
fire alarm systems in establishments engaged in the production of goods for
commerce, and the receipt and relay of alarms from such establishments, are
activities closely related and directly essential to the production of goods
for interstate commerce. Individual coverage on these grounds also exists for
maintenance, custodial, clerical and all other employees of an alarm service
whose work is a part their employer’s integrated effort to meet the needs of
production establishments for protection of the establishment and finished or
unfinished goods.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees who install or service alarms in warehouse
buildings, freight and passenger terminals, radio and telegraph stations, and
telephone exchanges are performing work so closely related to the interstate
commerce flowing through such facilities as to be regarded as engaged in
interstate commerce.</p>

<h3>11a10 - Auction houses.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees of auction houses may be subject to the
FLSA, i.e., engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for
interstate commerce, or both. Auctioneers and catalogue and appraisal clerks
who are regularly engaged in traveling across State lines in the performance of
their duties are engaged in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Clerical employees, whose work involves the continued
use of the interstate mails or telephone or telegraph for communication across
State lines are likewise engaged in interstate commerce. On the other hand,
employees who merely receive goods delivered by local prospective
vender-customers of the auction house, and shipping employees who merely
prepare and release items purchased by a local high bidder are not engaged in
interstate commerce, assuming that none of the goods when received are still in
interstate commerce and that they are not to be shipped out of the State.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Auctioneers, callers, catalogue, deposit, and
appraisal clerks, who are engaged in preparation and sale of industrial
machinery and equipment for use by producers of goods for interstate commerce,
are engaged in closely related processes or occupations directly essential to
the production of the goods. In addition, all the employees of the auction
house, including maintenance, custodial, and clerical employees, whose work is
part of the employer’s integrated effort to supply the needs of producers of
goods for interstate commerce with such industrial machinery and equipment, are
subject to the FLSA for the same reason.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11a11 - Ambulance
services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Ambulance drivers and attendants who transport persons
on part of an interstate trip (as to or from an airport or railway terminal) or
who travel across State lines in performing ambulance services are engaged in
covered activities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Ambulance crews engaged in making intrastate trips to
pick up dead or injured victims of motor vehicle accidents from the scenes of
such accidents on city streets, county roads or State or federal highways are
also engaged in individually covered activities. It is well established that
vehicle accidents which interfere with the interstate movement of goods and
persons on the highways require prompt action to remove the stopped and
disabled vehicles which constitute a costly and dangerous impediment to the
free movement of such commerce. The vehicles blocking the traffic cannot in
most instances be permitted to be moved from their post-accident positions on
the roadway until such persons as may have been injured or killed in the
accident have been attended to. Ordinarily, this requires ambulance service
whenever a highway accident involves deaths or personal injuries of a serious
nature. To appreciate the serious effect on traffic of any delay in the arrival
of ambulances and removal of damaged vehicles by towtrucks in such cases, it is
only necessary to listen to the aerial police reports on traffic during the
rush hours in any sizable city. Detours, delay, and congestion of traffic on
any interstate route in which one or more lanes become blocked by such
accidents are the rule until the vehicles are removed, which police ordinarily
do not permit pending necessary attention to any victims of the accident. Such
ambulance service is not “isolated local activity”, but rather so closely
related to the movement of commerce and the functioning of its instrumentalities
as to be a part thereof. (See also FOH 24c08 and IB 779.369(e).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11a12 - Automobile
licenses.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Automobile license
bureaus or tag agencies may be operated as a separate business by private
employers under contract with the State, or in conjunction with some other
business, such as insurance or accounting. Employees of such establishments who
handle applications for automotive licenses and deliver such licenses to users,
collecting the authorized fees therefor, are individually covered by the Act.
The relationship of the employee’s work to interstate commerce stems from the
fact that registrations and registration plates are issued to provide
identification of the vehicle in controlling the flow of traffic and the
movement of persons and goods over the highways which carry interstate traffic,
and that the revenues from such sources are customarily used to build and
maintain these arteries of commerce.</p>

<h3>11b00 - Banks and
financial institutions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees of banks and financial institutions,
including mutual savings banks and savings and loan associations, may be
subject to the FLSA as either engaged in interstate commerce or in the
production of goods for interstate commerce, or both. Employees engaged in the
interstate transmittal, directly or indirectly, of money, drafts, travelers’
checks, and letters of credit, the making of loans to persons residing in other
States, and the taking as security for loans property located in other States
are actually engaged in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees who engage in the preparation, execution,
and liquidation of bonds, shares of stock, commercial paper, bills of lading,
and the like are producing goods, even though the activity may be no more than
registering one of a series of bonds. Where such instruments are transmitted
directly or indirectly out of the State, the employees so engaged are engaged
in the production of goods for interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Those whose clerical activities directly relate to the
preparation, execution, and validation of the instruments mentioned above, and
those who prepare letters, documents, pamphlets, papers, and other records
pertaining to the interstate activity of the institution are subject to the
FLSA because they are producing goods for interstate commerce. They may also be
individually covered because their activities are so closely related to the
interstate movement of the instruments as to be regarded as interstate
commerce. They also are engaged in processes or occupations closely related and
directly essential to the production of goods for interstate commerce by other
employees of the bank.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Watchmen, maintenance and custodial employees, and guards
may be subject to the FLSA for the same reasons as clerical employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   However, individual coverage shall not be asserted for
bank employees who operate an adjacent parking lot for the convenience of bank
customers. They cannot be said to be either engaged in activities closely
related to the movement of the interstate commerce, nor are they engaged in
processes or occupations closely related and directly essential to the
production of goods for interstate commerce by other employees of the bank.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Employees regulating and operating the space devoted
to a drive-in bank are engaged in work closely related and directly essential
to the bank’s production for interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11b01 - Blueprints and
plans.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees engaged in
the preparation of blueprints, sketches, plans, and the like, are covered on an
individual basis if, the blueprints, et cetera, move either directly or
indirectly in interstate commerce. The preparation of the blueprints, et
cetera, constitutes production of goods for interstate commerce.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>11b02 - Bottled drinks.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees of a bottler of drinks engaged in the
ordering, buying, and receiving of barrels and bottles from out-of-State
sources, or re-shipping or returning them after their contents have been
removed, are engaged in interstate commerce. The fact that the bottled drink is
produced for intrastate commerce and intrastate consumption only is not
material</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees engaged in operations connected with the
making ready of barrels and bottles for the return interstate transit after
their contents have been removed are also individually covered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Whether the employees of an intrastate wholesale
distributor of bottled drinks are covered on an individual basis depends upon
the application of the principles of the Jacksonville Paper case. (See FOH
11w08.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Employees engaged in collecting, loading, returning,
and unloading empty bottles for return to a local bottler for refilling
purposes are individually covered if their employer believes, or has reason to
believe, that the bottles will enter interstate commerce after being refilled.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11b03 - Broadcasting.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of a radio
or TV station which broadcasts news, advertising copy and other program
material received from outside the State are engaged in interstate commerce.
This is so even though all the station’s listeners and advertisers are located
within the State.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11b04 - Building
maintenance and custodial employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Individual coverage of building maintenance and
custodial employees (boiler firemen, building engineers, electricians,
painters, janitors, elevator operators and the like), is to be determined in
accordance with the principles stated in (b) through (d) below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   A maintenance or custodial employee serving the
building or any part of it is individually covered if he or she is regularly
and recurringly engaged in such activities as ordering or receiving goods from
outside the State, handling or otherwise “producing” goods for shipment to
other States, keeping records relative to interstate transactions, or using the
telephone or the mails for interstate communication. Individual coverage on
this basis may arise from a variety of activities. For example, a building
switchboard operator would be individually covered if he or she regularly and
recurringly handles interstate telephone calls for tenants. Likewise, a porter
or elevator operator who regularly and recurringly handles interstate freight
and packages for tenants would be individually covered. Moreover, an elevator
operator is individually covered if letter carriers and parcel post conveyers
regularly and recurringly ride the elevator he or she operates to make
deliveries of letters and parcels which have moved in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   A building maintenance or custodial employee will be
considered to be individually covered if as a regular and recurring part of
their duties they serve those portions of the building occupied by a tenant
engaged in that location in interstate commerce or the production of goods for
interstate commerce. Such an employee will be individually covered, as if he or
she were employed by the tenant himself to perform the covered work. For
example, a janitor would be covered if as a part of their duties they regularly
and recurringly clean those portions of the building occupied by an interstate
insurance firm or a bank (thereby being engaged in the insurance firm’s or
bank’s production of goods for interstate commerce). Likewise, a janitor would
be covered if as a part of their duties they regularly and recurringly clean
those portions of a building occupied by a radio or TV station engaged in
interstate communications. In applying these principles to any employee the
element of substantiality must be taken into consideration. For example, a
janitor would not be considered covered  solely on the basis of taking a few
minutes each day to empty waste baskets in an “interstate” insurance office, or
because, on occasion, called upon outside their regular duties to perform some
incidental cleaning task in a bank. Nor would the performance of maintenance or
custodial services in those portions of the building occupied by an
“essentially local” business provide a basis of coverage, if the same work
would not provide a basis of coverage for a worker employed by such a tenant.
Cases where coverage is questionable will be submitted through channels to the
RS for opinion, including all cases where compliance depends on the application
of these principles to custodial employees who clean only the halls and
corridors outside the portions of the building occupied by “interstate”
tenants, or building engineers whose duties relate to the building in general
(heating air-conditioning, etc.).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Without regard to any other basis of coverage,
maintenance and custodial employees are covered on an individual basis if the
building for which they perform these functions is devoted to interstate
commerce or to the production of goods for interstate commerce to such a
substantial extent that there may be said to be a “close and immediate tie”
between the activities of such employees and the interstate commerce or
production involved. On this basis the Act has been held to cover all building
maintenance and custodial employees in loft buildings where goods are
physically produced for interstate commerce, in headquarters buildings of
companies engaged elsewhere in producing goods for interstate commerce, in
buildings substantially devoted to interstate operations of insurance companies
or government agencies, and in multi-tenant office or other buildings in which
occupants engaged in actual production of goods for commerce on the premises
utilize a substantial portion of the rentable areas for their operations.
Building maintenance and custodial employees are not individually covered by
the Act solely by reason of the fact that they service buildings operated as a
local activity not dedicated in any way to interstate commerce or to the
production of goods for such commerce, which are held out for tenancy by and
are in fact tenanted by the “usual miscellany” of offices, in which no
manufacturing is carried on. In determining whether or not the building as a
whole is so maintained and operated as to have a “close and immediate tie” to
interstate commerce or the production of goods for interstate commerce, it is
not possible to establish precise mathematical formulas based either on the
percentage of rentable space occupied by specific types of tenants or the
extent of commerce or production conducted on the premises. It is necessary to
look at the building as a whole and at the business operations conducted on the
premises by its tenants. Where compliance depends upon such a determination,
the following procedure shall be followed:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  If at least half of the rentable area of the building
is occupied by tenants substantially engaged on the premises in interstate
commerce or the production of goods for interstate commerce, the building as a
whole shall be considered as maintained and operated as an instrumentality of
interstate commerce or an interstate production facility (i.e., there is the
“close and immediate tie”) and all maintenance and custodial employees shall be
considered to be individually covered. (This would clearly apply, for example,
where at lease half of the rentable area is occupied by such tenants as an
interstate insurance company or a bank, or some combination of such tenants.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  If less than half of the rentable area is occupied by
such tenants, the facts shall be obtained and the matter shall be referred
through channels to the RS for opinion. In developing the necessary
information, the approximate rentable area of the building, the types of
tenants, and the business operations conducted by the tenants with particular
reference to whether or not the Inv considers them to fall into the
“interstate” or the “usual miscellany” category shall be included. This
information can be shown by chart or in any appropriate manner with such
explanations as are required. For example, the percentage of rentable area
occupied by “interstate” tenants such as banks, insurance firms, Federal
agencies, manufacturers, and radio and TV stations can be shown in one column;
the percentage of rentable area occupied by the “usual miscellany” of local
tenants such as lawyers, doctors, and real estate agents in another column</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   The principles stated above do not apply to building
maintenance and custodial employees employed by a shopping center which is
composed of individual buildings contiguously located for convenience, having
only party walls as a common ground between tenants. However, such employees
may otherwise be individually covered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   In some cases, employees may be engaged to perform
only activities such as cleaning, waxing, and buffing floors, as opposed to
general janitorial services work. For purposes of individual coverage, such
employees are held in the same light as employees performing general janitorial
service work notwithstanding that their work contributes to the operations of
the customers’ buildings only from an aesthetic point of view and that the
finish on the floor has little preservative effect and does not add
significantly to the wearability of the floor. Thus, such employees are
considered to be individually covered in any w/w in which they perform such
duties in truck terminals, banks, factories producing goods for commerce, etc.
The activities of these employees are distinguished from the activities of
window washers, landscapers or exterminators. (See IB 776.19(b)(5).)</p>

<h3>11c00 - Clerical work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Office and clerical employees who are engaged in the
sending and receiving of out-of-State remittances, letters, bills, contracts,
et cetera, or whose work involves the regular and recurrent use of the
interstate mails, telephone, telegraph, and similar agencies for communication
across State lines, are engaged in interstate commerce. R/K activities,
incident to the sending and receiving of such subjects of interstate commerce,
performed by office and clerical employees are so closely related to the
interstate movement that the R/K employees too are regarded as engaged in
interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Office and clerical employees whose work is performed
in connection with the production of goods or any part or ingredient thereof
for interstate commerce are subject to the FLSA as engaged in the production of
goods for interstate commerce. Those who not only transmit, but also prepare
letters, bills, contracts, and other papers which are sent out of the State,
are actually engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11c01 - Coal strip-mining.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The replacement of
soil performed in connection with the strip-mining of coal, which coal moves in
interstate commerce, is not a process or occupation directly essential to the
production of the coal. Employees engaged only in such activities are therefore
not covered on an individual basis.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11c02 - Collection
agencies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of
collection agencies or collection departments of credit bureaus engaged in the
collection and remittance of funds and negotiable instruments for transmittal
across State lines are engaged in interstate commerce, as are employees engaged
in the preparation of financial reports, statements, correspondence, or other
written material for transmittal across State lines.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11c03 - Communication.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees who are engaged in communicating messages,
information, and reports to points outside the State or in receiving such
matter directly from other States, are engaged in interstate commerce. The
employees included are of two classes, namely those who operate the
instrumentalities by which the interstate communication is effected (telephone,
telegraph, and radio operations), and those who regularly and consistently make
use of such facilities for the interstate sending or receiving of messages
pertaining to their employer’s business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees such as news-gatherers, reporters, and
clerical employees are engaged in activities closely related and directly
essential to the production of the news, et cetera, being transmitted.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11c04 - Concrete drainage
pipe production.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees engaged in
the production of concrete drainage pipe for use or consumption in the
maintenance, repair, or reconstruction of highways, over which interstate
commerce regularly travels, are covered on an individual basis.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11c05 - Construction:
materialmen.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>IB 776.21(b)(2) and
(3), and 776.27(d), contain the official WH position regarding individual
coverage of employees of producers of concrete ready-mixed and other
materialmen.</p>

<h3>11c06 - Construction: new
production facilities.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Under IB 776.26 and 776.27, the construction of a new
factory building or other production facility designed as a replacement,
enlargement, extension or improvement of an existing covered production
facility will be individually covered. IB 776.26 points out that “Coverage of
any construction work, whether new or repair work, depends upon how closely
integrated it is with, and how essential it is to the functioning of, existing
covered facilities. Neither the mere fact that the construction is ‘new
construction’ nor the fact that it is physically separated from an existing
covered plant, is determinative.” Thus the fact that the new plant is located
at a considerable distance from the existing facility will not preclude
individual coverage. If such coverage is present, certain preparatory
operations would likewise be covered under the principles set fourth in IB
776.28(a)(3).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The following examples, while not intended to be
restrictive in any way, are illustrative of some types of construction over
which individual coverage has been asserted under the position set forth in (a)
above:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The construction of a new building in an adjacent town
to expand the operations of an existing plant which will continue to produce
goods for commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The construction of a suburban drive-in branch for an
existing downtown bank. Also, the construction of a building for an existing
bank to serve as a replacement of the bank notwithstanding that the predominant
use of the new structure may be devoted to uses other than banking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The construction of a new factory at a new location to
replace the existing plant of a firm manufacturing goods for commerce although
the new factory is at a substantial distance from the manufacturer’s present
plant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The construction of a new factory outside of the city
limits designed specifically for the purpose of housing a garment factory now
operating in the same town, in rented quarters. The building is being financed
by local subscription under a State program of inducing new industries to move
into or remain in the state. The building when constructed will be leased to
the manufacturer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   If the Inv can make a clear determination that the
construction is individually covered because it falls within any of the four
examples described in (b) above, the investigation may proceed. If not, the
following facts should be developed and the case referred to the RS:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Is the new plant to be coordinated in any way with
production at the existing plant, and if so, how (i.e., will it be used to
produce the complete ultimate product, or will it be used for partial
processing or assembling of products begun, finished, or otherwise processed at
an existing plant)? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Does the new plant include features (in design,
materials or equipment, or otherwise) specifically adapted to the particular
kind of production?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Will there be any transfer of employees or equipment
from the existing plant to the new plant, or will there be any interchange of
employees between the existing and the new plant?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Will there be joint management and operation of the
new and the existing plant, giving any available information on plans for a
joint or segregated management and operation?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Will production start at the new plant before
completion of the construction, and if so, when and to what extent; or how soon
after completion is production at the new plant to start?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Is the new plant being constructed to produce products
for an entirely new set of customers, or is it to meet the needs of the present
source of customers because their current or imminent needs have expanded
beyond the capacity of the existing plant?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  Are there outstanding any specific orders or contracts
which the new plant will be used to fill?</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11c07 - Construction:
connection of water or sewer pipe.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Activities such as
excavating, backfilling, and resurfacing of interstate streets and highways are
not considered individually covered where the only purpose of this construction
work is to connect water or sewer pipes leading from private dwellings or other
nonproduction facilities with a main line.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11c08 - Construction: city
streets.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   IB 776.29(f)(3) states in part as follows: “The
construction, reconstruction or repair of a city street, whether residential or
not, which is part of an interstate highway or which directly connects with any
interstate highway is so closely related to the interstate commerce moving on
the existing highway as to be a part of it”. Therefore, employees performing
activities in connection with such construction are individually covered. The
term “directly connected” would apply in all situations where the streets, city
or otherwise, are constructed as a part of a network of interstate use or
travel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   IB 776.29(f)(3) further states “Construction of other
streets, which are not a part of a public road building program and are
constructed on private property as a part of a new residential development,
will not be considered covered until further clarification from the courts”.
This statement refers exclusively to the construction of such streets. However,
the repair of them is individually covered work if the streets are being regularly
used and are open to interstate commerce even though there has not yet been
State acceptance or dedication. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11c09 - Construction:
missile launching sites.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The construction of
ballistic missile launching sites, sometimes referred to as “complexes” or pads,
constitutes an improvement or extension of existing facilities of interstate
commerce and is thus individually covered.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11c10 - Construction:
out-of-State materials.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Construction materials
received from outside the State are deemed to come to rest when delivered to
the construction site and commerce shall not be considered as continuing during
the actual construction process even though, as is sometimes the case,
particular materials may be so designed or formed that their place in the
finished structure is designated at the time of delivery. Thus, for example,
employees engaged in installing porcelain enamel paneling (such as is used on gasoline
service stations or store fronts) or in erecting prefabricated houses or other
structures are not thereby individually covered where the sole basis for such
coverage would be that the materials have been shipped from out-of-State. Of
course, employees engaged at the construction site in receiving materials which
are still moving interstate commerce would be individually covered under the
Act. (See also FOH 11i04 and 11i05.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11c11 - Correspondence
schools.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees engaged in
the collection of information which is transmitted to other States in the form
of publications, pamphlets, or any other written materials are subject to the
FLSA because they are producing goods for interstate commerce. Those
disseminating information or receiving material from out of the State are
engaged in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11c12 - Cigarette stampers
employed by intrastate distributors.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Whether cigarette
stampers employed by intrastate distributors are covered on an individual basis
depends upon whether they are still in the channels of commerce. It has been
determined that goods come to rest when they are placed in storage in the
warehouse pending the affixing of stamps. However, the goods could not be said
to have come to rest if they had been purchased and stored in the warehouse
pursuant to prior orders or in anticipation of filling specific orders of
specific customers</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11d00 - Domestic service
employees: general.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Domestic service employees, pursuant to the concluding
sentence of FLSA Sec 2(a), are subject to the Act: “The Congress further finds
that the employment of persons in domestic service in households affects
commerce.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Although “domestic service” is not defined therein,
for purposes of the Act a domestic service employee is one who performs work of
a household service nature in or about an employer’s private home. Domestic
service employees include, but are in no way limited to, the following
illustrative occupations:</p>
<p> </p>

</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Covered
domestic service must be performed in a private home which is a fixed place of
abode of an individual or family. A separate and distinct dwelling in an
apartment house or hotel may constitute a home. However, a boarding or lodging
house for the purpose of supplying such services to the public, as a business
enterprise, is not a private home and its employees are therefore not domestic
service employees for the purposes of the Act. Domestic service employees who
accompany their employers on trips, such as a vacation, continue to be covered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Maids and cleaning personnel employed by businesses
furnishing home cleaning services to residential customers are not considered
domestic service employees for purposes of Secs 6(f) and 7(l) of the FLSA.
Typically, home cleaning service employers hire, train, and schedule employees,
and direct and inspect their work. The customer pays the home cleaning service
employer for the services performed. The residential customer does not directly
exercise control over the work performed by employees of the cleaning service.
As indicated in (b) above and Secs 552.3 and 552.101 of Reg 552, a domestic
service employee is one who performs household work in or about his/her
employer’s private home. Thus, an employee of a home cleaning service employer
is not a domestic service employee, and coverage for such employees would be
determined on an individual or enterprise basis.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11d01 - Domestic service
employees: babysitting in or about a private home.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to be subject
to the Act’s monetary provisions, babysitting must be noncasual and performed
in or about a private home of the person by whom the babysitter is employed.
Thus, persons who, in their own homes, care for children are not covered as
employed in domestic service. (However, see FOH 12g03 and 12g16 re possible
employment in a day-care center.)</p>

<h3>11e00 - Electricity, fuel.
gas, power, water, or other energy produced for instrumentalities or interstate
commerce.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees engaged in the production and delivery of
electricity, fuel, gas, power, water, or other energy for use and consumption
by instrumentalities of interstate commerce to aid the movement of the commerce
carried on by the instrumentalities are individually covered. This is so even
though the production, sale, distribution, and consumption is wholly
intrastate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees engaged in the production of energy to
operate the movable facilities of interstate commerce, such as interstate
trucks or railroad rolling stock, or to propel oil through an interstate
pipeline, or to send telephone, telegraph, and radio impulses across State
lines, are individually covered. They are similarly covered by the FLSA where
the energy operates the channels of interstate commerce, such as a drawbridge
which carries an interstate highway, the signal equipment of a railroad along
its road-bed, or the beacon lights at an airport. The same is true when the
energy is used to operate fixed facilities of interstate commerce, such as
freight and passenger terminals, pipeline and electric transmission power
stations, telephone exchanges, and radio and telegraph stations.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11e01 - Electricity, fuel.
gas, power, water, or other energy for producers of goods for interstate
commerce.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees engaged in the production or supply of
electricity, fuel, gas, power, water, or other energy for use or consumption in
the production of goods for interstate commerce are engaged in processes or
occupations closely related and directly essential to the production of the
goods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Where the energy is used not as power, but merely to
heat a building which houses establishments producing goods for interstate
commerce the employees are not individually covered by the FLSA. It should be
noted, however, that where the maintenance of temperature control within the
building is required by special circumstance of production, then the use of the
energy is directly essential to the production.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   In establishments whose employees are subject to the
FLSA for the reasons set forth above, all the employees (maintenance,
custodial, and clerical, as well as operational personnel) of the
energy-producing employer whose work is part of his integrated effort to meet
the power or heating needs of producers of goods for interstate commerce are individually
covered by the FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Employees engaged in the production or supply of water
to farmers within the same State to irrigate their crops or for other use in
production of agricultural goods for out-of-State shipment are individually
covered.</p>
<p>            </p>

<h3>11e02 - Engineering field
employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Field employees of an
engineering company operating solely on an intrastate basis are engaged in the
production of goods for interstate commerce in any workweek in which, at the
time they perform surveys, it can be reasonably anticipated that the
information secured as a result of the survey will leave the State in the form
of plans or other documents.</p>

<h3>11e03 - Experiments,
surveys, and practice operations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees engaged in activities such as research,
experiments, surveys, and practice operations which are performed in
contemplation of, and for the purpose of facilitating, expediting, or improving,
the production of goods for interstate commerce are engaged in processes or
occupations which are closely related and directly essential to the production
of goods for interstate commerce. This is so, even though it is contemplated
that production shall be undertaken only if the experiments or explorations
shall prove successful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees engaged in research, experiments, surveys,
practice operations, and like activities are also subject to the FLSA in that
their activities are in closely related processes or occupations directly
essential to the production of goods for interstate commerce where the reports,
tables, and maps which incorporate the information obtained from such
activities are intended to be shipped in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11e04 - Employment
agencies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Where an employment agency regularly performs
placement services out-of-State or has a recruiting affiliation with other such
employment agencies, various resumes, reports, or other employment data are
sent across State lines. Those employees using the mails and other means of
interstate communication are engaged in commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   If an employment agency merely screens and refers
applicants to the usual miscellany of local customers, some of whom are engaged
in the production of goods for commerce, the employees who handle the
producers’ accounts are not engaged in an occupation closely related and
directly essential to the production of goods for commerce and thus are not
individually covered by the FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   However, if any employment agency engages in
recruitment or renders specialized services for producers of goods for
commerce, and thus acts as a substitute for the employment or personnel office
of the producer, employees whose work is clearly connected with a particular
employer or industry or whose activities are specifically directed to meet the
special personnel needs of producers are individually covered as engaged in an
occupation closely related and directly essential to the production of goods
for commerce. In determining whether the activities of an employment agency are
closer to the substitute function than to the typical agency (b) above, the
following factors should be considered:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Who pays the agency fees?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Is there a continuing contractual relationship between
the employer and the agency?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Is it a large scale recruitment program for particular
producers?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Does the agency actually take part in the selection of
employees or does it merely refer an applicant to possible employers?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Does the agency check references?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Does the producer of goods also advertise and solicit
help directly or does he depend primarily on the agency for his employment
supply?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  Are the efforts of the agency directed primarily to
servicing the job applicant or the employer?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
a determination cannot be made based upon the factors noted above, the matter
should be referred through channels to the RS for an opinion.</p>

<h3>11f00 - Farming.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees engaged in
farming, the production, cultivation, and harvest of vegetables, livestock,
cotton, or dairy products for shipment in interstate commerce are engaged in
production for such commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11f01 - Farmers or farm
groups - migrant labor camps.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Farmers and certain
farm groups (such as cooperatives or associations of various types) operate or
contract for the operation of camp facilities where migrant farm laborers are
housed or fed, or both, while working on growers’ farms in the area. If the
growers’ farm commodities are produced for interstate commerce, the employees
engaged in the maintenance and operation of the migrant camps may be performing
work which is closely related and directly essential to such production. The
facts are very important to such a determination, however. Such employees in camps
maintained to satisfy a legal obligation under the Bracero program (Mexican
contract labor) are considered individually covered. On the other hand, where a
camp is operated merely as a convenience available to migrant workers and not
as an integral and indispensable part of the agricultural operations, we would
not assert individual coverage with respect to camp employees based solely on
their relationships to the agricultural production. Where questionable coverage
exists, the facts should be submitted to the RS.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11f02 - Farm machinery and
equipment manufacture and maintenance.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of an
establishment manufacturing farm machinery and equipment who engage in the
intrastate sale or rental of the machinery and equipment to farmers for use in
the production of goods for interstate commerce as well as those employees
engaged in the maintenance and repair of the machinery and equipment, are
engaged in activities closely related and directly essential to the production
of goods for interstate commerce. This is true also if a piece of the
manufactured machinery is used only for the purpose of clearing a field of
stalks, preparatory to plowing for the next crop. The preparatory clearing of a
field is as compelling a necessity to the planting or seeding operations as
would be the turning of the soil.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11f03 - Farm tile.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Concrete irrigation
pipe is a specialized product designed and produced specifically for irrigation
purposes. Its manufacture, like that of the mine props in IB 776.19(b)(3), is
closely related and directly essential to the production of goods for
interstate commerce. Drainage tile, however, is not so specialized and
individual coverage should not be asserted on the basis of its production for
intrastate sale to or for use by farmers.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11f04 - Feed mills.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   For the present and until further notice, do not
assert individual coverage in any situation in which the sole basis therefor is
the production, sale, and distribution of feed or feed ingredients for use
within the State in the raising of poultry or livestock, even though the
poultry and livestock are raised for commerce. Thus, employees exclusively
engaged in such activities will not be considered as individually covered. (See
IB 776.19(b)(4).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees in this category who inquire as to their
status under the FLSA shall be advised that the court'’ decision in the Garrard
Mills case casts doubt on the interpretative position heretofore held, and the
WH will await further court clarification. Such employees shall be advised of
Sec. 16(b).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Employers shall be informed that although WH is
awaiting court clarification with respect to employees in this category, such
employees may sue under Sec. 16(b).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11f05 - Finance companies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Specialized financial institutions extend installment
credit to dealers. Such companies usually engage in wholesale financing by
means of which a retail dealer is supplied with the funds needed for the
purchase of consumer’s goods at wholesale from the manufacturer. The employees
of such a finance company, whether national or local in scope, are individually
covered when their activities contribute to the financing of goods which move
in interstate commerce from the out-of-State producer to the dealer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Those employees who are engaged in making remittances
in interstate commerce, or who regularly travel between States in the
performance of their duties, are engaged in interstate commerce. In addition,
employees engaged in the compilation and preparation of reports to be sent in
interstate commerce are so closely related to interstate commerce as to be
engaged in interstate commerce, and they are also engaged in the production of
goods for interstate commerce. (See also FOH 11p00  Personal loan companies.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11f06 - Freight
forwarders.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of
establishments which consolidate for interstate shipment freight received from
various other establishments are actually engaged in interstate commerce, or
are so closely related to the transportation of freight in interstate commerce
as to be in interstate commerce.</p>

<h3>11h00 - Highway barrier
production.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees engaged in
the production of highway guard posts, jersey walls, and other barriers used to
direct and control vehicular traffic through areas where highways on which
interstate commerce regularly travels are undergoing maintenance, repair or
reconstruction are covered on an individual basis.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11h01 - Horse racing.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees training or
handling race horses are engaged in the production of goods for interstate
commerce in that the horses will be shipped across State lines.</p>

<h3>11i00 - Ice companies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees engaged in
manufacturing, selling, transporting, and delivering ice used to refrigerate
interstate shipments are subject to the FLSA. It is not material that the ice
may be consumed before the interstate movement is accomplished.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11i01 - Industrial
restaurant and cafeteria employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees of an industrial restaurant or cafeteria
engaged only in such activities as the preparation and serving of food, the
cleaning of dishes and tables, and the like, ordinarily are not subject to the
monetary provisions of the FLSA on individual coverage grounds, but the CL
provisions of Sec. 12(a) apply. It is not material that the restaurant is
operated by the producer of the goods for interstate commerce or by a
concessionaire. The activities of such employees are not directly essential to
the production of the goods shipped in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Where eating facilities are provided in an isolated
location, such as a mining or a lumber camp, cooks and like personnel of the
boarding house or dining hall are engaged in processes and occupations that are
not only closely related but also directly essential to the production of the
goods shipped in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11i02 - Insecticide,
chemical and fertilizer producers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of an
establishment which produces insecticides, chemicals or fertilizers for
agricultural used solely within the State are not engaged in interstate
commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce. Some concerns
sell and actually apply insecticides, chemicals or fertilizers on farms
producing goods for interstate commerce. The employees of such concerns who handle,
load, maintain records, etc., of such activities are individually covered by
the Act.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11i03 - Inspection of
goods in interstate commerce.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees engaged in
the inspection of goods during the time that they are moving in interstate
commerce are engaged in interstate commerce. This applies not only to
inspections that occur during the actual movement in interstate commerce, but
also to those that are made in connection with the commencement or termination
of the interstate movement. For example, inspections made by employees of a
wholesaler receiving goods from outside the State who check the goods prior to
the time they come to rest within the State are individually covered.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11i04 - Installation and
service employees: individual coverage of employees installing equipment,
machinery, or other apparatus distinguished from local activities such as
construction.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees who engage in the installation of apparatus,
equipment, machinery, and similar goods which are still moving in interstate
commerce are individually covered. Whether such goods remain in commerce during
the installation process is determined by both the nature of the contract of
sale and by the character of the installation activities. If there is primarily
a contract for work to be performed and the sale of the goods is incidental
thereto, the installation is considered to be predominantly of a local nature
and individual coverage will not apply. On the other hand, if the contract is
primarily a sale of the goods, individual coverage will apply where it is
determined that the installation activities are a necessary incident to the
sale. In making the latter determination, consideration shall be given to:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  whether the performance of the installation work is
essential to the complete delivery in interstate commerce because of complexity
inherent in the product; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  whether the installation work is inherently intrastate
in character and reasonably separable from the interstate features of the sale.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If
delivery to the customer and installation are accomplished in what practically
amounts to a single operation, the goods would retain their character as goods
in commerce until installation has been completed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   in applying the principles set out in (a) above, the
installation of the goods considered therein shall be distinguished from the
erection of construction materials. (See FOH 11c10.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   In addition to other bases of coverage, installation
or service employees may likewise be individually covered where the
installation or service is the repair, maintenance, extension, or
reconstruction of movable or fixed facilities or channels of interstate
commerce, or of machinery or premises used in the production of goods for
interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11i05 - Installation and
service employees; illustrations of coverage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Bowling alley lanes.  The installation of
prefabricated bowling lanes received from out of the State and pursuant to a
contract of sale is individually covered by the FLSA in that the services of
specially skilled mechanics at the site of installation are required to bring
the bowling lanes into existence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Storm windows and awnings.  The installation of
custom-built storm windows and awnings received from out of the State and
pursuant to contracts of sale is individually covered where no construction-type
operations are involved. However, the installation of plate glass in hotels,
apartment houses, private residences, and the like, is not individually covered
merely because the glass came directly from outside the State.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Machinery.  The erection, supervision, and testing of
a machine and its component parts, which was constructed by an out-of-State
manufacturer who also agreed in the contract of sale to send an engineer to the
site of installation for supervisory and testing purposes, is individually
covered work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Insulation.  Employees installing rock wool insulation
are not individually covered merely because the insulation is received from
outside the State. However, individual coverage may result if the installation
is in a building used for production of goods for interstate commerce or in an
instrumentality of interstate commerce.</p>

<h3>11i06 - Insurance: company
office employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees employed in the home office of an insurance
company are covered on an individual basis if the company operates in more
States than one, or if the activities of the employee involve the regular and
continuous use of the mails and other channels and instrumentalities of
interstate commerce and communication.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees of the home office of a national insurance
company may also be considered as actually producing goods for interstate
commerce. All activity at the home office which contributes to the acceptance
and issuance of an insurance policy constitutes production of goods. This
includes personnel of the underwriting department who determine whether the
insurance application will be accepted and a policy issued, the typist who
fills in the policy form, and those who photostat the application for
attachment to the policy for delivery to the branch office for collection of
the premium.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   If the company operates a branch office, general
agency in a foreign country or in a State other than that in which its home
office is located, or if it reinsures its risks with a reinsurance company
located in another State, it is operating in more than one State. Likewise, if
it insures risks in States other than that in which its home office is located,
or through its own employees, a general agency, or in any other manner,
solicits or sells insurance in other States, collects premiums or assessments
from other States, adjusts cases for loss in other States, sends notices,
applications, policies, and the like, in interstate commerce, or regularly and
continuously uses the channels of interstate commerce in connection with the
investment of surplus and reserve funds, it and its employees so engaged are
engaged in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Branch office employees of an insurance company are
individually covered if the office at or out of which they work is located in a
State other than that in which the home office of the company is located.
Employees of a branch office located in the same State as the home office are
likewise covered if the branch office is operating in more than one State, or
is engaged in the regular and continuous use of the mails and other channels
and instrumentalities of interstate commerce and communication, or if the risks
it insures are reinsured by out-of-State companies.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11i07 - Insurance:
adjusters and inspectors.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The adjusters do not go out-of-State to adjust claims.
Where the policyholder lives outside of the State he or she is met at the site
of burned property or nearby. The adjuster’s report is mailed to his office
within the State. The adjusters have nothing to do with handling reinsurance.
Inspectors examine the properties insured and determine the maximum possible
loss. Their duties do not take them out of the State, nor do they decide the
amount of reinsurance that shall be carried or whether it shall be placed with
out-of-State companies. Adjusters and inspectors are individually covered as
employees of insurance companies which are considered as operating in more than
one State and to the extent that they reinsure risks with reinsurance companies
located outside of the State or reinsure risks for a company located outside of
the State</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Insurance company employees who prepare or aid in the
preparation of letters, reports, documents, and the like, that will leave the
State, as well as those employees who gather the information used as their
basis, are engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce,
regardless of the fact that they adjust losses or inspect properties where the
owners and properties are located within the State.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11i08 - Insurance: agency
or brokerage employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The employees of an
insurance agent or broker are individually covered if the agent or broker
operates in more than one State and the activities of the employees contribute
to the regular and continuous use of the mails and other channels and
instrumentalities of interstate commerce and communication. In addition, where
the functions performed by the agent or broker and his employees are so closely
related to the business carried on by out-of-State insurance companies as to be
deemed an integral part thereof, individual coverage exists. Thus, for example,
where through the employees of a broker or agent, clients within the State
purchase insurance policies from companies located throughout the United
States, such employees are engaged in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11i09 - Insurance: intercompany
organizations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The application of
individual coverage to employees of bureaus performing functions which are
indispensable to the general business of insuring risks, such as adjustment
bureaus, and bureaus engaged in payroll auditing, safety inspections, and
similar “outside” activities, is determined as if they were employees of the
particular risk-bearing company to which their services are rendered rather
than as employees of the bureau.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11i10 - Insurance:
rate-making bureaus.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The requirements of
various State insurance laws for equitable rate-making has resulted in the
formation of voluntary or compulsory rate-making bureaus or organizations, the
function of which is to inspect properties, analyze fire hazards, prepare
surveys, and arrive at a rate; or to compile the statistical data from which
the proper schedule of rates for a particular group of insurance companies is
derived. Where the data so collected is for transmittal in interstate commerce,
the employees of such a bureau are individually covered. Even if it can
definitely be established that such data are not being prepared for transmittal
in interstate commerce, if the insurance companies use such data and are
engaged in interstate commerce, the rate-making function is individually
covered by the FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11i11 - Insurance: salvage
companies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Some inter-company
associations maintain inter-company salvage companies whose function it is to
recondition and sell goods which have been damaged and taken by a member
company at the appraised or agreed value. Such an organization, from the
standpoint of determining the applicability of the FLSA, is in its nature
somewhat of a hybrid, since it might be covered not only by reason of the
principles of coverage peculiar to employees in the insurance business, but
also by reason of the fact that employees of such an organization may be
engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce under
conditions which are in no way peculiar to the insurance industry.</p>

<h3>11i12 - Instrumentalities
of interstate commerce.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees of contractors engaged in maintaining,
repairing, reconstructing, replacing, or extending railroads, ships, highways,
bridges, pipelines, navigable waters of the United States, or other essential
instrumentalities of interstate or foreign commerce are engaged in interstate
commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees engaged in the following operations
performed on essential instrumentalities of interstate commerce are covered on
an individual basis (regardless of whether the instrumentality is in operation
at the time the construction is performed): repairing, maintaining, and
reconstructing bridges; replacing existing bridges with new ones; widening, straightening,
resurfacing, and relocating highways and city streets over which interstate
commerce regularly travels; repaving, repairing, and replacing drainage
facilities, curbs, and sidewalks appurtenant to such highways and streets;
repairing and replacing railroad bridges, viaducts, and right-of-way
maintenance shops; maintaining railroad tracks and roadbeds; repairing,
relocating, and reconstructing telephone lines and other transmission
facilities; repairing and maintaining pipelines; and, repairing and maintaining
dams, dikes, and revetments on navigable waters, where the effect of the work
is to enhance and improve navigable waters as instrumentalities of interstate
commerce. Individual coverage also applies to employees who maintain, repair,
reconstruct, or replace radio broadcasting facilities, harbors and navigable
waters, warehouses, airports, wharves and docks which directly facilitate the
movement of goods in interstate commerce, telephone exchanges, telephone
buildings, and post offices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The planting and maintenance of grass, shrubs, trees
and similar items on highway shoulders, and the control of weeds along highways
are activities directly and vitally connected with the proper maintenance of an
instrumentality of commerce. Employees engaged in such work are individually
covered under FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11i13 - Instrumentality or
production facility - military bases.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Military and defense installations such as air bases
(including helicopter bases), communications centers, naval stations, supply
depots, and the like typically function in their entirety as instrumentalities
of interstate commerce. Employees of contractors engaged in the construction,
reconstruction, operation, maintenance and guarding of all buildings, areas,
and facilities which are provided so such installations may function according
to plan are thus generally covered on an individual basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Where a military installation as a whole (such as an
ordnance plant) functions as a facility for the production of goods (including
written materials) for interstate or foreign commerce, contractors’ employees
who work on all parts of the installation which are a part of the integrated
effort for producing such goods are generally covered on an individual basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   In applying (a) and (b) above, no distinction is
warranted (as a general rule) between employees whose work relates to the
actual production facilities or to the facilities and areas through which the
interstate or foreign commerce moves (or in which the production or movement is
directed or assisted) and other employees whose work is confined to those
supporting facilities or areas which are provided as integral parts of the
installation in order that it may continue to function effectively as planned
without interruption or impairment. The following are examples of such
supporting facilities:</p>
<p> </p>
<div>

<table>
 <tbody><tr>
  <td>
  <p>Barracks,</p>
  </td>

  <p>Quarters for military and civilian personnel,
  including family housing units.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table>

</div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees
whose work relates to such facilities are engaged in interstate commerce or
production for such commerce within the meaning of the Act equally with those
whose work relates to the actual production facilities or areas through which
the actual movement of commerce takes place. Employees engaged in the following
are examples of such employees:</p>
<p> </p>
<div>

<table>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Situations may be encountered where the work performed
by certain employees is so remote from commerce or the production of goods for
commerce, and too insignificant as a factor contributing to the functioning of
the installation as an instrumentality of commerce or interstate production
facility, that WH would not at this time assert individual coverage on the
basis of (a) and (b) above. Employees whose duties have been found to consist
of such a remote or insignificant nature in particular cases include employees
of the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Concessionaires engaged in operating barber shops, photographic
studios, NCO or Officers’ Clubs and shops repairing shoes, radios, watches, TV
sets and the like, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Contractors engaged in work under contracts limited to cutting or
mowing grass or irrigating lawns and seeded areas around buildings (as
distinguished from airstrips, highways or railroads) or on parade grounds, polo
grounds, baseball fields, football fields and golf courses. It should be noted,
however, that employees of contractors engaged in operating concessions or in
grounds maintenance may be subject to individual coverage where it
affirmatively appears from all the facts and circumstances that, at the
particular base, providing such goods and services to base personnel is so
directly and vitally related to their effective participation in the movements
in interstate or foreign commerce to and from the base that without the
provision there of such goods or services the instrumentality of commerce or
production facility would be unable to function as planned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   In situations where the application of the principles
set out in (a) through (d) above is not clear, all of the facts shall be
obtained and transmitted through channels to the RS for an opinion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   There may be situations where the operations or
functions of a military installation are of such mixed or diverse nature, as
for example, the U.S. Air Force Academy, that it would not be realistic to
consider such an installation in its entirety as an interstate production
facility or instrumentality of interstate commerce. In such situations, all the
facts shall be obtained and transmitted through channels to the RS for an
opinion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Armed Services Housing Projects on or in close
proximity to the military installations described in (a) and (b) above are
considered an integral part of such installations and employees engaged in the
construction, operation, and maintenance of such housing units are considered covered
accordingly. If the Armed Services Housing Project is not on or in close
proximity to the military installation, the Inv shall obtain the facts,
including the distance from the installation, whether other communities
intervene, whether it is part of an established community of nonmilitary
personnel and whether it is tenanted exclusively by military and civilian
personnel from the installation, and submit the file through channels to the RS
for an opinion.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11i14 - Instrumentality of
interstate commerce – Canal Zone</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   For purposes of IB 776.11, the Canal Zone in its
entirety is considered an instrumentality of interstate commerce. In the usual
situation, therefore, all employees engaged in work on government contracts for
the construction, maintenance, and servicing of those buildings, areas and
facilities which are provided so that the Canal may function as planned are
covered on an individual basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   In applying the above rule, no distinction is
warranted between employees whose work relates to the physical facilities and
areas through which the interstate or foreign commerce moves and other
employees whose work is confined to supporting facilities or areas which are
provided by the Government as integral parts of its program for using the Zone
as an instrumentality of commerce. Examples of such support facilities, which
typically are necessary for the planned functioning of the Canal, are the
following: barracks, schools, mess halls, civilian and military family housing
units, and the like.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Situations may be encountered where the work performed
by certain employees is so remote from commerce of the production of goods for
commerce, and too insignificant as a factor contributing to the functioning of
Zone facilities as an instrumentality of commerce, that WH would not at this
time assert individual coverage on the basis of (a) and (b) above. Where the
facts in a particular case appear to support such a conclusion, all the facts
shall be transmitted through channels to the RS for an opinion.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11i15 - Intrastate
distribution of goods received from outside the State.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Intrastate
distribution, by sales or otherwise, of goods or information received by the
distributor directly from another State may be a part of the antecedent
interstate movement, and thus constitute engagement in interstate commerce.
Shipment of goods from another State direct to a customer located in the same
State as the distributor who ordered the shipment, constitutes interstate
commerce by virtue of which both the distributor’s employees who procured the
shipment to be made and the customer’s employees who receive the goods at the
end of their interstate movement are covered by the FLSA as being engaged in
interstate commerce. Similarly, shipment of goods from another State to a
distributor who has procured the shipment to be made pursuant to a prior order
from the customer, and transshipment from the distributor to the customer,
constitute interstate commerce, by reason of which the distributor’s employees
who procured the shipment to be made from the other State, who received the
goods, and who delivered them to the customer, are covered by the FLSA as being
engaged in interstate commerce. This rule of coverage is not affected by the
fact that goods received from outside the State are mixed with like goods
originating within the State, so that the intrastate distribution is of goods
received in part only from outside the State.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>11i16 - Investigating
agencies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees engaged in
the investigative and clerical work performed by an independent investigating
agency rendering services to clients who are engaged in the production of goods
for interstate commerce are covered on an individual basis. Clerical employees
who type reports of investigators as to the qualifications of prospective
employees of establishments engaged in the production of goods for interstate
commerce are in processes or occupations closely related and directly essential
to the production of goods for interstate commerce. It is not material that
none of the reports leave the State.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>11L00 - Local or
collateral activities of an interstate producer.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Certain employees of a
producer of goods for interstate commerce may be engaged solely in essentially
local activities that are undertaken by the employer independent of his/her
productive operations, or that are undertaken by him/her as a dispensable
collateral incident to those productive operations. These employees are not
engaged in work closely related or directly essential to the production for
interstate or foreign commerce. (See IB 776.18(b).)</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>11m00 - Machinery and
equipment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees engaged in the manufacture or supply of
machinery or tools and dies used in the production of goods for interstate
commerce are engaged in processes or occupations closely related and directly
essential to the production of the goods. Likewise, those employees engaged in
the reconstruction, installation, repair, and maintenance of such machinery,
tools, dies, or specialized equipment that are, or are contemplated, to be used
in the production of goods for interstate commerce are individually covered.
This is true whether they are employed by the owner and operator of the
machinery or by an independent contractor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees are engaged in processes or occupations
closely related and directly essential to the production of goods for
interstate commerce when they are engaged in:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  producing machinery for sale within the State to
another manufacturer who in turn uses that machinery to produce goods for
interstate commerce,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  producing completed parts for sale to another
manufacturer within the State who installs them as replacements for worn-out
parts in machinery used in the production of goods for interstate commerce,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  repairing or reconstructing machine parts which are
installed within the State in machinery used in the production of goods for
interstate commerce,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  installing within the State new or repaired parts to replace
worn-out parts in machinery used in the production of goods for interstate
commerce,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  repairing or reconstructing used machinery brought by
their employer within the State for sale within the State to manufacturers
engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  office, maintenance, and custodial work which
contribute to the integrated effort of the employer to meet the needs of
producers of goods for interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Employees of an independent employer, who manufactures
or supplies producers of goods for interstate commerce with things as directly
essential to production as electric motors, are in processes or occupations
closely related and directly essential to the production of the goods where the
goods produced by the customer are shipped out of the State. This includes:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  logging trucks for use in hauling logs from the woods
to a mill or railroad,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  mine props for mining operations,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  oil-drilling machinery for the production of oil, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  threshing equipment for the production of grain.</p>

<h3>11m01 - Magazine and
newspaper wholesale distribution.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Where the goods are received from out of State but are
distributed locally, the employees are individually covered. Where there is
that practical continuity of movement of the goods from the out-of-State
sources through the wholesaler to the customer, the employees engaged in
receiving the periodicals, loading them in tucks for delivery to retail
outlets, or in transporting them, are engaged in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees of the “return department” engaged in
stripping front covers from the returned copies for shipment by parcel post to
the out-of-State publisher are engaged in the production of goods for
interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Office and clerical employees are in activities that
are so closely related to the interstate movement of the periodicals as to be
engaged in interstate commerce. They are also in processes or occupations that
are closely related and directly essential to the production of goods for
interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11m02 - Magazine
subscriptions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees in a local
office of an organization that is engaged in securing subscriptions for
magazines from persons throughout the United States are engaged in activities
that are so closely related to the interstate movement of the orders for the
magazines that they are regarded as engaged in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11m03 - Meat packing.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees of intrastate meat packers whose by-products
are shipped out of the State, who engage in the production of by-products, are
engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce. Employees who
handle, slaughter, and dress the livestock, remove the inedible portions,
handle and work on the by-products, fire the boilers, maintain, watch, or guard
the premises, as well as for those who do the office work, are also
individually covered. There is no distinction as to volume or amount of
production for interstate commerce where the shipments are regular and
recurrent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees engaged in the production of by-products for
a meat packer producing or processing meats which are sold for consumption
within the same State are engaged in the production of goods for interstate
commerce if, at the time when they are engaged in the production of the
by-products the employer intends, hopes, expects, or has reason to believe that
the by-products will be sent out of the State in the same or altered form.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Tankage which is waste material or garbage is given to
a rendering company free of charge in winter and during the summer the employer
pays a fee to a rendering company for its removal. The tankage ultimately finds
its way out of State. Since this is only waste material or garbage, there is no
production of goods for interstate commerce. This should be distinguished from
a situation where a by-product is produced and shipped out of the State.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11m04 - Medical care.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Medical personnel,
such as nurses, first aid men and the like, who provide medical and first aid
services at the place of employment for other employees who are engaged in
commerce or in the production of goods for commerce are covered. Coverage is
based on the principle that such employees are engaged in activities which
facilitate commerce and are so proximately related to commerce as to be
properly considered engaged therein or that their activities are closely
related and directly essential to the production of goods for commerce.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>11m05 - Mining, oil and
gas wells.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Mining is an activity
that is production of goods. Among those engaged in production are employees
who drill oil or gas wells and those who pump oil from wells, even though their
employer is not the owner of the land or of the lease, but is an independent
contractor.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>11m06 - Multi-branch
enterprises.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Window dressers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Window dressers of multi-branch establishments who
regularly travel across State lines in the performance of their duties are
engaged in interstate commerce. They may also be covered on the basis of
engaging in interstate commerce if the display materials come from another
State, depending in each case upon where the interstate journey of the display
material ends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Goods from out-of-State that are destined for display
in local outlets of a multi-branch enterprise do not ordinarily come to rest in
a warehouse even though they may not be earmarked for a particular store in a
chain. Display materials remain in interstate commerce until actually put on
display.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Inventory crews.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Inventory crews who regularly travel across State lines in the
performance of their duties are individually covered. Additional bases for
individual coverage are the regular and recurrent use of interstate
communication facilities and the preparation of information for transmission
across State lines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Retail chain employees maintaining perpetual
inventories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Central office employees who are engaged in maintaining perpetual
inventories of merchandise stocked by retail shops of a multi-branch
enterprise, all located within a single State and which receive merchandise
from out of the State, are engaged in interstate commerce when their work
contributes materially to the consummation of the transactions by which
merchandise is received by the retail stores from outside the State</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Employees of warehouse engaged in placing price and
sales tickets on merchandise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Warehouse employees of a multi-branch intrastate retail enterprise who
are engaged in placing tickets containing retail prices, styles, and the like,
on merchandise still in interstate commerce before delivery to the individual
shops are engaged in interstate commerce. Such work is not a sufficient
interruption to the interstate journey to break it.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11m07 - Music service.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Music service
furnished to establishments engaged in the production of goods for interstate
commerce is not an activity closely related and directly essential to the
production of the goods.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>11n00 - Newspapers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees, including
drivers, engaged in the intrastate distribution and delivery of newspapers
containing news received from other States are engaged in activities that are
so closely related to the dissemination of information and advertising received
from other States as to be in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11n01 - Nonprofit research
and educational institutions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of
educational, eleemosynary, or nonprofit organizations may be covered on an
individual basis. This will be so even though they engage in laboratory and
other scientific and industrial research which does not result in anything more
tangible than information. If such information or goods is produced for
interstate commerce, the employees are individually covered. In addition,
employees, such as office and clerical personnel, whose work involves the
regular use of the interstate mails, telegraph, telephone, and similar
instrumentalities for communication across State lines are actually engaged in
interstate commerce.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>11o00 - Oil wells.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees engaged in extracting oil or gas from wells
for shipment in interstate commerce are actually producing goods for interstate
commerce. In addition, those who are engaged in preliminary drilling for oil or
gas are engaged in a process or occupation closely related and directly
essential to the production of the oil or gas. It is not material that the
drilling is performed by an independent contractor, or that the drilling
operations do not result in a producing an oil or gas well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The clearing of land, digging of pits, building of
earthen fire walls and construction of derricks or boiler and pump houses,
preliminary to, and in exclusive connection with, the oil drilling operations
are individually covered by FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Employees engaged in the installation of storage tanks
at the well site, or building slush pits, levees, or dikes to prevent the
flooding of an oil field, the wells of which are producing oil for interstate
commerce, are in processes or occupations closely related and directly
essential to the production of the oil.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   However, employees of a materialman engaged in
supplying material, such as brick or ready-mixed concrete are not closely
related to the production of oil.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   The following processes or occupations are closely
related and directly essential to the production of oil:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  the making of geophysical surveys, where the surveys
are relied upon by the petroleum producing industry as guides to prospective
fields;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  the dismantling or moving of oil well drilling
equipment from a completed oil well to the site of a new well;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  watching or guarding oil well drilling machinery
between the times when one well is completed and another begun.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>11p00 - Personal loan
companies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Specialized financial institutions make loans to
borrowers on their personal notes which are thereafter discounted in bulk by
sale to a discounting organization located in a different State from the loan
company. The employees of the loan company making the loans are so closely
related to the interstate commerce inherent in the interstate transfer of funds
as to become a part thereof. The activities of the employees include interstate
financial transaction analogous to the operations of banks and other financial
institutions and the regular use of the channels and instrumentalities of
interstate commerce in maintaining contact with the affiliated company or
companies as well as in connection with the making of loans and credit
investigations. If the business of the company requires the regular use of
interstate channels of communication with borrowers residing in other States,
the receipt of payments from such accounts, and the collection of such
accounts, the cashiers, stenographers, and other employees involved in these
activities are engaged in interstate commerce. (See also FOH 11f05, Finance
companies.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Where the discounting organization is located within
the same State as the loan company, and the activities of the loan company are
confined within the State, individual coverage does not exist for the
discounting activity.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11p01 - Petroleum products
bulk plants.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Where a distributor receives out-of-State shipments of
petroleum products at a bulk plant for distribution to retail service stations
under long-term leases or contracts, interstate commerce does not end until the
products are received by the retail service stations. It is not necessary that
shipments to the bulk plants be based upon prior specific orders. The temporary
storage at the bulk plants is merely a convenient and intermediate step in the
process of getting them to their final destination.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees who transfer the products from tank cars to
storage tanks and delivery trucks for delivery to retail outlets are actually
engaged in interstate commerce. Those engaged in the maintenance of the bulk
plant equipment are also engaged in interstate commerce, since their activities
of inspecting and servicing motors and pumps used to make the transfer are so
closely related to the movement of the petroleum products in interstate commerce
as to be a part of the movement. Such bulk plants may be considered as fixed
facilities of interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11p02 - Post offices,
mobile truck.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of mobile
truck post offices engaged under contract in the carriage of United States mails
are engaged in interstate commerce, since they are either transporting goods
across State lines or as part of the stream of interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11p03 - Printing
establishments.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of printing
establishments engaged in printing forms, catalogues, directories, documents,
letterheads, greeting cards, and advertising materials are engaged in the
production of goods for interstate commerce where the employer knows or has
reason to believe that the goods will be taken or sent out of the State by a
subsequent purchaser or other person into whose possession the goods will come.</p>

<h3>11p04 - Printing ink
supply establishments.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees engaged in
producing ink which is purchased by a local establishment to print paper
shipped in interstate commerce are producing goods for interstate commerce,
since the ink is a part or ingredient of the goods (paper) which move in
interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11p05 - Processing -
Effect on interstate commerce.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Processing generally interrupts the movement of goods
in interstate commerce. Individual coverage may exist on other grounds,
however. The line to be drawn between operations that constitute a mere
incident of the interstate distribution of goods received from outside the
State and those that constitute processing that terminates the prior interstate
movement is a matter of degree. It is not possible to formulate any infallible
test that will serve to resolve every conceivable situation that may arise. It
is not necessarily true that any processing defined as “production” in FLSA Sec
3(j) is sufficient to break the flow of goods in interstate commerce. The test
of what constitutes processing involves a number of factors, including the
complexity of the operation, the change that is made in the goods, and the time
required.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Operations that have been held only incidental to
interstate distribution, and which will not stop the flow of interstate
commerce, include: the making of minor adjustments and performing minor services
on new automobiles; the blending of different grades of gasoline; and the
candling, sizing, and packing of eggs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Among operations that have been held to be processing
are: the mixing of materials to make concrete; the making of sandwiches and
other such products from crackers, bread, and the like; the pasteurization and
bottling of unpasteurized beer; the blending of wines; the grinding or blending
of coffee; the dilution, pasteurization, clarification and homogenization of
milk or cream; the bottling of milk; the neutralization and churning of sour
cream to form butter the processing of cottage cheese to improve consistency
and increase fat content; and, the making of chocolate milk.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>11r00 - Refrigerator
equipment servicemen.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Individual coverage
does not generally extend to a service employee if his or her work consists
solely of repair and maintenance work within the State on refrigeration
equipment for retail stores or other local customers who are not engaged in the
production of goods for interstate or foreign commerce, even though he or she
may be employed by a distributor who is engaged in interstate commerce.
However, where the terms of an interstate contract of sale call for the
installation of the equipment, and specifically provide for the servicing of
the equipment for a period subsequent to its installation, employees who
service the equipment pursuant to the terms of the interstate contract would be
individually covered by the FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11r01 - Retail and
service.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees of even primarily local retail and service
establishments can be individually covered. Examples of covered activities
include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  ordering of supplies and goods by mail, telephone, and
fax and receipt of goods ordered from out-of-state suppliers;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  processing of credit card purchases such as
preparation of credit card slip initiating a transaction with an out-of-state
credit card company or transmission of a credit card check to an out-of-state
clearinghouse; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  transmission of information regarding a customer’s
personal check to an out-of-state clearinghouse for approval.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   In addition to those examples noted in (a) above,
employees of retail chains with out-of-state main offices are frequently
individually covered because of their regular contacts by mail, telephone, fax,
etc. with the main office.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>11s00 - Sand and gravel.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of a sand
and gravel company which sells its products to a local tile manufacturer who
uses it in the manufacture of drainage tile for sale to local farmers engaged
in the production of goods for interstate commerce, are not engaged in
processes or occupations closely related and directly essential to the
production of the farm products which may be shipped out of the State.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11s01 - Savings and loan
associations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of savings
and loan associations, like those of banks, which make loans to persons
residing in other States and take as security property located in other States,
are engaged in interstate commerce. The sale of stock by such associations to,
or the acceptance of deposits of the Federal Government also frequently involve
commercial transactions across State lines. The bank may be engaged in
interstate commerce because of membership in a Federal Home Loan Bank. The
insuring of accounts with the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation
constitutes engagement in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11s02 - Shopping analysts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Traveling analysts,
who investigate the efficiency of sales personnel of various stores throughout
the country and forward or carry reports back across State lines to their
headquarters, are engaged in interstate commerce and production of goods for
interstate commerce in any workweek in which the analysts are engaged in
“handling, transporting, or in any other manner working” on reports, copies of
which move across State lines. Individual coverage may also be asserted on the
basis that the work performed by the analyst is closely related and directly
essential to the production of goods for interstate commerce, if the customer’s
establishment produces goods for interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11s03 - Sign installation
or painting.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees engaged in the installation, maintenance, or
servicing of signs which are installed on the premises or in front of an
instrumentality of interstate commerce, or which are installed within the
structure to indicate the location of terminal or other facilities or to direct
customers or passengers in the use of the instrumentality, are engaged in
activities so closely related to interstate commerce as to be a component part
thereof.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees engaged in the installation, maintenance, or
servicing of signs on factories producing goods for interstate commerce, the
signs identifying the structure as well as incidentally advertising the
business, are not performing work which is closely related to the production of
goods for interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Employees engaged in painting signs on trucks which
are regularly engaged in interstate commerce are covered on an individual
basis.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11s04 - Stock brokerage
houses.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of stock
brokerage businesses are ordinarily engaged in interstate commerce. Employees
engaged in the sale, purchase, transmittal, and receipt of bonds, shares of
stock, and other securities to and from out-of-State customers and sources are
directly engaged in interstate commerce. Registered representatives, customers’
men, and clerical employees performing work directly related to such sales,
purchases, transfers, transmittals, and receipts are engaged in activities
which are so closely related to the interstate movement of the securities as to
be engagement in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11s05 - Students and
instructors repairing planes.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where planes moving or
used in interstate commerce are worked upon by students under instructor
supervision, such students and instructors are engaged in the production of
goods for interstate commerce. The work is productive work and the fact that
its performance is part of training for which no compensation is paid to
students or to the school would not take the students and instructors out of
the category of employees producing goods for interstate commerce. (See FOH
11t08 and 10b11.)</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>11t00 - Telephone
answering service.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   A telephone answering service which offers to and does
in fact receive and transmit interstate telephone messages holds itself out as
being engaged in the channels of interstate commerce and in the operation of an
instrumentality of interstate commerce. It is not material that the percentage
of interstate calls is small, so long as the service is prepared to handle them
and they are regularly received and transmitted. Employees of such a telephone
answering service who are engaged in receiving and transmitting telephone
messages are continuously covered under the FLSA on an individual basis as
being engaged in interstate commerce, notwithstanding that in particular
workweeks no interstate telephone calls or messages regarding such calls are
received or transmitted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees of a telephone answering service who spend
more than an insignificant amount of their time handling telephone
communications for establishments engaged in the production of goods for
interstate commerce are engaged in closely related processes or occupations
directly essential to the production of such goods for interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11t01 - Telephone
solicitors.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Telephone solicitors
may also be engaged in commerce or in a closely related process or occupation
directly essential to the production of goods for commerce. Solicitors who make
calls out-of-State are clearly engaged in commerce. Solicitors who make only
intrastate calls are also covered individually if the checks and bank drafts
received pursuant to their solicitations are sent out of State by their
employer. Similarly, such intrastate callers are covered individually if they
work for organizations that operate on a national or multi-state basis, since
their solicitations are closely related and directly essential to such
organizations’ interstate activities.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11t02 - Telephone and
telegraph pole production.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees engaged in
the production or supply of telephone or telegraph poles for use in the
necessary repair, maintenance, or improvement of interstate communication
systems are covered. Such poles are produced to supply the needs of interstate
communication.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11t03 - Test pilots.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Test pilots are
engaged in an occupation closely related and directly essential to the
production of airplanes for interstate commerce by their employer.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11t04 - Theatrical booking
agencies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of an
employer who acts as a theatrical booking agency, or as manager and
representative of various theatrical performers, band leaders, and radio
artists may be subject to the FLSA on the basis of individual coverage. Where
such an agent arranges performances throughout the United States, his or her
employees may be directly engaged in interstate commerce, in connection with
the carrying on of interstate activities. This is true also of employees of a
motion picture company which books motion pictures to be displayed in theaters
throughout the country.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>11t05 - Theatricals.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of circuses,
carnivals, and road shows who in the performance of their work are regularly
engaged in traveling across State lines are individually covered. Employees
engaged in similar work at a fixed location are not so covered as such work has
no connection with interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11t06 - Toll road
employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of a toll
road company are engaged in interstate commerce where vehicles move in interstate
commerce over the toll road. Those who operate the road and operate a bridge
which carries the highway are engaged in interstate commerce. Those employees
who repair, maintain, and service the toll road are in activities so closely
related to the interstate movement of goods transported over the road as also
to be engaged in interstate commerce.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>11t07 - Trailers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An establishment
engaged in the manufacture or repair of trailers which it will sell or rent for
carrying goods in interstate commerce is engaged in the production of goods for
interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11t08 - Trainees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If trainees who are
employees within the meaning of FLSA (see FOH 10b11 and FOH 10b12) work solely
on scrap materials which do not leave the State, they are not covered on an individual
basis. Such employees may, however, be covered as employed in an enterprise
described in FLSA Sec 3(s).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11t09 - Transportation.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Transportation of semi-finished goods between
production plants within the State is covered as part of the productive process
if the finished goods are to be shipped outside the State.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The concept of transportation as an aspect of
interstate movement is not limited to the transportation that, in the narrowest
view, involves the crossing of a State line. An employee is engaged in
interstate commerce if he or she is engaged in the hauling of goods or persons
that are in transit to or from another State. Intrastate transportation is a
part of interstate commerce if it forms a part of one larger movement in the course
of which a State line is crossed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The loading of goods onto a conveyance for
transportation in interstate commerce constitutes engagement in interstate
commerce, and unloading and reloading at any point in the interstate journey is
of the same character. Similarly, the unloading of goods at the end of their
transportation in interstate commerce is engagement in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Coverage under the FLSA on the basis of engagement in
interstate commerce through engagement in transportation is not confined to
persons who are immediately concerned in the foregoing activities. Included
also are employees whose activities are so closely related thereto as to be,
for all practical purposes, a part thereof, such as inspectors, investigators,
freight agents, clerical employees, stockroom clerks, and red caps.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>11t10 - Transportation
terminals.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Transportation terminals, through which flow goods,
freight, or passengers moving in interstate commerce, are fixed facilities of
interstate commerce. As a general rule, employees engaged in work in or about
such fixed facilities of interstate commerce are subject to the FLSA as they
are engaged in interstate commerce, or so closely related to the flow of goods
through the terminals as to be regarded as engaged in interstate commerce. This
is applicable to operational, maintenance, custodial, and clerical employees of
the terminals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Certain employees engaged in work at the terminal
providing services or facilities which those carrying on interstate commerce
may use are not covered on an individual basis. This will apply whether such
personnel are employed by the instrumentality of interstate commerce which
operates the terminal or by the an independent employer or concessionaire. For
example, employees of drug stores, lunch counters, newsstands, barbershops, and
shoeshine parlors are not closely enough related to the movement of goods
through the terminals to be regarded as engaged in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   A terminal porter who not only keeps the station clean
but also assists passengers with their baggage and employees of an
establishment owning and operating coin-actuated baggage lockers installed in
stations are engaged in a terminal service so closely related to the physical
transportation of goods and passengers in interstate commerce as to be a part
of interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11t11 - Travel.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of a travel
agency who are engaged in the sale of transportation tickets for interstate or
foreign travel, or who conduct interstate sight-seeing tours, are individually covered
by the FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11t12 - Truck renting
companies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees of establishments engaged in the business of
leasing or renting trucks on a “drive-it-yourself” system are covered on an
individual basis in any workweek in which they are engaged in:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  maintaining, servicing, and repairing vehicles which
are used on a regular and recurrent basis to transport goods in interstate
commerce. (This includes not only vehicles used to transport goods directly
across State lines, but also those used to transport goods from a wholesale
establishment to another point within the same State, if such distribution is
covered under the principles of the Jacksonville Paper case. See FOH 11w08.);</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  maintaining, servicing and repairing vehicles used in
the production of goods for interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees who receive and re-ship vehicles received
from another State which have not come to rest are engaged in interstate
commerce. Employees whose activities relate to clerical duties connected with
such receipt and shipment are so closely related to the movement in interstate
commerce as to be also regarded as engaged in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Employees engaged in maintenance, service, and repair
activities, and the clerical duties connected with the rental and use of vehicles
on a regular basis to transport goods in interstate commerce are engaged in
interstate commerce and the production of goods (vehicles) for interstate
commerce.  Clerical duties include related bookkeeping, waiting on customers,
checking out of cars and trucks, making out shop-repairs orders, and similar
activities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Employees engaged in maintaining, servicing, and
repairing vehicles used in the production of goods for interstate commerce are
in closely related processes or occupations directly essential to the
production of goods for interstate commerce.  All of the employees, including
watchmen and porters, who are part of their employer’s integrated effort to
supply to producers of goods for interstate commerce the vehicles used in
production of goods are similarly individually covered.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>11v00 - Vending machines.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Vending machine goods
received from out-of-State sources remain “in commerce” under the Jacksonville
Paper (See FOH 11w08.) rule through the warehouse where initially received in a
State and until placed in vending machines within the same State. Thus, for
example a routeman employed to stock vending machines with such goods is
engaged in individually covered work.  (See FOH 24c03.)</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>11w00 - Warehousing:
controlling principles.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees of a warehouse, the storage facilities of
which are used in the course of interstate transportation and distribution of
goods, are engaged in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The unloading, inspecting, and checking of goods
received at warehouse from outside the State, and the keeping of records with
respect thereto, constitute engagement in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Whether employees engaged in and about a warehouse in
handling goods after their receipt from outside the State are engaged in
interstate commerce, depends upon the disposition and destination of the goods
after they leave the warehouse. In those situations where the flow of
interstate commerce terminates upon receipt of the goods at the warehouse, only
those employees are individually covered whose activities pertain to the
receipt of the goods. In situations where the flow of interstate commerce
continues through or begins after the warehousing operations, all employees are
individually covered who participate in any of the work through which goods are
received, stored, or distributed, or in any activities so closely related
thereto as to be a part thereof.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Where goods are received from outside the State and
stored in bulk warehouses, the stream of interstate commerce does not
necessarily end there, but may continue until the goods are delivered from the
warehouse to a dealer or consumer. In the case of subsequent distribution
within the same State, if the goods belong to a wholesaler who will distribute
them to retailers or other wholesalers, the warehouse employees who handle the
goods during their stay in the warehouse and who deliver them to the retailers
or wholesalers, may be engaged in interstate commerce under the principles of
the Jacksonville Paper case. (See FOH 11w08.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Goods that are destined for another State may be
considered to be moving in interstate commerce even prior to their crossing of
a State line. Hence, the temporary storage of such goods may be considered
engagement in interstate commerce, depending upon the circumstances of such
storage with relation to previous and subsequent movement of the goods. All
employees in the ordinary warehouse serving chain stores which receives goods
from outside the State are individually covered even though the distribution
may be entirely intrastate. A similar result will follow where the distribution
of the warehouse or wholesale house is confined to a limited group of
retailers, such as wholesalers who distribute only to members of a particular
association of retail stores.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11w01 - Warehousing: chain
store.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees of a chain store warehouse engaged in
storing out-of-State merchandise for direct shipment to customers of several
retail stores are covered on an individual basis. However, whether a particular
employee is so covered depends upon his or her own activities. Normally,
warehouse employees of such chain stores “are performing wholesale duties in
the very midst of the stream of interstate commerce”, and they “customarily
deal with both incoming and outgoing interstate shipments”. However, if an individual’s
work is in no way concerned with the interstate aspect of his or her employer’s
business, then he or she is not individually covered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   A repair and service facility, even though conducted
in a chain store warehouse servicing retail stores, is to be distinguished in
its activities from the process of wholesaling. Employees whose activities are
confined solely to delivery, repair, and servicing of merchandise which has
already reached the retail stores or which has been sold to retail customers by
the retail stores are not individually covered by the FLSA if all of the
merchandise is delivered within the State in which the chain store warehouse is
located.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11w02 - Washers, car or bus.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Car or bus washers
employed by an interstate bus line, and engaged in work either at the terminal
or at the company garage, are engaged in work so closely related to the
movement of goods in interstate commerce as to be engagement in interstate
commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11w03 - Waste material,
scrap metal and junk.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The collection, reconditioning, reprocessing,
salvaging, sorting, loading, unloading or otherwise working on or handling
waste material, scrap metal or junk for shipment out of the State, is covered
on an individual basis. For example, the loading of scrap metal on railroad
cars for interstate shipment constitutes engagement in interstate commerce.
Likewise, operations performed on waste paper, rags or metal for shipment,
directly or indirectly out of the State or for use by producers in the
manufacture of goods to be shipped out of the state, such as paper boxes,
reclaimed woolens and the like, is the production of goods for interstate
commerce since such materials are a part or ingredient of the goods produced
which ultimately move in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The removal of waste material, scrap metal and junk
from establishments that are engaged in the production of goods for interstate
commerce is covered on an individual basis. The removal of such waste material
is closely related and directly essential to the production of such goods. It
is immaterial that the waste material is picked up at the door of such an
establishment or from the adjoining alley or sidewalk, or that it does not
subsequently move in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11w04 Watching and guarding.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Personnel engaged in watching and guarding buildings,
premises, equipment and other goods may be subject to the FLSA as either
engaged in interstate commerce, or in the production of goods for interstate
commerce. Employees engaged in watching or guarding the following instrumentalities
of interstate commerce are engaged in interstate commerce:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  movable facilities of interstate commerce, such as
trucks, railroad cars, or ships, whether empty or loaded;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  fixed facilities of interstate commerce, such as
interstate warehouse buildings, freight and passenger terminals, power
transmission buildings, telephone exchanges, and radio stations; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  covered construction of the channels of interstate
commerce, such as interstate highways, waterways, and railroad roadbeds. This
is true even though the watchman is employed by an independent protective
agency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   watchman who is employed at a fixed facility of
interstate commerce, such as a warehouse or distribution depot devoted to the
receipt and shipment of goods in interstate commerce is covered on an
individual basis. Similarly, an employee who watches goods which by their
nature have not yet come to rest is engaged in activities closely enough
related to interstate commerce to be engagement in interstate commerce. For
example, if he watches trucks freight cars, and boats prior to the unloading of
out-of-State goods, his work is individually covered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Employees engaged in watching or guarding buildings,
premises, equipment, materials, or other goods that are being used in the
production of goods for interstate commerce are subject to the FLSA as being
engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce. They are in
processes or occupations that are closely related and directly essential to the
production of goods watched or guarded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   It is not necessary that the production operations
must be carried on at the precise moment that the watching or guarding is done.
If that which the employee guards is used regularly in the day time in the
production of goods for interstate commerce, the night watchman is covered. Nor
is it material that the plant which he or she guards is temporarily shut down,
although for a fairly long period. However, where production has definitely
ceased and no further production is being contemplated, the watching or
guarding cannot be said to be closely related and directly essential to the
production of any goods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Whether a watchman who watches building materials on
construction jobs is individually covered depends upon the nature of the
construction job. In general, the watchman stands in the same position as other
employees, such as carpenters and laborers. Where the other employees are
subject to the Act because they are in processes or occupations that are
closely related and directly essential to the production of goods for
interstate commerce, the guard is individually covered. For example, employees,
including watchmen engaged in the maintenance, repair, reconstruction,
improvement, or extension of facilities used in the production of goods for
interstate commerce are in closely related processes or occupations directly
essential to the production thereof. Similarly, such work in connection with
fixed facilities and channels of interstate commerce, such as warehouse
buildings, freight and passenger terminals, pipeline stations, telephone
exchanges, radio stations, interstate highways, waterways, and railroad
roadbeds, is so closely related to the interstate movement of goods through or
over them as to be engagement in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11w05 - Wholesaling: general
considerations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees engaged in activities characteristic of the
wholesaling business may be engaged in interstate commerce by virtue of their
connection with the procurement or receipt of goods received directly from
outside the State, the handling and distribution of goods moving in interstate
commerce, or the original shipment of goods out of the State.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees of a wholesaler who participate in the sale,
shipment, et cetera, of goods to points outside the State are engaged in
interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Employees of wholesalers (with the exception of
employees engaged in work relating to the ordering and receipt of merchandise
from outside the State) are not individually covered, if the wholesaler brings
goods into the State for general distribution to the trade, stores them to
await orders, and then distributes them on order.</p>

<h3>11w06 - Wholesaling: receipt
of out-of-State goods.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees of a wholesaler who are engaged in the
procurement and receipt of goods from outside the State are engaged in
interstate commerce without regard to the nature of the employer’s business or
the subsequent disposition of the goods. This is true whether the goods are
received by the wholesaler or directly by the customer on behalf of whom they
were procured to be shipped. Included within the coverage of the FLSA on this
basis are employees whose work is so closely related to the actual procurement
or receipt of the goods as to be, for all practical purposes, a part thereof.
For example, employees who keep records of interstate purchases and goods
received, maintain the accounts payable ledger, and other allied and receiving
employees, are so closely related to the interstate movement of the goods as to
be engaged in interstate commerce. Moreover, maintenance and custodial
employees of such a wholesale establishment are covered on an individual basis
for similar reasons. For example, maintenance employees engaged in repairing
the materials-handling equipment, the watchman who protects goods prior to
unloading, and the janitor who cleans the office of the wholesaler are likewise
so closely related to the movement of the goods ordered and received as to be
engaged in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The coverage of the employees whose activities are
performed with respect to the out-of-State goods while such goods are in or
about the establishment of the wholesaler is determined by the status of the
goods at the time of the performance of the activity in question. If at that
time the goods are in fact still in the stream of interstate commerce,
performance of work connected therewith by any employee will be either actual
engagement in interstate commerce or so closely related thereto as to be
regarded as part thereof.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11w07 - Wholesaling: where
out-of-State goods come to rest.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Out-of-State goods of an intrastate wholesaler do not
come to rest until they reach the destination intended for them by the
importer. Normally, the destination intended for goods received for storage and
subsequent distribution in intrastate commerce is the place where they are held
for future distribution, such as shelves or storage bins, rather than the first
place at which they are set after unloading from the carrier. The fact that
there may be some delay in moving the goods from the point of unloading to the
shelves or bins is an immaterial circumstance which does not alter the results.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Thus any employee whose duties relate to the ordering
of goods from other States is subject to the FLSA as engaged in interstate
commerce. This will include not only those who make telephone calls or send
telegrams, or write letters, or handle payments, all in connection with such
purchases, but also employees who keep records of purchases, orders, and
receipts, or in any manner perform work which is materially related to the
purchases.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Employees engaged in receiving out-of-State goods are
actually engaged in interstate commerce, and those whose work is materially
related thereto are so closely related to the interstate movement as to be
engaged in interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Any employee whose duties includes the performance of
the following types of work, even after the out-of-State goods have been
unloaded and deposited on the unloading platform or warehouse floor, is engaged
in interstate commerce:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  checking goods against invoices;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  placing goods on shelves or in storage bins;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  making reports on missing or damaged goods; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  entering articles received in interstate commerce in
the stock book. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11w08 - Wholesaling: prior
orders, pre-existent understandings, and anticipation of needs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The Supreme Court, in the Jacksonville Paper Company
case, has defined those conditions under which goods remain within the channels
of interstate commerce until delivered to the customer level. The first group
comprises those goods purchased by the wholesaler upon the order of a customer
with the definite intention that the goods shall be carried at once to the
customer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The second group comprises those goods obtained by the
wholesaler from the manufacturer or supplier to meet the needs of specified
customers pursuant to some understanding with the customer even though not
necessarily for immediate delivery. The Court ruled that the goods comprising
each of these two groups are within the channels of interstate commerce until
delivery is finally effected to the specific customer, known and intended at
the time of purchase by the wholesaler.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The third group comprises those goods the orders for
which have been based, by the wholesaler, on anticipation of the needs of a
stable group of specific customers rather than upon prior orders or
understandings.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11w09 - Wholesaling: chain
store distribution.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In the American Stores
case, the Court of Appeals held that where the warehouse and the retail stores,
located within the same State, are part of an integrated unit, goods do not
come to rest in the warehouse in the sense that the flow of goods in interstate
commerce has been terminated. Thus, all employees in the ordinary chain store
warehouse receiving goods from outside the State are individually covered, even
though the distribution effected is entirely intrastate. Likewise, the
employees would be individually covered where the distribution of the warehouse
or wholesale house is confined to a limited group of retailers, such as
wholesalers who distribute only to members of a particular association of
retail stores or to a limited number of retailers who handle the particular
product or brand.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11w10 - Wholesaling:
interstate shipment by wholesaler.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of a
wholesaler who participate in the sale or shipment of goods outside of the
State are engaged in interstate commerce. The movement of the goods is
initiated by the employee who first removes them from the point at which
previously stored for future distribution; all employees whose duties are
thereafter related to such movement are individually covered. This broad group
includes such typical and illustrative occupations as order pickers, checkers,
packers, shipping clerks, loaders, clerical and office employees who keep
records or prepare correspondence relative to either the sale or the movement
of the goods, and maintenance and custodial employees, including watchmen and
janitors.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11w11 - Wholesaling: second
wholesalers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If, in fact, the
movement of goods in interstate commerce has ceased in the establishment of the
first wholesaler, the subsequent handling of such goods by the employees of the
second wholesaler is not covered on an individual basis, unless or until the second
wholesaler initiates a new movement in interstate commerce. However, if the
goods have remained in interstate commerce through the establishment of the
first wholesaler, the receipt of such goods in the establishment of the second
wholesaler is the same as receiving the goods directly from outside the State
and is therefore individually covered. Similarly, if the second wholesaler
receives the out-of-State goods by direct consignment or by drop-shipment from
their out-of-State source, they are deemed to have been received directly from
outside the State. Those employees who in any manner perform work which is
materially related to the purchase or receipt of such goods prior to their
arrival at their intended destination are covered on an individual basis.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11w12 - Woods and mine crew
auxiliary employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of an
isolated lumber or mining camp such as cooks, kitchen helpers, timekeepers, and
repair shop mechanics who are engaged solely in connection with, and for the
purpose of aiding FLSA covered productive activities are engaged in a closely
related process or occupation directly essential to the production of goods for
interstate commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>11w13 - Wrecking contractor.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees of a wrecking contractor engaged in
demolition work and in the sale of the salvaged parts are covered on an
individual basis where the employer has reason to believe that part of the
salvaged material will move in interstate commerce or will become part of goods
that are shipped in interstate commerce, whether as a result of a direct sale
by the employer or indirectly as a result of its disposition by his customer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Individual coverage also exists where the employees
are engaged partially or wholly in wrecking buildings as a part of the
reconstruction, remodeling, or expansion of facilities used in the production
of goods for interstate or foreign commerce, whether the employees are engaged
in work at the job site, such as office and clerical workers, watchmen and
guards, employees maintaining and repairing equipment used on the job, or
employees transporting such equipment to and from the job site</p>

<h3>12a00 - Statutory definition and IB.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
FLSA Sec 3(r) defines the
“enterprise” which is the business unit tested for coverage under Sec 3(s). IB
779.200 through 779.235 contains the official Wage-Hour interpretations
regarding the principles which determine the activities which are included
within an enterprise for purposes of the Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
Effective 7/1/72, the Education
Amendments of 1972 amended Sec 3(r)(1) to include preschools within the
coverage of the Act. Sec (r)(1) as amended reads as follows: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“(1) in connection with the operation of a hospital, an institution
primarily engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, the mentally ill or
defective who reside on the premises of such institution a. school for mentally
or physically handicapped or gifted children, a preschool, elementary or secondary
school, or an institution of higher education (regardless of whether or not
such hospital, institution or school is public or private or operated for
profit or not for profit), or”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
Effective 5/1/74, the 1974
Amendments amended Sec 3(r) to include all public agencies within coverage of
the Act. Sec 3(r)(3) of the amended Act reads as follows: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“(3)           in connection with the activities of a public agency”.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12a01  - Common ownership.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Sec 3(r) does not require unified
operation if there is common control. Further, common ownership may in certain
situations be sufficient to establish the common control required by the Act
(see IB 779.215 and 779.222). It does not necessarily follow, however, that the
activities which are thus commonly controlled are related and performed through
such common control for a common business purpose so as to bring them all
within a single enterprise. A determination as to whether or not these tests
are met requires that the total situation be considered and that each of the tests
be viewed realistically in the context of the others rather than solely in
isolation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
While the facts in each case will
be determinative of whether the tests of Sec 3(r) are met, the following
excerpts from recent opinions will serve to illustrate the application of the
principles set out in (a) above in situations where common ownership was a
factor to be considered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  A parent corporation, characterized as a holding
company or finance and investment group, owns and controls numerous subsidiary
corporations. The latter are engaged, respectively, in such diversified
activities as retail hardware, animal feed manufacture, building management,
mortgage loans, steel container manufacture, and so on. The opinion stated: “A
holding corporation may be organized and operated for investment purposes and
the facts may show in a particular case that the activities of its operating
subsidiaries are not actually related activities performed through common
control for a common business purpose but are separately performed for
different corporate purposes contained in the separate corporate charters. A
different situation would be presented, of course, if it appeared that the
holding company, under authority of its charter, was in fact performing with
its subsidiaries through common control a combination of related activities in
which the various corporations are engaged, and that such activities were all
related to, and performed for, a unitary business purpose for which the holding
company was formed and which is common to all such activities”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Two brothers live, respectively, in cities A and B.
They have for several years owned a retail grocery supermarket, as equal
partners. This supermarket is operated by a manager who is in active charge of
the store. One of the brothers individually purchased an operating grocery
store in another town. This store is operated by a full-time manager who makes
daily reports to the owner brother. He makes no reports to the other brother.
The operation of the two stores is not unified in any way. An issue was raised
as to whether the activities of the two stores are related activities performed
for a common business purpose. The opinion stated: “The activities in question
are related in kind, since they are those of retail stores. The question
remains, however, as to whether they are, within the meaning of Sec 3(r),
related activities performed through common control for a common business
purpose. It is true, as stated in IB 779.212, that the term “common business
purpose” as used in Sec 3(r) does not have a narrow concept and is not intended
to be limited to a single business establishment or a single type of business.
But where, as here, there are related activities having no functional
interdependence and they are separately conducted to serve the business purpose
of the partnership on the one hand and the business purpose of one brother
individually on the other, we are not prepared to say that the requirement of
performance ‘through common control’ of ‘related activities’ for a ‘common business
purpose’ is sufficiently met”.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12a02 - Country and town clubs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Country and town clubs, even
though nonprofit organizations, which are organized and operated exclusively by
and for the pleasure and recreational purposes of a select group of persons
specially selected for membership (or their guests), are considered to be
operated for a “business purpose” within the meaning of Sec 3(r). There is no
exclusion in the Act for pleasure or recreational clubs and the activities of
such clubs do not fall within the “nonprofit educational, religious and
eleemosynary” activities set forth in IR 779.214. The fact that a membership
organization is formed for the purpose of providing facilities or services to
its members only does not remove it from the sphere of business. (See IB
779.317 and FOH 25j06.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
Included in the ADV of such a club
enterprise are initiation fees which are paid only once; direct charges for use
of club facilities which includes charges for food and beverage; athletic or
sporting rental fees; lodging and valet charges; membership dues and
assessments paid as a condition of continued membership; fees paid by members
to club professionals for lessons (whether or not accounted for to the club.)</p>
<h4> </h4>

<h3>12a03 - Fraternal orders.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Like social or recreational clubs,
the activities of a national fraternal order and its local lodges usually do
not fall within the nonprofit educational, religious, or charitable activities
set forth in IB 779.214. Generally, such orders are considered to be operated for
a “business purpose” within the meaning of Sec 3(r). The ADV of a fraternal
order includes gross receipts from membership fees and any insurance business
or other commercial-type ventures since such sums are generated for a “business
purpose”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
However, for purposes of
determining enterprise coverage, a national fraternal order and its local
lodges constitute a single enterprise under the Act only if the activities are
performed through unified operations or common control for a common business
purpose. Where a local lodge operates as a service and/or social club and the
national order has little or no control over its day-to-day operations and also
has no interaction with the local lodge regarding activities such as insurance
programs or other business ventures, there would be no single enterprise. In
such cases, each lodge must be tested separately for purposes of determining
enterprise coverage</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12a04 - Golf facilities at country clubs operated by professionals.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Where the golf facilities operated
by a professional at a country club are held out as a place where goods and
services can be obtained to meet more completely and conveniently the needs and
desires of the club’s members it expects to service, It would be unrealistic to
regard the activities of such facilities as functionally separated from those
of the country club as a whole, for purposes of enterprise coverage. Rather,
the relationship of the business activities in providing goods and services to
the club’s members is functionally close and immediately connected with a
single business purpose common to the golf facilities and the country club. The
Act’s definition of “enterprise” contemplates that the activities of “one or
more corporate or other organizational units” may be joined in a single enterprise
meeting the statutory tests. The effect of the agreement between the country
club and the golf professional is to bring about the performance through
unified operations of the activities described so that they serve a common
business purpose, thus reflecting a situation much like that of companies
operating leased departments in stores, which clearly are contemplated by the
Act as included in the store enterprise. Therefore, Wage-Hour would consider
that the activities so joined form a single enterprise as defined in Sec 3(r)
of the Act. (See also FOH 12a02(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
These golf professionals are not
considered independent contractors of the kind referred to in Sec 3(r) as
performing related activities for the enterprise, as distinguished from these
performing such activities as participants in the enterprise. The term
“independent contractor” as used in Sec 3(r) for the purpose of exclusion from
the term “enterprise” has reference to an independent business which performs
services for other businesses as an established part of its own business
operations, and which deals in the ordinary course of its own operations with
the enterprise for which it performs services. The exclusion does not extend to
the performance of any related activities which, in economic reality, are
integral parts of the operation of the enterprise and actually performed
through unified operation or under common control with its other related
activities for its common business purpose. Not only are such activities not
excluded from the enterprise, but the employees of the golf professional would
be covered under enterprise coverage to the same extent as other employees of
the country club.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12a05 - Franchise agreements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
IB 779.226 - 778.232 discuss
franchise agreements. The following agreement, involving an employment agency,
is a further example of a situation where a single enterprise was found to
exist:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  the agreement includes an announcement of the
intention to form a national chain of such businesses as are conducted by the
franchisor and by means of the same trade name, forms, training manuals and
distinguishing characteristics (as established by the franchisor) to present a
united front and to secure public good will and encourage the use of the
franchisor’s service on a national basis;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  the franchisee is bound to observe strictly the rules
of operation established by the franchisor (who is free to change them at
anytime) and to file quarterly a statement of operation and whatever other
reports the franchisor may require;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  the franchisor prescribes, by means of a uniform form,
the contract which the franchisee shall make with his employees and his clients
and the fee to be charged the latter. Advertising presents the franchisor and
franchisee as one to the public. Franchisee is barred by the a franchise
agreement from entering into the same business for himself or with other firms
providing the service for three years and his employees for six months after
their service ends;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  in addition to the fee paid for the franchise, a uniform
percentage of gross receipts is remitted monthly to the franchisor who has
access at all times to the books, papers, and records;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  the franchisor has power to enforce the arrangements
for its participation and supervision through its right to terminate the
franchise if any term of agreement is violated. In the event of a sale of the
controlling interest, the franchisor receives a percentage of the sale price to
defray costs in training and assistance for the new management;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  all job orders with a starting salary of $500 or more
per month must be sent by the franchisee to the franchisor who processes them
and distributes them to all franchise offices. If another office succeeds in
placing an applicant in the job the fee is split 50-50 between the two franchisee
offices;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  the franchisor furnishes roving managers and trouble
shooters where needed. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12a06 - Banking
enterprises.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   In most cases, an enterprise engaged in banking is
limited by law to activities which are related to banking and to purposes of a
bank. This does not mean, however, that the only activities within a banking
enterprise are those which constitute banking in its most narrow sense.
Included in the enterprise of a bank, for example, where conducted under
unified operation or common control for a common business purpose, would be
those real estate operations incidental to a bank’s lending money and providing
housing for the conduct of its business. Thus, the operation of the bank
building or other buildings acquired as an incident to its banking operation,
even though such buildings are occupied by tenants other than the bank, would
be within the banking enterprise. The operation by the bank itself or a
subsidiary corporation of a parking lot or garage in conjunction with such a
building for the purpose of providing parking accommodations for customers of
the bank and the building tenants would likewise be included.  (See IB
779.206(b).)</p>

<h3>12b00 - Statutory
provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Sec 3(s) of the Act as amended in
1974 defines the term “enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of
goods for commerce” as “an enterprise which has employees engaged in commerce
or in the production of goods for commerce, or employees handling, selling, or
otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for
commerce by any person . . . .“ The Act further specifies that: “Any
establishment which has as its only regular employees the owner thereof or the
parent, spouse, child or other member of the immediate family of such owner
shall not be considered to be an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the
production of goods for commerce or a part of such an enterprise, and the sales
of such establishment shall not be included for the purpose of determining the
annual gross volume of sales of any enterprise for the purpose of this
subsection.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
Pending issuance of a revised
coverage bulletin, Secs 779.240 through 779.243 continues as valid
interpretations of the phrase in Sec 3(s): “or employees handling, selling, or
otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for
commerce by any person....”  The reference in Sec 3(s) as amended in 1974 to
enterprises having “employees engaged in commerce or in the production of goods
for commerce”, as in the case of the prior reference in the Act as amended in
1961 to enterprises in the activities of which “employees are so engaged”,
simply means that the employment of employees individually covered in the
traditional sense will also constitute a basis for determining that the
enterprise itself is engaged in “commerce or the production of goods for
commerce”. The usual tests for such individual coverage apply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
The language of Sec 3(s) of the
1966 Amendments--”. . . including employees handling, selling, or otherwise
working on goods . . .“--was changed in the 1974 Amendments to “. . . or
employees handling, selling or otherwise working on goods or materials ... .“
By changing the word “including” to “or”, Congress indicated its intention to
reflect more clearly that this is an additional basis of coverage. The 1974
Amendments also added the words “or materials” to make clear the Congressional
intent to include within this additional basis of coverage the handling of
goods consumed in the employer’s business, e.g., the soap used by a laundry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)          
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The 1977 amendments established a new Sec 3(s)(2) for
coverage of enterprises comprised exclusively of one or more retail or service
establishments and whose AGV of sales or business done (exclusive of the usual
excise taxes) is not less than:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$275,000 effective 7/1/78</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$325,000 effective 7/1/80</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$362,500 effective 1/1/82</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Sec 3(s) was further amended in 1977 to require that
those retail or service enterprises which were subject to Sec 6(a)(1) on June
30. 1978, and which were removed from coverage under Sec 3(s)(2) because the
AGV is less than the sales volume tests, must (if the AGV does not fall below
$250,00) pay its employees not less than the MW in effect on the day before
coverage was lost. Such newly uncovered retail or service enterprises are
required to pay OT.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12b01 - Enterprise
employee test.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
In order for all employees of an
enterprise to be covered on an enterprise basis under amended Sec 3(s), at
least some of the employees employed in the activities which constitute the
enterprise must be engaged in commerce or in producing goods for commerce, or
handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been
moved in or produced for commerce by any person. Thus, where the enterprise has
some employees so engaged, it is not necessary that two or more employees in
each establishment be individually covered. The requirement is that the
enterprise have some employees who are individually covered or engaged in
handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been
moved in or produced for commerce by any person. Although two or more employees
so engaged may be sufficient to satisfy this requirement, it is important to
establish, if possible, that the number of such employees is substantial or
that it represents a significant portion of the employees in the enterprise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
It is not necessary that the enterprise
have two or more employees engaged in the named activities every week since
this test as with other requirements for enterprise coverage under Sec 3(s) is
applied on an annual basis. Thus, this requirement will be met if such
employees are engaged in the named activities on a regular and recurrent basis.
The requirement will not be met, however, where the enterprise has employees
engaged only in an insubstantial amount of the named activities on isolated or
sporadic occasions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
It is not necessary that the
employees engaged in the activities described in Sec 3(s) be nonexempt. Thus,
for example, the test will be met where one or more of the employees is exempt
from Sec 6 or 7 so long as they are engaged in the named activities. Likewise,
so long as the enterprise “has” such employees employed in its activities, it
is not necessary that such employees perform their duties in an establishment
of the enterprise.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12b02 - Application of
amended Sec 3(s) to mixed or hybrid enterprises.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
A single enterprise within the
meaning of Sec 3(r) may in some cases be engaged in various activities which,
although related and for a common business purpose, so differ in character and
function as to constitute a mixed or hybrid enterprise and thus involve the
possible application of more than one of the tests under Sec 3(s). For example,
a manufacturing enterprise may also engage in construction. In such situations,
the application of the test of Sec 3(s) shall be made as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  If the hybrid enterprise consists only of a
combination of activities which are named in Secs 3(s)(3) through (5) as
activities of the enterprise therein described (with respect to which there is
no ADV test), all employees employed in the hybrid enterprise shall be considered
covered on an enterprise basis under Sec 3(s).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  If the hybrid enterprise consists of some combination
of activities named as those in which enterprises covered under Secs 3(s)(3)
through (5) are engaged, together with other activities not so named, the employees
employed in the hybrid enterprise shall be considered covered on an enterprise
basis under Sec 3(s), if the ADV test of Sec 3(s)(1) is met by the hybrid
enterprise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  In the case of any hybrid enterprise consisting of a
combination of activities named as those in which enterprises covered under
Secs 3(s)(3) through 3(s)(5) are engaged, together with other activities not so
named, whose ADV is less then $250,000 exclusive of the specified taxes, the
facts shall be developed and the matter submitted to the RS for opinion with
respect to coverage of the employees employed in the enterprise in activities
not named in Secs 3(s)(3) through 3(s)(5) as activities of the enterprises
covered thereby. In any such case, however, enterprise coverage extends at least
to those employees employed in the hybrid enterprise in activities named in
Secs 3(s)(3) through (5) as activities of the enterprises therein described</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12b03 - Goods or materials
under Sec 3(s).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees will be considered to be handling, selling or otherwise
working on “goods or materials” that have been moved in or produced for
commerce by any person within the meaning of Sec 3(s), if what they are
handling, selling, or working on constitutes “goods or materials” which have
been so moved or produced. “Goods” are defined in Sec 3(i) of the Act. The fact
that the interstate movement of the goods or materials handled or worked on by
the employees does not begin until after, or has ended before, their work is
performed can provide no basis for concluding that their activities do not
relate to “goods or materials” within the meaning of Sec 3(s). Congress has
specifically recognized that demand for a product affects interstate inflow of
“goods or materials” quite as surely as production for commerce affects
outflow. Thus the language “goods or materials”, as used in Sec 3(s), includes
trucks, equipment, replacement parts, supplies, stock-in-trade, finished or raw
materials and other “goods or materials” that have been moved in or produced
for commerce.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12b04 - Excise taxes.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
(See IB 779.261 thru IB 779.264.)
The extent to which State excise taxes on tobacco are levied at the retail
level depends upon the law of the particular State. In cases where enterprise
coverage hinges on the question of State excise taxes on tobacco, all the facts
regarding such taxes shall be submitted through channels to the RS for an
opinion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
The price of auto license plates
does not represent a separately stated tax imposed at the retail level for the
use of highways. Thus, no part of the sale price of auto license plates can
qualify as excise taxes levied “at the retail level”.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12b05 - “Sales for
purposes of Sec 3(s) AGV test.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
The definition of a “sale” in Sec
3(k) and the discussion in IB 779.259 of income which is included in the AGV of
sales for purposes of Secs 3(s)(1) and 3(s)(2) will in most cases provide
sufficient guidance to determine whether the AGV tests of Sec 3(s) are met. In
some cases, however, it may not be possible to determine on the basis of
current interpretative material whether certain income or transactions are
considered as “sales” (or “business”) for purposes of Sec 3(s). In such cases,
and where enterprise coverage hinges on the question, all the facts regarding
such income and transactions shall be submitted through channels to the RS for
an opinion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
The interpretations set forth
below are specific determinations regarding certain “sales” (or “business”) of
particular establishments and industries. When referring to these
determinations it must be kept in mind that the listings do not include all
“sales” of the named establishments and industries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Insurance companies.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The total premium income received from all policies in a given year
constitute “sales” and are included in that year’s AGV of sales without regard
to the year in which the policy was originally sold.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Banks and financial institutions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Interest from loans and stock dividends are included in the AGV of
sales.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Automobile license bureaus or tag agencies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The gross price of auto license plates sold by privately operated auto
tag agencies or license bureaus is included in the ADV. (See also FOH 12b04(b)
and FOH 21ca07.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Real estate. financial, and property management firms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The total rental receipts received by real estate, financial, and
property management firms from buildings which they own are included in the AGV
of sales for purposes of Sec 3(s)(1). With respect to properties which such
firms manage but do not own, only the gross fee or gross commission received
for services rendered would be included in the AGV of sales. In connection with
other related activities, such as the sale of property and property insurance,
the annual sales volume is measured by gross receipts and not by commission
payments.</p>

<h3>12c00 - Statutory
provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 3(s)(1) of the Act brings within coverage any employee employed in
an enterprise whose AGV of sales made or business done is not less than
$250,000 (exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level which are separately
stated).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12c01 - Excise taxes.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>For purposes of Secs 3(s)(1) and 3(s)(2), excise taxes, if any, levied
by United States, State, or local governments will be excluded in computing the
ADV of sales made or business done provided they are levied at the retail level
and separately stated. (See IB 779.261-779.264, and FOH 12b04.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12c02 - “Business done”
defined.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
The 1966 Amendments added the
phrase “or business done” to the term “annual gross volume of sales made” in
Sec 3(s)(1) to reflect more clearly the economic test of business size
previously expressed in the Act in terms of “annual gross volume of sales”. It
is intended by this test to measure the size of an enterprise for purposes of
enterprise coverage in terms of the ADV in dollars (exclusive of specified
taxes) of the business transactions of the enterprise, regardless of whether such
transactions are “sales” in a technical sense. Based on language contained in
the Congressional Reports, the measure is intended to be applied to business
transactions with the customers of the enterprise, or with the persons who
purchase property or services of any kind through transactions with the
enterprise, in terms of the gross price they pay for whatever they obtain as a
result of the transaction; no intent appears to measure “business done” by
adding to such amounts the sums paid out by the enterprise as business
expenses. For example, gross dollar volume from “business done” will include
the gross amounts paid by the tenants or users as consideration for the leasing
or rental of property to them by the enterprise. On the other hand,
expenditures made by the enterprise such as rental payments, mortgage payments,
interest payments on loans, and accounts payable will be excluded in computing
gross volume of sales made and business done.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
In applying Sec 3(s)(1), the ADV
of an enterprise is deemed to include the gross volume of the “sales” which it
makes, as defined in Sec 3(k) of the Act (see IB 779.259), and/or the gross
volume of its “business done” as explained in (a) above; that is, the gross
dollar volume of any other business activity in which the enterprise engaged
which can similarly be measured on a dollar basis.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12c03 - Architectural and
consulting engineering firms.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Independent architectural or consulting engineering firms which provide
such architectural and engineering services to others as consulting and
designing, developing plans and specifications, surveying in the field, and
providing personnel at construction job sites to see that the work is carried
out in accordance with the plans and specifications are considered to be
engaged in the business of providing such services rather than in “the business
of construction or reconstruction, or both” within the meaning of Sec 3(s)(3).
Thus, such firms are tested for purposes of enterprise coverage under Sec
3(s)(1).</p>

<h3>12d00 - Statutory
provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
The 1977 Amendments amended Sec
3(s) effective January 1, 1978, to include a new Sec 3(s)(2). Sec 3(s)(1) was
amended by adding the following after “and begin February 1, 1969, is an
enterprise”:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“, other than an enterprise which is comprised exclusively of retail or
service establishments and which is described in paragraph (2),”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 3(s)(2) now reads:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“is an enterprise which is comprised exclusively of one or more retail
or service establishments, as defined in section 13(a)(2), and whose annual
gross volume of sales made or business done is not less that $250,000
(exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level which are separately stated),
beginning July 1, 1978, whose annual gross volume of sales made or business
done is not less than $275,000 (exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level
which are separately stated), beginning July 1, 1980, whose annual gross volume
of sales made or business done is not less than $325,000 (exclusive of excise
taxes at the retail level which are separately stated), and after December 31,
1981, whose annual gross volume of sales made or business done is not less than
$362,500 (exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level which are separately
stated);”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
Sec 3(s) was further amended by
adding the following “grandfather clause” to the end of the section.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Notwithstanding paragraph (2), an enterprise which is comprised of one
or more retail or service establishments, which on June 30, 1978, was subject
to section 6(a)(1), and which because of a change in the dollar volume standard
in such paragraph prescribed by the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1977 is
not subject to such section, shall, if its annual gross volume of sales made or
business done is not less than $250,000 (exclusive of excise taxes at the
retail level which are separately stated), pay its employees not less than the
minimum wage in effect under such section on the day before such change takes
effect and shall pay its employees in accordance with section 7.  A violation
of the preceding sentence shall be considered a violation of section 6 or 7 as
the case may be.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
The Amendments of 1977 made a
number of changes in the FLSA which concern enterprises comprised exclusively
of one or more retail or service establishments. These amendments:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Changed the ADV test for coverage under new Sec
3(s)(2);</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Increased the MW;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Increased the monthly dollar test for tipped employees
under Sec 3(t); and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Decreased the tip credit under Sec 3(m) of the Act.</p>

<h3>12d01 - Effect of changes in the ADV on Sec 3(s)(2) enterprises.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Enterprises not 3(s)(2) covered on
6/30/78:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Some effects of changes in the ADV under Sec 3(s)(2) on coverage of
retail or service enterprises are illustrated below. See also FOH 21a01.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  A new retail or service enterprise beginning business
after 6/30/78 is not covered until its ADV reaches the applicable statutory
amount contained in Sec 3(s)(2) ($362,500 effective 1/1/82).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  If such an enterprise had an ADV of less than $250,000
on 6/30/78, it was not a covered Sec 3(s)(2) enterprise. This lack of coverage
under Sec 3(s)(2) continues if the enterprise never attains an ADV which would
cover it under Sec 3(s)(2) ($362,500 since 1/1/82).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  However, if such an enterprise’s ADV increases so that
it equals or exceeds the $362,500 ADV test currently in effect, the enterprise
must begin paying MW and OT at the time coverage becomes applicable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  If the ADV later falls below $362,500, the enterprise
would not be covered and would remain so until the ADV again increases to the
$362,500 level at which time the enterprise would again be covered under Sec
3(s)(2)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
Enterprises 3(s)(2) covered on
6/30/78:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some effects of changes in the ADV of a Sec 3(s)(2) enterprise which is
“grandfathered” under Sec 3(s) are illustrated below:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Enterprise coverage under the grandfather clause at
the end of Sec 3(s) cannot be asserted unless the enterprise was covered on
6/30/78. The language of Sec 3(s) expressly requires that in order to be
grandfathered an enterprise must have been covered on 6/30/78.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  By way of illustration, if, during the period 7/1/78
to 6/30/80, a retail enterprise had an ADV of at least $275,000, and its ADV
subsequently falls below $275,000 (but remains at least $250,000), the MW
effective for that enterprise reverts to $2.65 an hour (the MW in effect on the
day before the statutory ADV increased to $275,000). This MW remains in effect
for the enterprise until its ADV falls below $250,000, or until its ADV once
again reaches a statutory ADV level which requires payment of a higher MW. This
is illustrated below:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>(3)  To further illustrate, if the ADV of a retail or
service enterprise (which was covered on 6/30/78) was $300,000 on 7/1/80, and
the enterprise became noncovered because of the increase in the statutory
standard on that date ($325,000), it would be required to continue to pay an MW
of 3.10 per hour until such time as the ADV of the enterprise met a later
statutory level ($325,000 from 7/1/80 to 12/31/81; $362,500 after 12/31/81). At
such time as the ADV of the enterprise reached the later statutory level, it would
be required to pay the MW in effect at that time ($3.35 per hour since
12/31/80).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once its ADV has risen to a later statutory level, the enterprise would
be required to continue to pay the applicable MW until such time as its ADV
falls below that level. Thereafter, it would be required to pay (1) whatever MW
was applicable “on the day before the statutory change took effect,” and (2)
proper OT. For example, if an enterprise having an ADV of $362,500 fell to an
ADV of $300,000, its applicable MW would become $3.10 an hour, which was the
statutory MW in effect on 6/30/80, the day before the statutory ADV level rose
to $325,000.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If on the other hand, the ADV of the enterprise falls below $250,000,
it would cease to be covered until such time as its ADV rose to at least the
current level of $362,500.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
Certain special problems which
have arisen from the application of the grandfather clause are as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  A hotel or motel enterprise which is grandfathered
under Sec 3(s)(2) cannot pay OT based on the old partial OT exemption formerly
contained in Sec 13(b)(8) notwithstanding the fact that Sec 13(b)(8) was in
effect at the time the enterprise was grandfathered. Sec 3(s) states that a
retail or service enterprise which is grandfathered shall pay its employees in
accordance with Sec 7. There is no implication that any exemptions which were
repealed are to apply currently to grandfathered enterprises because the
exemption may have been applicable on 6/30/78, or thereafter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Retail or service enterprises which are grandfathered
under Sec 3(s)(2) cannot take a tip credit higher than that currently in effect
(40%).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that the higher
tip credits which were available to employers prior to 1/1/79 or 1/1/80 are currently
to be made available to grandfathered enterprises.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, if $3.10 continues to be the MW applicable to a
grandfathered enterprise, the employer would be entitled to a tip credit not to
exceed 40% of $3.10, that is, $1.24 per hour. (Sec 3(m), as amended, effective
1/1/80.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12d02 - Application of CL
to retail and service enterprises under amended Sec 3(s).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>For purpose of CL, enterprise coverage will continue to be asserted
with respect to employees of retail and service enterprises which have MW
obligations as a result of the grandfather clause, but which no longer meet the
higher dollar tests of Sec 3(s)(2). Although Sec 3(s) does not expressly
provide for the retention of enterprise coverage with regard to CL for
previously covered Sec 3(s)(2) enterprises, there is no evidence that Congress
intended such coverage to be eliminated.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12d03 - Gasoline service
station enterprises under Sec 3(s)(2).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A gasoline service station enterprise comprised exclusively of one or
more retail or service establishments is subject to Sec 3(s)(2) coverage and
must be tested for ADV as any other retail or service enterprise (see FOH
12d01).</p>

<h3>12e00  - Statutory
provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Sec 3(s)(3) of the Act brings
within coverage employees employed in an enterprise which “is engaged in
laundering, cleaning, or repairing clothing or fabrics”. (There is no ADV test
for such enterprises.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
Since enterprise coverage as
defined in Sec 3(s) of the Act includes “employees handling, selling, or
otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for
commerce by any person”, the requirement that some employees in the enterprise
engage in the named activities will be satisfied, for example, where some
employees in the enterprise handle or work with supplies received from outside
the State such as bleaches, soaps, or packaging materials such as cartons and
wrapping paper.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12e01 - Establishment
whose activities are included in Sec 3(s)(3) enterprises.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>For purposes of Sec 3(s)(3) the activities performed in or by the
following establishments are considered to be included in an enterprise which
is engaged in laundering, cleaning, or repairing clothing or fabrics:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Central laundry or dry cleaning establishments;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Laundry or dry cleaning establishments (generally
known in the trade as “valet shops” or “will-call” or “pickup and delivery”
stations) which receive from and return to their customers clothing or fabrics
for laundering, cleaning, or repairing at a central laundry or dry cleaning
establishment;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Coin-operated laundries (laundromats); and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Self-service cleaners.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In such cases the possibility of a family owned and operated
establishment should not be overlooked (see FOH 12b00).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12e02  - Shoe repair
shops.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The activities performed by a shoe repair establishment are not
considered to constitute engagement in “laundering, cleaning, or repairing
clothing or fabrics” for purposes of Sec 3(s)(3).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12e03 - Laundry operations
by hotels. motels, or restaurants.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Employees of a hotel, motel, or
restaurant engaged in performing laundering, cleaning, or repairing of clothing
or fabrics will be covered on an enterprise basis under Sec 3(s)(3) if there
are in the hotel, motel, or restaurant enterprise employees “engaged in
commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, including employees
handling ... by any person”. However, a Sec 13(a)(2) exemption may still apply
to other employees of the hotel, motel, or restaurant who are not engaged in
such laundry operations if the test of that exemption are met. (See FOH
21cL01.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
Generally, enterprise coverage
under Sec 3(s)(3) applies to employees of a hotel, motel, or restaurant who
regularly and recurringly perform laundering, cleaning, or repairing of
clothing or fabrics in the laundry or drycleaning portion of the establishment.
Thus, for example, employees who regularly and recurringly perform the actual
laundering work or who work in a pickup station or in a coin-operated laundry
operated by the hotel will be considered as engaged in laundering for purposes
of Sec 3(s)(3). On the other hand, a bellhop who merely picks up and returns
clothing to be laundered or dry-cleaned or a maid who merely handles linens
incident to the making or unmaking of beds would not be considered as so
engaged.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12e04 - Diaper services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The activities of the typical diaper service, i.e., the rental of
laundered baby diapers, is considered the laundering of fabrics for purpose of
Sec 3(s)(3). Its operation is no different from that of a laundry which
specializes in renting laundered uniforms, towels, and linens.</p>

<h3>12f00 - Statutory
provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 3(s)(4) brings within the general coverage of the Act employees
employed in an enterprise which “is engaged in the business of construction or
reconstruction or both”.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12f01 - Painting,
sandblasting, and tuckpointing.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Painting, sandblasting, and tuckpointing are part of the construction
industry and are clearly a construction or reconstruction activity where
performed as an integral part of a definite construction or reconstruction job,
such as the renovation, remodeling, rehabilitation, or reconstruction of
existing structures or the construction of new structures. In addition,
contract painting, even though part of the ordinary maintenance of an existing
structure, is generally regarded as a part of the construction industry when
performed by an employer engaged in the business of painting, and would be
considered “construction or reconstruction” for purposes of Sec 3(s)(4).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12f02 - Installation as a
construction activity.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Certain business such as
establishments engaged in the sale of plumbing and heating equipment,
electrical fixtures and supplies, irrigation equipment, and fencing and siding,
in addition to selling goods, also install the goods which are sold. In
determining whether such installation constitutes engagement in “construction
or reconstruction” for purposes of Sec 3(s)(4), it is necessary to consider the
general characteristics of the entire transaction. At least in situations where
one or more of the following conditions are present the installation will normally
be considered as engagement in construction or reconstruction:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The cost of installation is substantial in relation to
the sale of the goods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The installation involves substantial structural
changes, extensive labor, planning, or the use of specialized equipment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The goods are being installed in conjunction with the
construction, renovation, remodeling, or reconstruction of a home or other
structure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The goods installed are of a specialized type which
the general consuming public does not ordinarily have occasion to use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
By way of example of the
principles involved, if the installation requires only minor carpentry,
plumbing, or electrical work (as may be the case where ordinary plumbing
fixtures, or household items such as stoves, garbage disposals, attic fans, or
window air conditioners are being installed or replaced), or where only labor
of the type required for the usual installation of chain link fences around a
home or small business establishment is involved, in the absence of any of the
criteria listed in (a) above, such installation will not normally be considered
as “construction or reconstruction”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
In determining the cost of
installation in relation to the sale price of the goods pursuant to subsec
(a)(1) above and IB 779.321, the difference between the total price paid by the
purchaser for the installed job and the price charged him for the materials
used is the cost (to the purchaser) of installation.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12f03 – Roofing, guttering,
and spouting.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The installation, repair, or replacement of roofing, guttering, and
spouting in conjunction with new or existing buildings are considered
construction or reconstruction activities within the meaning of Sec 3(s)(4).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12f04 - Water well
drilling.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The drilling of water wells is a construction activity within the
meaning of Sec 3(s)(4).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12f05 - Installation of
draperies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The installation of draperies in new buildings is not considered a
construction activity for purposes of Sec 3(s)(4).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12f06 - Landscaping as a
construction activity.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In some sales agreements between builders and individual home buyers,
the buyer contracts for a package arrangement whereby the completed home
includes the landscaping. In those cases where the general builder by contract
or agreement subcontracts the landscaping, the subcontractor is contributing
toward the actual construction of the completed home as contemplated by the
sales agreement. In such situations the activities of the landscaper, including
the planting of nursery products, the grading and seeding of lawns, and
construction of retaining walls, are closely identified with building the homes
and are considered to be “construction” for purposes of applying Sec 3(s)(4). </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12f07 - Floor covering
firms.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
The installation of hardwood
floors, wall tile, and floor tile is “construction or reconstruction” for
purposes of Sec 3(s)(4) whether performed in conjunction with original
construction or as a part of a remodeling or repair operation. Additionally,
contracts for relaying or refinishing floors on “insurance jobs” (such as
repair work due to fire or water damage) would be contracts for “reconstruction”
in the ordinary case.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
Where such a firm lays carpeting
or linoleum (as a contractor or subcontractor) as part of the construction or
reconstruction of a building, the activities may properly be classified as
“construction or reconstruction”. However, the laying of carpeting or linoleum
in existing premises may not be considered “construction or reconstruction”
when done merely to meet a customer’s request for covering or renewing a floor
since the actual construction work involved in such an operation is normally de
minimis.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12f08 - Architectural and
consulting engineering firms.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Separate and independent architectural and consulting engineering firms
are tested for enterprise coverage under Sec 3(s)(4) only where their own
operations, as distinguished from those of other enterprises engaged directly
in construction to which their services related, constitute engagement in “the
business of construction or reconstruction, or both”.</p>

<h3>12g00  - Statutory
provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Sec 3(s)(5) brings within the
coverage of the Act employees employed in an enterprise which “is engaged in
the operation of a hospital, an institution primarily engaged in the care of
the sick, the aged, the mentally ill or defective who reside on the premises of
such institution, a school for mentally or physically handicapped or gifted
children, an elementary or secondary school, or an institution of higher
education (regardless of whether or not such hospital, institution, or school
is public or private or operated for profit or not for profit)”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
Effective 7/1/72, the Education
Amendments of 1972 amended Sec 3(s)(5) to include preschools within the
coverage of the Act. Sec 3(s)(5) as amended reads as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“(5) is engaged in the operation of a hospital, an institution
primarily engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, the mentally ill or
defective who reside on the premises of such institution, a school for mentally
or physically handicapped or gifted children, a preschool, elementary or
secondary school or an institution of higher education (regardless of whether
or not such hospital, institution, or school is public or private or operated
for profit or not for profit), or”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Prior to 7/1/72, employees of preschools were not covered under Sec
3(s)(5).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
On June 24, 1976, the Supreme
Court in the case of National League of Cities. et al. v. Usery held that the
MW and OT provisions of the FLSA do not apply to State and local government
employees engaged in activities which are an integral part of traditional
government services. (See FOH 59d.) The Court expressly found that the
following activities were among those to which these provisions do not apply:
“schools, hospitals, fire prevention, police protection, sanitation, public
health, parks and recreation”. Additionally, there are certain activities
clearly reserved for State and local governments which DOL will regard as no
longer subject to MW and OT (e.g., the Courts, Legislatures and other governing
bodies, tax assessor’s office). The Court’s decision does not discuss
activities which might be regarded as “nontraditional” such as State liquor stores,
and utility and transit services. The majority opinion does state that the MW
and OT provisions could apply to a State’s operation of a railroad. Questions
which cannot be resolved because of uncertainty as to whether the function is
“traditional”, should be developed and referred to the RS for an opinion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)          
The Court’s decision deals only
with the MW and OT provisions of the FLSA. It is our position that the decision
does not affect the application of the EP and CL provisions of the FLSA or of
the ADEA to employees of State and local governments, and that the provisions
continue to apply.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g01 - Hospital defined.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
The FLSA does not define a
hospital. However, the term “hospital” refers to those establishments commonly
known as “hospitals” which primarily engaged in the offering of medical and
surgical services to patients who generally remain at the establishments either
overnight, several days, or for extended periods. Clinics and dispensaries are
not included within the term “hospital” unless operated by a hospital in the
hospital establishment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
Based on considerations of the
standards and findings of other agencies and authoritative sources it is the
position of WH that any establishment described in (a) above which meets any of
the following three tests should be recognized as a hospital for purposes of
the FLSA:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Any establishment recognized by the U.S. department of
Health, Education, and Welfare as a hospital for Medicare.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Any establishment accredited by the Joint Commission
on Accreditation of Hospitals. This Commission is located in Chicago, Ill., and
is composed of representatives from the American Medical Assn., the American
Hospital Assn., the American College of Physicians and the American College of
Surgeons. Its function is to establish standards for hospital operations and to
insure continued adherence to these standards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Any establishment which—</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     Is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the
supervision of physicians,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
Diagnostic services and
therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured,
disabled, or sick persons, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
Rehabilitation services for the
rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     Is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the
supervision of a physician, psychiatric services for the diagnosis and
treatment of mentally ill persons; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     Is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the
supervision of a physician, medical services for the diagnosis and treatment of
tuberculosis;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
d.     And, in addition to meeting one of the above
requirements, also satisfies the following requirements:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
Maintains clinical records on all
patients; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
Has bylaws in effect with respect
to its staff of physicians; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
Has a requirement that every
patient must be under the care of a physician; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.    
Provides 24-hour nursing service
rendered or supervised by a registered professional nurse, and has a licensed
practical nurse or registered professional nurse on duty at all times; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5.    
In the case of an institution in
any State in which State or applicable local law provides for the licensing of
hospitals,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A.  
Is licensed pursuant to such law,
or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>B.   
Is approved, by the agency of such
State or locality responsible for licensing hospitals, as meeting the standards
established for such licensing.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g02  - Institutions primarily engaged in the care of the sick. the aged,
the mentally ill or defective residing on the premises defined.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Such an institution (other than a hospital) is an institution primarily
engaged in (i.e., more that 50% of the income is attributable to) providing
domiciliary care to individuals who reside on the premises and who, if
suffering from physical or mental infirmity or sickness of any kind, will
require only general treatment or observation of a less critical nature than that
provided by a hospital. Such institutions are not limited to nursing homes,
whether licensed or not licensed, but include those institutions generally
known as nursing homes, rest homes, convalescent homes, homes for the elderly
and infirm, and the like. (See also FOH 25i and 12g12.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g03 - Preschools
defined.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Effective 7/1172, a preschool is any enterprise (as defined in Secs
3(r) and 3(s) of the Act) which provides for the care and protection of infants
or preschool children outside their own homes during any portion of a 24-hour
day. The term “preschool” includes any establishment or institution which
accepts for enrollment children of preschool age for purposes of providing
custodial, educational, or development services designed to prepare the children
for school in the years before they enter the elementary school grades. This
includes day care centers, nursery schools, kindergartens. Head Start programs
and any similar facility primarily engaged in the care and protection of
preschool children.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g04  - Elementary school
defined.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>FLSA Sec 3(v) defines such a school as “a day or residential school
which provides elementary education, as determined under State law”.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g05  - Secondary school
defined.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>FLSA Sec 3(w) defines such a school as “a day or residential school
which provides secondary education, as determined under State law”.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g06  - Veterinary
hospitals.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The word “hospital”, as used in the Act, refers to an institution (see
FOH 12f01) for the care of sick, wounded, infirm, or aged persons. A veterinary
hospital for the care of animals is not considered to be a hospital within the
meaning of Sec 3(s)(5). Consequently, employees of a veterinary hospital will
be covered on an enterprise basis only if the veterinary hospital meets the
tests of Sec 3(s)(1) or 3(s)(2), whichever is applicable (see FOH 21a01(d)).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g07  - Head Start
programs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of Head Start programs are covered under Sec 3(s)(5).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g08  - University and
college employee - coverage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
The “enterprise” operating a
private institution of higher education normally consists of that institution’s
administrative and academic offices, custodial and maintenance functions and
facilities, physical plant and real estate. Many universities occupy more than
one campus and many others have a number of separate schools or departments in
separate geographical units. All the constituent elements relating to one or
more campuses, schools or departments, the operation of which is related and
performed through unified operations or common control for a common business
purpose would be considered a single enterprise for purpose of Secs 3(r) and
3(s)(5). Insofar as the operation of schools and related institutions is
concerned, the term “common business” encompasses those activities, whether performed
by one or more persons, corporations, or other organizational units, which are
directed to the same objective or objectives in which the enterprise is
interested.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
Pending interpretations by the
courts, Wage-Hour will take no position as to the application of the Act to
housekeepers, food service employees, or cleaning personnel who work
exclusively in a faculty residence hall or, in the case of a parochial school,
in a convent where teaching sisters live.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g09  - University and
college fraternity and sorority house - coverage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Many universities and colleges
have on their campuses fraternity and sorority houses that provide dormitory
and dining hall facilities for students (members). In order to provide these
services such organizations may employ such personnel as house directors or
house mothers, cooks, maids, etc. These employees are generally paid from
revenues derived from the charges to members for items such as room, board, and
dues. in the ordinary case these organizations are controlled and operated by
the national and local chapter organization and the degree of supervision and
control by the educational establishment is likely to be quite casual and
nominal. As a general rule WH does not consider the operation of these
fraternity and sorority houses as a part of the college or university
enterprise within the meaning of Secs 3(r) and 3(s)(5).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
There may be instances where the
facts demonstrate that certain activities such as the provision of student
meals and lodging in the fraternity and sorority houses are part of the
university enterprise, as could be the case, for example, where the university
owns the houses or exercises a high degree of supervision and control. In such
doubtful situations, a careful study of the fraternity or sorority charter
provisions and the university rules applicable to such houses would be
essential in making a determination.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
While the general rule excludes
student meal and lodging activities in fraternity and sorority houses from
enterprises coverage under Sec3(s)(5), the possible application of Sec 3(s)(1)
to the fraternity or sorority enterprise should not be overlooked.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g10  - Barber colleges
and beauty schools.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Barber colleges and beauty schools are not considered to be
“institutions of higher education”’ for purposes of Sec 3(s)(5).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g11  - Institutions of
higher education.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Although the term “institutions of
higher education” contained in Secs 3(r)(1) and 3(s)(5) is not defined in the
FLSA, the ordinary meaning of the phrase is that they are institutions above
the secondary level, such as colleges or universities, junior colleges,
professional schools of engineering, law, library science, social work, etc.
Generally, an institution of higher education is an educational institution
which:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Admits as regular students only individuals having a
certificate of graduation from a high school or the recognized equivalent of
such a certificate; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Is legally authorized within a State to provide a
program of education beyond high school; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Provides an educational program for which it normally
awards a bachelor’s degree, or provides not less than a two-year program which
is acceptable for full credit toward such a degree, or offers a two-year
program in engineering, mathematics, or the physical or biological sciences
which is designed to prepare the student to work as a technician and at a
semiprofessional level in engineering, scientific, or other technological
fields which require the understanding and application of basic engineering,
scientific, or mathematical principles or knowledge.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g12 - Institutions for
the residential care of emotionally disturbed persons.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>For enforcement purposes, a private institution for the residential
care of emotionally disturbed persons would come within the coverage of Sec
3(s)(5) of the Act if more than 50% of its residents have been admitted by a
qualified physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist. For purposes of the 50%
test, the term “admitted” includes evaluations of mental or emotional
disturbance by a qualified physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist either
subsequent to admission to the institution or preceding admission and being the
cause for referral.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g13  - Driving schools.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Establishments engaged as a business in instructing and teaching motor
vehicle driving are not bona fide educational establishments or institutions
for purposes of Sec 3(s)(5) or Reg 541.215.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g14 - “Community living
centers” and “halfway houses” for retarded persons.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>For enforcement purposes, a private institution for mentally retarded
persons, sometimes called a “community living center” or a “halfway house”,
would come within the coverage of Sec 3(s)(5) of the Act, if more than 50% of
its residents have an IQ of 69 or less as determined on the basis of a valid
test administered by a qualified professional and a reasonable degree of “care”
is being provided. An IQ of 69 or below is considered “mentally defective”.
“Care” may include such services as waking up residents in the morning to see
that they get breakfast in time to leave for work, picking some up at night
after work, special counseling, instruction in money management and health
matters and generally keeping an eye on them and listening to problems. (See
also FOH 12g02 and 12g12.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g15 - “Care” of the aged
and infirm.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Many establishments variously
referred to as “retirement hotels”, “retirement apartments”, “homes for…”, “senior
citizens retirement homes” and the like provide residences and other services
for older persons. In order to determine whether such an establishment may
qualify as an “institution primarily engaged in the care of the … aged …”, one
of the key questions is whether “care” is provided.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)          
The word “care” as it is used in
Sec 3(s)(5) is subject to a broad interpretation and encompasses routine
custodial services and attention. Institutions which care for the aged, (as
well as other institutions which care for the sick, or for the mentally ill or
defective), can vary from extremely well-serviced establishments to those of a
custodial type of servicing. Where an establishment must take full
responsibility of any nursing home or hospital care a resident requires, this
constitutes “care” of the resident. However, it does not necessarily follow
that to be a home for the aged, the establishment must be a nursing home or
otherwise medically oriented. If the aged occupants, in addition to receiving
food, shelter, and laundry, must be closely watched because their senile
condition necessitates their being supervised and guided, even though they
receive no medical attention, they may, depending upon all the facts, be
receiving “care” for the aged within the meaning of Sec 3(s)(5). (See also FOH
12g02, 12g12, and 12g14.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
On the other hand, some apartment
hotels and retirement homes that cater to retirees and other elderly persons
who are completely ambulatory and in reasonably good health are not considered
institutions primarily engaged in the care of the aged who reside on the
premises. Even though such an establishment may furnish certain special
services, as for example, emergency pull bells in the bathroom connected to a
public address system in the office and a registered nurse on duty for an hour
each day to aid tenants if they need help in taking required medication, these
services may, depending upon all the facts, be just a part of a deluxe service
furnished by the establishment and such establishments would not be covered
under Sec 3(s)(5).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g16 - Day care
homes--family owned and operated.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Certain day care homes are not covered on an enterprise basis because
they are family owned and operated (see last sentence of Sec 3(s)). Typically a
mother who is already caring for her own children will care for other parents’
children in her residence without the aid of any regular employees other than
her immediate family. Such residences are distinct establishments for purposes
of the Act and are excluded from enterprise coverage by the last sentence of
Sec 3(s) notwithstanding that such homes may be in some way affiliated with a
covered enterprise.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g17 - Maternity homes
for unwed mothers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Private nonprofit institutions providing residential care for unwed
mothers are not covered by the enterprise provisions of the FLSA. provided that
the maternity home is not operated in conjunction with a hospital, covered
institution, or school within the meaning of Secs 3(r) and 3(s) of the Act.
There may be employees covered on an “individual” basis, however.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>12g18 - Institutions for
neglected and dependent children.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Private nonprofit institutions providing care for neglected and
dependent children are not covered by the enterprise provisions of the FLSA,
provided that such institution is not operated in conjunction with a hospital,
covered institution, or school within the meaning of Secs 3(r) and 3(s) of the
Act. However, there may be employees who are covered on an “individual” basis.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13a00 - General basis for coverage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Coverage under the PCA is explained in Part I of
R&amp;I No. 3.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  While it has not been authoritatively settled that
there is no coverage under the PCA if the PCA stipulations are not included in
the contract, either directly or by reference, coverage is not asserted for a
contractor who has no notice by stipulation or otherwise of the application of
the Act, and administrative enforcement action is not taken. If the invitation
to bid on a contract within the scope of the Act includes the stipulations
either directly or by reference, coverage would result since the invitation to
bid becomes a part of the contract.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The obligation of a contractor arises on the date when
notice of award is sent to him or her and not on the date the contract is
executed. The necessity of compliance with the representations and stipulations
of the Act is confined to the period in which the contractor is actually
engaged in the performance of work on the contract, including activities
immediately preparatory thereto, provided the records of the contractor
adequately disclose the period during which Government work is being performed.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13a01 - Coverage of
secondary contractors.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Secondary contractors are covered under the following
circumstances:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Where the secondary contractor substitutes for the
prime contractor in performing any of the work which the latter has contracted
to do for the Government, as by (a) manufacturing or furnishing any of the
contract items which the prime contractor has agreed to manufacture or furnish
for the Government, or by (b) producing or supplying any parts, materials, or
services to be used in manufacturing an end product that the prime contractor
has agreed to manufacture for the Government, which parts, materials, or
services it is the regular practice in the industry manufacturing such end
product for the manufacturers to produce or supply themselves rather than to
procure from others; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Where the secondary contractor is a manufacturer of
materials, supplies, articles, or equipment which the Government has contracted
with a regular dealer to furnish, and the dealer causes the manufacturer to
deliver the items directly to the Government either by a direct shipment to the
Government agency as consignee or to the prime contractor’s warehouse or other
designated place where they will be held for the Government and not placed in
regular stock; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Where the secondary contractor, pursuant to a contract
in excess of $10,000 in amount with a Government prime contractor, is engaged
in the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment
which the Government agency has contracted with the prime contractor to procure
for and on behalf of the Government from suppliers thereof, the cost of which
the Government has agreed to pay or reimburse from Government funds; or </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Where the secondary transports the end product called
for by a covered contract to the Government or where it performs any operation
on the end product, such as weatherproofing or painting; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     Where it is the regular practice for manufacturers of
the end product to perform the function assigned to the secondary. Under this
principle, depending on the regular practice in the industry, the Act may be applicable
to a secondary for the manufacture of parts to be incorporated in the end
product, tools and dies to be used in its manufacture, materials used in
packaging the end product, and production-related services, such as engineering
and drafting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     If coverage of a secondary turns on regular practice
in an industry, the RD will submit the question to the AA for OWDR for a
ruling, furnishing the following information:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
Name and address of primary
contractor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
Contract number and contracting
agency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
Product called for in prime
contract.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.    
Name and address of secondary
contractor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5.    
A description of the product
supplied or operation performed by the secondary contractor.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13a02 - Aircraft
manufacturers and assemblers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Regular practice
determinations have not been made in this industry. Accordingly, until further
notice all secondary contractors supplying parts or materials to airplane
manufacturers or aircraft assemblers will continue to be considered as
“subcontractors” and not subject to the provisions of the PCA under the regular
practice rule.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13a03 - PCA place of
performance chart.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The PCA place of
performance chart shown below may be used as a guide to readily determine the
geographic areas in which the PCA and PCA MW determinations apply. As provided
in Reg 50-201.603(b) and R&amp;I No. 3, Sec 4, this law does not apply to
“contracts for materials, supplies, articles, or equipment no part of which
will be manufactured or furnished within the geographic limits of the States of
the United States of America, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or the District
of Columbia.”</p>

<h3>13a04 - Contracts between
U.S. Government agencies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Contracts entered into
between one agency of the U.S. or the D.C. and another such agency are not
subject to the PCA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13a05 - Contracts between
the Federal Government and State agencies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The PCA applies in the
normal manner to contracts between municipalities, States, or State agencies,
as for example State schools, and the Federal Government. The fact that the
contracted labor is performed by State or municipal employees does not remove
the contract from the purview of the Act.</p>

<h3>13b00 - Post exchanges and
Navy exchanges.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Purchases by Army and
Air Force post exchanges and Navy exchanges for a variety of reasons are
considered as “open market” purchases under PCA Sec 9, and are, therefore, not
subject to the PCA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13b01 - Foreign aid
contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Coverage under the PCA
is not affected by the fact that the materials, articles, supplies, or
equipment are later transferred by the Government to a foreign nation.
Purchases by a foreign nation are not covered under the PCA, even though the
purchases are financed by United States loans.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13b02 - Coal dealers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Coal dealers need not
show compliance in making sporadic deliveries where the extent and timing of
such deliveries are unpredictable, insofar as their yard, dock, and subsequent
operations, including delivery, are concerned.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13b03 - Petroleum dealers
and refiners.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   General.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Contracts in the
petroleum industry may be awarded to a refiner that also operates its own
distribution facilities and makes deliveries pursuant to a PCA contract from
these facilities. In such cases, it is the position of Wage-Hour that the
question of whether such a contractor is a “manufacturer” or “regular dealer”
should be determined upon a realistic evaluation of all pertinent factors such
as the contract itself, the contractor’s operations and the obligations
actually assumed for the fulfillment of the contract requirements. Thus, for
example, where such a refiner is awarded a contract and makes deliveries to the
Government from a central distributing plant of products obtained from its own
refineries, it will be considered to have been awarded the contract as a
refiner and the rules in (b) below will apply to the contract. On the other
hand, if such a refiner makes deliveries to the Government through its own
distribution facilities, but the products are actually received from other
refineries, it will generally be considered to have been awarded the contract
as a dealer and the rules in (c) below will apply. If there is any question as
to whether the refiner is operating as a “manufacturer” or as a “regular dealer”
with respect to a particular contract, and compliance depends on this issue,
the facts shall be obtained and submitted through channels to the RS for
opinion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Refiners.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a refiner is
awarded a contract as a manufacturer, only the employees at the refinery are
covered by the PCA. (See R&amp;I No. 3, Sec 40(d).) Consequently, in such cases
truck drivers making deliveries to the Government from bulk stations rather
than from the refinery itself and other bulk station employees performing work
in connection with the delivery of products to the Government are not covered
by the PCA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Dealers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  As provided in R&amp;I No. 3, Sec 40(e)(1), where the
contractor is a dealer the PCA applies to employees at the “central
distributing plant” of the dealer who are employed in connection with the
storage and handling of petroleum products prior to delivery to the Government.
A central distributing plant within the meaning of Sec 40(e)(1) is a dealer’s
place or places of business where it initially receives products from its
suppliers which are to be furnished to the Government, where its distribution
operations thereon commence and from which the products are delivered either
directly to the Government or to other plants for such delivery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Depending upon the size and scope of its operations a
dealer may have at least one and sometimes more than one central distributing
plant. For example, where a dealer has only a single establishment and products
are received from suppliers for delivery to the Government from such establishment,
the single establishment constitutes the employer’s central distributing plant.
Similarly, where an employer has two or more establishments at which he or she
initially receives products from his or her suppliers for delivery either
directly to the Government or to other plants for delivery to the Government,
such establishments at which the products are initially received constitute
central distribution plants. Where products are delivered from such a central
distributing plant to other plants of the employer for delivery to the
Government, the latter plants represent “bulk stations” as that term is defined
in R&amp;I No. 3, Sec 40(e)(1).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Service station employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>R&amp;I No. 3, Sec
40(b)(1) provides that although the PCA stipulations are included in the
contract, such stipulations are inapplicable to employees working at service
stations. As used in this section the term “service stations” includes
establishments, whether owned or operated by the contractor or some other
person, engaged in selling fuel to operators of automotive vehicles, aircraft
and watercraft and is not the same as “gasoline service establishment” as used
in FLSA Sec 3(s)(5) or “gasoline service station” as used in old sec 13(b)(8).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Oil production on Government property.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of a firm
who are engaged in the production of crude oil from wells on property which is
wholly or partially owned by the Government, as in the instance of the Naval
Petroleum Reserve, are producing goods rather than furnishing services and
therefore covered by the PCA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13b04 - Contracts for
meals for Armed Services personnel.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Contracts awarded by
the Department of Defense for the furnishing and serving of meals to Armed
Services personnel are not subject to the PCA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13b05 - Department of
Defense commissaries.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Since Department of
Defense Commissaries do not have express statutory authority to purchase on the
open market, the exemption under Sec 9 of the PCA is not applicable to their
purchases.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13b06 - Multiple
contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>All bids from the same
person, as such term is defined in the PCA, pursuant to a single invitation for
bids constitute a single offer of sale within the meaning of the Act. The total
procurement from such person on such single invitation constitutes a single
award within the meaning of R&amp;I No. 3, Sec 3(e)(3), regardless of whether
one or more formal contracts are involved in such procurement. Where such total
procurement exceeds $10,000, the PCA applies to all work (subsequent to the
first date of award) in performance of the initial and all subsequent contracts
although each individual contract may not exceed $10,000.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13b07 - Air carrier
contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Any contracts between
the Department of the Air Force and air carriers subject to Title II of the
Railway Labor Act, made in furtherance of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Programs,
are exempt from the requirements of the PCA Sec 1(a) and, with respect to their
employees, from the requirements of PCA Sec 1(b) and (c).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13b08 - Purchase Notice
Agreements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   A Purchase Notice Agreement (PNA) is a written
contract between a supplier and a Government agency under which the supplier
lists its products and offers to sell them to the Government at certain prices.
As needs develop, the agency in turn submits a purchase order to one or another
of the suppliers with whom it has executed such an agreement. Upon receipt of
the order, the supplier fills it either from its existing stocks, by producing
the goods, by purchase from other sources, or by some combination of means.
This type of contract is often used by the Department of Defense to procure
perishable and nonperishable subsistence items, such as dairy products, bakery
products, and canned foods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Purchase Notice Agreements are “contracts” for purpose
of the PCA and the PCA applies as in the case of any other indefinite amount
contract if the aggregate total of purchases (excluding perishables, R&amp;I
No. 3, Sec 11) pursuant to the agreement may exceed $10,000, even though no
single purchase may exceed this amount. Further the “open market” exemption
does not apply in such cases (R&amp;I No. 3, Sec 13).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Where, under the PNA, the contractor is providing the
Government with goods which are identifiable as to the time the work on them is
performed, the stock-on-hand rule in Sec 24(a) of R&amp;I No. 3 rather than the
stockpile rule in Sec 24(b) governs. The stock-on-hand rule permits the
contractor to fill the Government order, if it can, from goods produced or
procured prior to the award of its contract. Under it, while the Act does not
apply retroactively to work performed prior to the award of the PNA contract,
it does apply as stated in paragraph (d) following, to work performed after the
date of the award of the PNA contract on the materials or articles supplied to
the Government.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  All work performed after the Government gives notice
to the contractor of award of the PNA, on goods which the contractor knows or
can anticipate with reasonable certainty at the time the work is done will be
supplied to the Government under the PNA, must be performed in compliance with
the representations and stipulations contained in the Act and incorporated in
the PNA. However, as stated in Sec 22 of R&amp;I No. 3, the necessity of
compliance with the representations and stipulations is confined to the period
of actual engagement in work on the contract, “provided the records of the
contractor adequately disclose the period during which Government work is being
performed”. Thus, if, after notice by the Government of award of a PNA, the
contractor performs work on goods embraced within its terms which the
contractor knows will not be used to fill purchase orders thereunder, the
contractor may perform the work on such goods without the necessity of
compliance with the Act’s stipulations and representations, provided its
records are adequate to segregate such work from Government work. But with
respect to work on any goods which, at the time of performance of such work,
the contractor knows or has reason to believe will be furnished to the
Government in response to purchase orders issued under the PNA, compliance
during the period while such goods are being worked on is required without
regard to whether the purchase order under which the goods will actually be
furnished to the Government has been issued.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   It will be noted that under paragraph (d) the date of
award for purposes of the stock-on-hand rule is the date of award of the PNA
rather than of the particular purchase order under it. As provided in Sec 22 of
R&amp;I No. 3, compliance with the representations and stipulations of the Act
and regulations is required during all of “the period in which the contractor
is actually engaged in the performance of work on the contract”. The period in
which the contractor is so engaged will necessarily include any period after
issuance of a purchase order under the PNA during which work is performed on
the specific goods supplied under that purchase order. The reason for this,
however, is not because the date of the purchase order, rather than the date of
the PNA, is the date of the award of the contract. The controlling factor is
that at such time there can be no room for doubt that the contractor is
actually engaged in the performance of work “on the contract” embodied in the
PNA. With respect to work done on goods after notice of the PNA but before issuance
of the purchase order which is filled with such goods, a careful evaluation of
all the facts should be made to determine whether the contractor actually knew
or could anticipate with reasonable certainty at the time such work was
performed that the goods worked on would be supplied to the Government under
the PNA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   In any case when the application of this instruction
is not clear, the matter shall be submitted through channels to the RS for
opinion. Because of the complex issues, the Field should proceed very carefully
in cases involving PNA’s.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13b09 - Trucking of coal.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The trucking of coal,
destined for the Federal Government under a prime contract subject to PCA, is
covered by the PCA regardless of whether the trucking is performed by employees
of the primary contractor or by employees of an independent secondary
contractor. Since the coal being transported is destined for the Government, an
independent secondary contractor is engaged in the manufacturing or furnishing
of the very items which the prime contractor has agreed to manufacture or
furnish. (See also R&amp;I No. 3, Sec 15.)</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>13b10 - Job Corps
facilities.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The PCA does not apply
to primary contracts entered into by the Government with private firms for the
operation of a job corps camp or facility. However, secondary contracts let by
the contractor for those materials, supplies, etc., necessary to such
facilities, and which the operator is authorized to procure for or on behalf of
the Government, may be subject to the PCA if the tests for coverage are met.
Such contracts awarded for or on behalf of the job corps camp or facility by
its operating contractor will be subject to the Act to the same extent and
under the same conditions as if they were awarded by the Government directly.
(See also FOH 14a13.)</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>13b11 - Contracts for the
construction, alteration, furnishing, or equipping of naval vessels.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>PCA coverage involving
work performed on boats and ships is explained in Sec 7 of R&amp;I No. 3.  The
status of a Coast Guard ship is considered to be that of a “naval vessel” for
purposes of that Sec. (See FOH 14a19, 15c17 and 15e14.)</p>

<h3>13c00 - Convict labor -
prospective parolees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The term “convict labor”, as used in Sec 1(d) of the
PCA, does not preclude employment on a covered PCA contract of persons who are
permitted to leave prison prior to the end of a sentence or prior to official
parole and establish residence (including residence in a so-called “Half-Way
House”) and obtain employment in the open market at the regular wages for the
work performed. This would be true even though residence and employment
conditions are closely supervised under a State or Federally sponsored system.
The employment must be voluntary (i.e., not “forced” employment in connection
with rehabilitation) and earnings must be retained by the employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Where “convict labor” is used on a covered PCA
contract that satisfies the provisions of Sec 1761(c) of Title 18, United
States Code, the prohibition in Sec 1(d) of the PCA does not apply. Sec 1761(c)
permits the employment of convicts or prisoners participating in a program of
pilot projects designated by the Office of Justice Assistance, Research, and
Statistics of the U.S. Department of Justice who:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  receive wages at rates not less than that paid for
work of a similar nature in the locality in which the work is to be performed.
Such wages may be subject to deductions not to exceed 80% of gross wages and
shall be limited to:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     taxes (Federal, State, local);</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     reasonable charges for room and board as determined by
regulations issued by the chief State correctional officer;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     allocations for support of family pursuant to State
law, court order, or agreement by the offender;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
d.     contribution to any fund established by law to
compensate victims of crime of not more than 20% of gross wages but not less
than 5% of gross wages;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  have not solely by their status as offenders been
deprived of the right to participate in benefits made available by Federal or
State Government to other individuals on the basis of their employment, such as
worker’s compensation. However, such convicts or prisoners shall not be
qualified to receive unemployment compensation while incarcerated;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  have participated in such employment voluntarily and
agreed in advance to the above specific deductions from gross wages and all
other financial arrangements as a result of participation in such employment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Moreover, the term “convict labor” does not apply
where Federal prisoners are released under the terms of the Prisoner
Rehabilitation Act of 1965 (18 U.S.C. 4082), or under a comparable State
rehabilitation program, to work in the community. Under this arrangement,
prisoners are permitted to work in part of a day at regular employment and
return to custody at the end of the workday, provided:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  the prisoner is paid or is in an approved work
training program on a voluntary basis;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  representatives of local union central bodies or
similar labor union organizations have been consulted;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  such employment does not displace other workers, or be
applied in skills, crafts, or trades in which there is a surplus of available
gainful labor in the locality, or impair existing contracts for services; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  the rates of pay and other conditions of employment
will not be less than those paid or provided for work of a similar nature in
the locality where the work is to be performed. The employment must meet the
PCA MW and OT standards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Executive Order 11755, dated December 29, 1973, also
permits the employment of non-Federal prisoners under the same conditions set
forth in subsection (c) above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   The Department of Justice is responsible for
administering the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1761(c), 18 U.S.C. 4082, and
Executive Order 11755. Therefore, questions or complaints pertaining to the
above provisions should be directed to the local U.S. Attorney’s Office.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>13c01 - Use of the
fluctuating w/w under PCA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer may
compensate employees who are subject to the PCA on the basis of the fluctuating
w/w method of payment provided that all of the criteria set forth in IB 778.114
are met, which includes the requirement that additional half-time OT be paid
for hours of work in excess of 40 per week. (Note: Work performed prior to
1/1/86 on contracts covered by PCA is subject to OT pay at time and one-half
for all hours worked in excess of eight in a day or 40 per week, whichever are
greater. PCA was amended by Public Law 99-145, effective 1/1/86, to eliminate
the daily OT provisions. Thus, employees paid on a fluctuating w/w basis under
PCA prior to 1/1/86 must receive OT pay for hours of work in excess of 8 per
day rather than 40 per week if the hours over 8/day are greater than the hours
over 40/week.)</p>

<h3>14a00 - Purpose and use of FOH Chapter 14.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This chapter supplements 29
C.F.R. Part 4, which contains the U.S. Department of Labor’s regulations and
interpretations with respect to the McNamara-O’Hara Service Contract Act of
1965, as amended. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14a01 - The McNamara-O’Hara Service Contract Act (SCA or the Act).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The SCA (41 U.S.C. § 351, et
seq.) applies to every contract entered into by the United States or the
District of Columbia, the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in
the United States through the use of service employees. Contractors performing
on such Federal service contracts in excess of $2,500 must observe minimum wage
and safety and health standards, and maintain certain records. Service
employees on covered contracts in excess of $2,500 must be paid not less than
the monetary wages and fringe benefits contained in wage determinations issued
by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) for the contract work. Such wage and
fringe benefit determinations may reflect what has been determined to be
prevailing in the locality, or may reflect the wage rates and fringe benefits
contained in the predecessor contractor’s collective bargaining agreement (CBA),
if any, pursuant to Section 4(c) of the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R. Part 4.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14a02 - The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The FLSA (29 U.S.C. § 201,
et seq.) prescribes standards for the basic minimum wage and overtime pay that
may affect SCA-covered contracts. The FLSA interacts with the SCA in three key
ways:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Section 2(b)(1) of the SCA provides that no contractor
or subcontractor shall pay any employee engaged in performing work on a covered
contract less that the minimum wage specified under Section 6(a)(1) of the
FLSA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.159.) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Section 8(b) of the SCA defines the term &quot;service
employee&quot; as any person engaged in the performance of a contract or that
portion of a contract subject to the SCA except those employees in bona fide
executive, administrative, or professional capacities as those terms are
defined in the FLSA regulations found at 29 C.F.R. Part 541. (See 41 U.S.C.
357(b); 29 C.F.R. 4.113.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Section 6 of the SCA recognizes that other Federal
laws, such as the FLSA, may require overtime compensation to be paid to service
employees working on or in connection with contracts subject to the SCA. (See
41 U.S.C. 355; SCA, 29 C.F.R. 4.180-4.182; FLSA 29 C.F.R. Part 778.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14a03 - The Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The SCA recognizes that other
Federal laws, such as the CWHSSA, may require overtime compensation to be paid
to service employees working on or in connection with contracts subject to the
SCA. The CWHSSA is more limited in scope than the FLSA and generally applies to
government contracts in excess of $100,000 that require or involve the
employment of laborers or mechanics, including guards and “watchmen.” (See SCA
29 C.F.R. 4.180-4.182; CWHSSA 29 C.F.R. 5.5(b).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14a04 - WDOL.gov website.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>WDOL.gov (http://www.wdol.gov)
provides a single website for access to federal contract labor standards
information and wage determinations (WDs) issued under the SCA and the
Davis-Bacon Act (DBA). (See 29 C.F.R. 4.4(c).)</p>

<h3>14b00 - SCA - Statutory provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Absent an exemption under Sections 4(b) or 7 of the
Act, Section 2(a) mandates that every contract entered into by any agency or
instrumentality of the United States or the District of Columbia in excess of
$2,500, the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in the United
States through the use of service of employees, must contain:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Specified minimum monetary wages
(MWs) and fringe benefits (FBs) determined by the Secretary of Labor (S/L) that
are based upon wage rates and fringe benefits prevailing in the locality (or,
in certain circumstances, the wage rates and fringe benefits contained in a
collective bargaining agreement, if any, applicable to employees who performed
on a predecessor contract) to be paid to the various classes of service
employees employed by the contractor or any subcontractor in performance of the
contract or subcontract;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
A requirement that working
conditions provided by or under the control of the contractor or subcontractor
meet safety and health standards; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
A requirement that notice be given
to service employees on the day they commence work of the compensation due them
under the minimum wage and fringe benefit provisions of the contract (or that
such notice be posted in a prominent place at the worksite); and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
A statement of the wage rates and
fringe benefits that would be paid by the contracting agency to the various
classes of service employees if such employees were hired directly by the
agency to perform the contract work. This statement is included in contracts
for informational purposes only. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The remaining sections of the SCA direct DOL to
administer and enforce the Act, and give no authority to contracting agencies
to issue final coverage determinations. DOL must ultimately decide any issue
concerning coverage under the SCA. (See 41 U.S.C. 351 et seq.; 29 C.F.R.
4.101(b), 4.102.)</p>
<p>            </p>

<h3>14b01 - Coverage – general.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The SCA applies to contracts entered into by the
United States or the District of Columbia, the principal purpose of which is to
furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.107-4.114.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Specifications for services in a contract which is not
as a whole principally for services are not subject to the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.111(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Contracts for services which are performed essentially
by employees that qualify for exemption as bona fide executive, administrative,
or professional employees under the FLSA and involve only a minor or incidental
use of service employees would not require application of the SCA. (See SCA 29
C.F.R 4.113(a)(3); FLSA 29 C.F.R. Part 541.) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  The term “contractor” as used in the contract clauses
required by the SCA also applies to any subcontractors. When a contractor
undertakes a contract subject to the SCA, the contractor agrees to assume the
obligations that the labor standards will be observed in furnishing the
required services. These obligations may not be relieved by shifting all or
part of the work to another, and the prime contractor is jointly and severally
liable with any subcontractor for any underpayments that constitute a violation
of the prime contract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.114.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14b02 - Agency of the United States or District of Columbia.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Section 2(a) of the SCA covers contracts (and any bid
specification therefor) “entered into by the United States or the District of
Columbia,” and Section 2(b) applies to contracts entered into “with the Federal
Government.” Within the meaning of these provisions, contracts entered into by
the United States and contracts with the Federal government include all
contracts to which any agency or instrumentality of the United States
Government becomes a party. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.107.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Contracts of the District of Columbia include all
contracts of all agencies and instrumentalities of the District which procure
services for, or on behalf of, the District or under the authority of the
District. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.108.) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14b03 - Contracts to furnish services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Based on the language of the SCA, if a contract is
“entered into” by or with the Government, and if its principal purpose is “to
furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees,” it
is subject to the SCA. (See 41 U.S.C. § 351(a).) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The SCA is intended to be applied to a wide variety of
service contracts. To illustrate this point, the SCA regulations provide a
listing of examples of contracts that have been found to come within its
coverage. (See 29 C.F.R. § 4.130(a).) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The nomenclature, type, or particular form of contract
used is not determinative of SCA coverage. Contracts can be in writing, the
result of competitive bidding, awarded on a cost plus basis to a single source
(“sole” source), a purchase order, or a telephone call to a contractor. (See 29
C.F.R. § 4.111(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Contracts do not have to involve direct services to
the government or an agency, nor do they require the expenditure of funds by an
agency. Concessionaire contracts in which the contractor provides a service to
individual personnel or the general public, for which he or she charges a fee
to the user and then remits a portion of sale receipts to the government, are
contracts for purposes of the SCA unless exempted. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.133; FOH
14d00.)     </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14b04 - Geographical scope of the Act.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Currently, the SCA applies to the 50 States, the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Outer Continental Shelf
lands as defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, American Samoa,
Guam, Wake Island, Eniwetok Atoll, Kwajalein Atoll, Johnston Island, Canton
Island and the Northern Marianas. (See 41 U.S.C. 357(d); 29 C.F.R. 4.112(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The term “United States” excludes any United States
base or possession within a foreign country. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.112(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   For contracts in which any part of the services will
be performed within the geographic limits of the United States, the SCA and
appropriate WD must be incorporated in the bid documents and contract, and the service
employees must be paid the proper SCA rates for all hours worked within these
geographic limits. Work performed outside the geographic limits of the United
States, even if pursuant to a contract for services that is performed in part
in the United States, is not subject to the requirements of the SCA. (See 29
C.F.R 4.112(b).) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14b05 - “Service employee”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Section 8(b) of the Act defines “service employee” as
any person engaged in the performance of a covered contract except those
persons who individually qualify for an FLSA exemption as bona fide executive,
administrative or professional employees as defined in FLSA 29 C.F.R. Part 541.
(See 41 U.S.C. 357(b); 29 C.F.R. 4.113, 4.156; FOH 14c07.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The SCA applies to all persons who actually perform
the service work called for by a covered contract, “regardless of any
contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a contractor or
subcontractor and such person,” except those persons expressly exempted from
the definition of “service employee.” If a person is engaged in performing any service
work called for under a covered contract, such person must be paid the wage and
FBs provided under the Act, irrespective of any alleged “independent
contractor” or non-employment relationship. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.155.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Employees who do not perform the services required by a
contract in excess of $2,500 principally for services, but whose duties are
necessary to the performance thereof, as, for example, clerical employees who
handle paper work in connection with the contract (such as billing or
payrolls), must be paid not less than the MW specified under Section 6(a)(1) of
the FLSA assuming such MW obligations apply. (See 41 U.S.C. 351(b)(1); 29
C.F.R. 4.153.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Most occupational titles for service employees listed
on SCA area-wide prevailing WDs are defined in the “Service Contract Act
Directory of Occupations,” which can be accessed via the WDOL.gov website (<a href="http://www.wdol.gov">http://www.wdol.gov</a>). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Occupational titles contained in SCA WDs based on CBA
provisions will be defined by the terms of the CBA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(j).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14b06 - Contract clauses.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The amount of the contract is not determinative of the
Act’s coverage although the statutory requirements and the contract clauses are
different for contracts in excess of $2,500 and for contracts of a lesser
amount. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.159.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Contracts exceeding $2,500.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In every covered contract in
excess of $2,500 or with no definite amount, the agency is required to include
the SCA labor standards contract clauses set forth in 29 C.F.R. § 4.6. In
addition to other matters, such as R/K requirements and a summary of
liabilities and penalties for violations, these clauses contain the basic
provisions of Sections 2(a)(1) through (4) of the Act relating to: payment of
prevailing MW rates, furnishing of FBs, observance of S&amp;H standards, and
notice of compensation to employees (posting). In the absence of a WD attached
to the contract specifying the prevailing rate or rates to be paid and the FBs
to be furnished, the clauses also provide that neither the prime contractor nor
any subcontractor shall pay any employees performing work on the contract less
than the MW required by Section 6(a)(1) of the FLSA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6, 4.150,
4.159.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The labor standards contract clauses included in the
prime contract are by their terms required to be included as well in any
subcontract or any lower tier subcontract made thereunder. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.114,
4.151.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Contracts not exceeding $2,500.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The only clause required in
Federal service contracts of $2,500 or less is the clause reflecting the basic
provisions of Section 2(b)(1) of the SCA relating to the payment of the MW
required by Section 6(a)(1) of the FLSA to employees engaged in performing work
on the contract. However, pursuant to Section 18 of the FLSA, no provision of
the FLSA shall excuse noncompliance with any federal, state or local law
establishing a MW higher than the FLSA MW. WHD staff will not interpret or
enforce any law other than those administered by the WHD, and States cannot
interpret or enforce the SCA or FLSA. (See 41 U.S.C. 351(b)(1); 29 C.F.R.
4.150; FOH 32j01.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Determining contract amount.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The value of the contract is
determined by either the amount to be paid for the service or the amount which
the contractor receives for providing the service. For example, concession
contracts are considered to be contracts in excess of $2,500 if the
contractor's gross receipts under the contract may exceed $2,500. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.141.) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   CWHSSA contract clauses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any federal contract in
excess of $100,000 that requires or involves the employment of “laborers” and
“mechanics,” including “watchmen” and guards, is subject to the  overtime
provisions of CWHSSA. Such contracts, which may include SCA-covered contracts
that employ many classes of service employees that fall within the terms 
“laborers” and “mechanics,” should include CWHSSA’s contract clauses set forth
in  29 C.F.R. 5.5(b). However, failure to incorporate the CWHSSA contract
clauses into a contract does not preclude CWHSSA coverage. (See SCA 29 C.F.R.
4.181(b); Davis-Bacon Act (DBA) 29 C.F.R. 5.5(b); FOH 15g02.)   </p>
<p>            </p>

<h3>14b07 - Child labor.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The SCA contains no CL
requirements. However, if the employer is covered under the FLSA, the FLSA CL
provisions are applicable. (See FLSA 29 C.F.R. Parts 570 and 579; FOH 33.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14c00 - Statutory exemptions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Section 7 of the Act
specifically exempts from coverage seven types of contracts (or work) which
might otherwise be subject to the SCA. (See 41 U.S.C. 356(1) - (7);  29 C.F.R.
4.115-4.122.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Any contract covered by the DBA for construction,
alteration and/or repair, including painting and decorating of public buildings
or public works. (See 41 U.S.C. 356(1); 29 C.F.R. 4.116.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Any work required to be done in accordance with the
provisions of the PCA. (See 41 U.S.C. 356(2); SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.117; 41 U.S.C. 35,
et seq.; PCA 41 C.F.R. Part 50-201.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Any contract for the carriage of freight or personnel
by vessel, airplane, bus, truck, express railway line or oil or gas pipeline
where published tariff rates are in effect. (See 41 U.S.C. 356(3); 29 C.F.R. 4.118.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
This exemption applies only to
contracts for carriage by a common carrier. A transportation service contract
is exempt only if the service is actually governed by published tariff rates in
effect pursuant to State or Federal law. The contracts between the Government
and the carrier would be evidenced by a Government “bill of lading” citing
published tariff rates. (See AAM No. 185.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
This exemption typically does not
apply to contracts for ambulance or taxicab services as they are usually not
deemed common carriers or governed by published tariff rates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Mail haul contracts are not exempt
because “mail” is not considered to be “freight” under Federal law.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
Contracts principally for packing,
crating, and warehousing of household goods are also not exempt (even if
performed by a “common carrier”) as the primary purpose of the contract is the
warehousing (i.e., storage) of household goods, while the local hauling is a
minor, incidental purpose of the contract. (See also FOH 14c05.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Any contract for the furnishing of services by radio,
telephone, telegraph, or cable companies subject to the Communications Act of
1934, 47 U.S.C. 151, et seq.. (See 41 U.S.C. 356(4); 29 C.F.R. 4.119.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
This exemption does not apply to
any contracts where such companies are furnishing other kinds of services
through the use of service employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The Communications Act of 1934,
has been amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. (See P.L. 104 - 104, 47
U.S.C. 151, et seq. (1996).) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Any contract for public utility services, including
electric light and power, water, steam, and gas. (See 41 U.S.C. 356(5); 29
C.F.R. 4.120.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
This exemption is applicable to
contracts for such services with companies whose rates are regulated under
federal, state, or local law governing operations of public utility
enterprises.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Contracts covered by this
exemption include those between federal electric power marketing agencies and
investor-owned electric utilities, Rural Electrification Administration
cooperatives, municipalities, and state agencies engaged in transmission and
sale of electric power and energy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Contracts entered into with public
utility companies to furnish services through the use of service employees,
other than those subject to “rate regulation”, are not exempt from the SCA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Any employment contract providing for direct services
to a federal agency by an individual or individuals. (See 41 U.S.C. 356(6); 29
C.F.R. 4.121.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Any contract with the U.S. Postal Service, the
principal purpose of which is the operation of postal contract stations. (See
41 U.S.C. 356(7); 29 C.F.R. 4.122.)              </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14c01 - Other exemptions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Section 4(b) of the SCA as
amended in 1972 authorizes the S/L (delegated to the Administrator) to “provide
such reasonable limitations” and to “make such rules and regulations allowing
reasonable variation, tolerances, and exemptions to and from any or all
provisions of this [Act (other than Section 10)], but only in special
circumstances where [it is determined that] such limitation, variation,
tolerance, or exemption is necessary and proper in the public interest or to
avoid the serious impairment of government business, and is in accord with the
remedial purpose of this [Act] to protect prevailing labor standards.” (See 41
U.S.C. 353(b); 29 C.F.R. 4.123.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The following types of contracts have been exempted
from all of the provisions of the SCA pursuant to Section 4(b):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Postal Service contracts entered
into with common carriers for the carriage of mail by rail, air (except air
star routes), bus and ocean vessel on regularly scheduled runs where the
revenue received for the carriage of the mail is insubstantial. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.123(d)(1).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Postal Service contracts entered
into with individual owner-operators of vehicles for transportation of mail
where it is not contemplated at the time the contract is made that the
owner-operator will hire any service employee except for brief periods of time
such as vacation, or for unexpected contingencies or emergency situations such
as illness or accident. Application of this exemption depends on conditions
existing at the time the contract is made. If the criteria for the exemption
have been met, then SCA WD requirements would not apply to anyone subsequently
engaged in the performance of the contract services during the term of the
contract for reasons within the limitations described in 29 C.F.R. 4.123(d)(2).
The term owner-operator refers to an individual, not a partnership, two closely
related individuals (“mom &amp; pop operations”), or a corporation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Contracts for the carriage of
freight or personnel where such carriage is subject to rates covered by Sec
10721 of the Interstate Commerce Act. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(d)(3).);</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
Prime contracts and subcontracts
for the seven types of “commercial services” identified immediately below where
an employee’s work on a Government service contract represents a small portion
of time when compared to the balance of time spent on commercial work and where
additional specific criteria for exclusion from SCA coverage are satisfied.
This exemption does not apply to solicitations and contracts for any of the
seven services listed below that are: (1) entered into under the
Javits-Wagner-O’Day Act, 41 U.S.C. 47; (2) for the operation of a Government
facility or portion thereof (“GOCO” or “GOPO”) (but may apply to subcontracts);
or (3) subject to Section 4(c) of the SCA, as well as options or extensions
under contracts subject to Section 4(c) provisions. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.123(e)(2).) The seven commercial services are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     Automotive (fleet of automobiles) or other vehicle
(e.g., aircraft) normal maintenance services (other than contracts to operate a
Government motor pool). (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(A).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     Financial services involving the issuance and
servicing of cards (including credit cards, debit cards, purchase cards, smart
cards, and similar card services) for use by traveling Federal employees or to
make small purchases of commercial items to meet the day-to-day needs of a
Federal agency. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(B).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     Contracts with hotels/motels for conferences of
limited duration (e.g., 1-5 days) that may include lodging, meals, and space
(e.g., conference rooms) as part of the contract. This exemption does not cover
contracts for lodging on an as needed or continuing basis (e.g., lodging for
military recruits or for employees attending training at a training center over
a longer period of time). (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(C).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
d.     Maintenance, calibration, repair, and/or installation
(not subject to the DBA, as provided in 29 C.F.R. 4.116(c)(2)) for all types of
equipment where the services are obtained from the manufacturer or supplier
under a contract awarded on a sole source basis. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.123(e)(2)(i)(D).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
e.     Transportation by common carrier of persons by air,
motor vehicle, rail, or marine vessel on regularly scheduled routes or via
standard commercial services (e.g., “City Pairs” contracts) (does not include
charter services). (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(E).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
f.     Real estate services, including real property
appraisal services related to housing Federal agencies or disposing of real
property owned by the Federal government. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(F).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
g.     Relocation services, including services of real estate
brokers and appraisers, to assist Federal employees or military personnel in
buying and selling homes (which shall not include actual moving or storage of
household goods and related services). (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(G).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The following categories of service employees have a
variation to the prevailing wage requirements pursuant to Section 4(b):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Workers with disabilities –</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The SCA, like the FLSA, allows an employer to pay
apprentices, student-learners, workers with disabilities in competitive
employment, and workers with disabilities in rehabilitation facilities at
special minimum wages (SMWs) that are less than the prevailing wages required
by the WD. The SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.6(o) instructs the employer to follow the same
&quot;conditions and procedures&quot; required for the employment of such workers
as are set forth in Section 14 of the FLSA. This regulatory exception is from
the prevailing wage only. Employers are still required to pay the full FBs, or
equivalent cash payment in lieu of providing FBs, to service employees with
disabilities for the work performed. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(o)(1) and 4.152(c)(2).)
A SMW or commensurate wage will be based upon the prevailing wage listed in the
applicable SCA WD for the classification of work to be performed on the
contract. It will be determined by the individual productivity of the workers
with disabilities in proportion to the productivity of experienced workers
without disabilities who perform essentially the same type, quality, and
quantity of work. (See SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.6(o)(1); FLSA 29 C.F.R. Part 525)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Apprentices –</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the
SCA predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and
individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a
State apprenticeship agency that is recognized by DOL, or, if no such
recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office
of Apprenticeship, ETA, DOL. The terms and conditions of the approved program
will be followed in the employment of apprentices. Wage rates paid apprentices
must not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in
the registered program, usually expressed as a percentage of the
journeyworker’s rate in the applicable WD. The allowable ratio of apprentices
to journeyworkers employed on the contract work must not be greater than the
ratio permitted to the contractor under the registered program. Any employee
who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program must be paid the
wage rate and FBs contained in the applicable WD for the journeyworker
classification of work actually performed. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(p).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14c02  Maintenance and repair of
certain ADP, scientific, medical, office, and business equipment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Pursuant to Section 4(b) of the SCA, the S/L has
exempted from all provisions of the Act contracts which are principally for the
maintenance, calibration, and/or repair of:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
ADP equipment and office
information/word processing equipment;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Scientific equipment and medical
apparatus or equipment where the application of microelectronic circuitry or
other technology of at least similar sophistication is an essential element;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Office/business machines not
otherwise exempt under (1) above, where such services are performed by the
manufacturer or supplier of the equipment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  This exemption is limited to the servicing of only the
listed items of equipment furnished to the government that are also furnished
commercially to the general public. The contract services must be furnished at
catalog or market prices, and the contractor must utilize the same compensation
plan for service employees performing on government work as it uses for its
employees who service such equipment for commercial customers. The contractor
must certify to all of these conditions in the contract. In addition, the
contracting officer is required to make an affirmative determination that the
conditions of the exemption have been met prior to contract award. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.123(e)(1).)</p>
<p>            </p>

<h3>14c03 - Carpet installation.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Section 7(1) of the SCA exempts from coverage contracts
for construction, alteration, and/or repair, including painting or decorating,
of public buildings or public works which are subject to the DBA. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.116.) Where carpet laying is performed as an integral part of, or in
conjunction with, “new” construction, alteration, or reconstruction of a public
building or a public work, as opposed to routine maintenance, the DBA would be
applicable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Where the installation of carpeting is performed as a
separate contract and is not an integral part of either a construction project
or incidental to a supply contract, the installation work would be subject to
the SCA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14c04 - Overhaul and modification of
aircraft and other equipment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Section 7(2) of the SCA exempts from its provisions
“any work required to be done in accordance with the provisions the
Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act.” (See 41 U.S.C. 356(2); FOH 14c00(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The regulations provide detailed guidelines for
delineating when contracts for major overhaul of equipment would be considered
“remanufacturing” subject to the PCA rather than the SCA. Complete or
substantial teardown and overhaul of heavy construction equipment, aircraft,
engines, etc., where the Government receives a totally rebuilt end item with a
new (or nearly new) life expectancy resulting from processes similar to
original manufacturing, will normally be considered “remanufacturing” subject
to the PCA so long as the work is performed in a facility owned and operated by
the contractor. Contracts for routine maintenance or repair, inspection, etc.,
continue to be subject to the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.117.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Contracting agencies are required
to initially determine whether work to be performed under a proposed contract
would involve principally “remanufacturing” work or service work based on the
guidelines, and incorporate the appropriate PCA or SCA labor standards clauses
into the contract prior to soliciting bids. Application of the SCA or PCA to
any type of contract not discussed in the regulations will be decided on a
case-by-case basis by the Administrator. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.117(b)(4).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14c05 - Storage and local drayage of
household goods.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Contracts for the carriage or transportation of goods
or personnel must be actually governed by published tariff rates for such
carriage in order for the Section 7(3) exemption to apply. An administrative
exemption has also been provided for certain contracts where such carriage is subject
to Section 10721 of the Interstate Commerce Act. (See 41 U.S.C. 356(3); 29
C.F.R. 4.118, 4.123(d)(3); FOH 14c00(c).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The Section 7(3) exemption does
not apply where the principal purpose of the contract is packing, crating,
handling, loading, and/or storage of goods prior to, or following, line-haul
transportation to the ultimate destination. The fact that substantial local
drayage to and from the contractor’s establishment may also be required does
not alter the fact that the principal purpose of such a contract is other than
the carriage of freight. However, if a firm has a separate contract for
transportation subject to a published tariff rate, the Section 7(3) exemption
would apply to that contract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.118; FOH 14c00(c).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14c06 - Shipbuilding, alteration and
repair, as distinguished from maintenance and/or cleaning.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The building, alteration, and repair of ships under
Government contract is work performed upon “public works” and is within the Section
7(1) exemption (i.e., such work is DBA-covered, except as provided in (b) below).
Thus, for example, the SCA will not apply to contracts for the alteration and
repair of merchant ships let by the Maritime Administration. (See 41 U.S.C.
356(1).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  A contract for the construction, alteration, furnishing,
or equipping of a naval vessel, i.e., U.S. Navy (including U.S. Coast Guard
vessels), is within the Section 7(2) exemption for work subject to the PCA.
(See 10 U.S.C. 7299; 41 U.S.C. 356(2).) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   A contract that calls principally for the maintenance
and/or cleaning, rather than alteration or repair, of a ship or naval vessel,
is a service contract within the meaning of the SCA. (See 15d11.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14c07 - Contracts which have as their
principal purpose the procurement of a type of service where service employees
will not be used.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Coverage of the Act does not extend to contracts for
services to be performed exclusively by persons who are not service employees,
i.e., persons who qualify as bona fide executive, administrative, or
professional personnel as defined in the FLSA regulations found at 29 C.F.R.
Part 541. For example, a contract for professional services performed
essentially by bona fide professional employees, with the use of service
employees being only a minor factor in contract performance, is not covered by
the SCA. However, a contract for professional services that requires the use of
service employees to a significant or substantial extent (in terms of number of
employees or hours worked) is covered by the SCA, even though professional
employees may be used in the performance of the contract. (See 41 U.S.C.
357(b); 29 C.F.R. 4.113(a)(3), 4.156; FOH 14b05.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  In practice, a 10 to 20 percent guideline has been
used to determine whether there is more than a minor use of service employees.
(See Preamble at 48 Fed. Reg. 49736, 49743-44 (Oct. 27, 1983).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Coverage of the Act will not extend to contracts where
it is contemplated that the services will be performed individually by the
contractor, and the contracting officer knows when advertising for bids or
concluding negotiations that service employees will in no event be used by the
contractor in providing the contract services. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.113(a).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14d00 - Beneficiary of contract services – concessionaires, etc.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Where the principal purpose of a Government contract
is to furnish services through the use of service employees, the contract is
subject to the SCA regardless of who is the direct beneficiary of the services,
or the source of the funds from which the contractor is paid for the service,
and irrespective of whether the contractor performs the work in its own
establishment, on a Government installation, or elsewhere. The fact that the
contract requires or permits the contractor to provide the services directly to
individual government personnel as a concessionaire rather than through a
contracting agency does not negate SCA coverage. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.133(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  An administrative exemption is provided in 29 C.F.R. 4.133(b)
for certain concession contracts, such as those entered into by the National
Park Service, including National Forests and in the National Wildlife Refuge
System, which are principally for the furnishing of food, lodging, automobile
fuel, souvenirs, newspaper stands, and recreational equipment to the general
public as opposed to furnishing such services to the United States Government
or its personnel. This exemption does not affect a concession contractor’s
obligation to comply with the labor standards provisions of any other statutes
such as the CWHSSA, DBA, and FLSA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.133(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Questions arise in distinguishing between a contract
whose principal purpose is the furnishing of services through the use of
service employees (subject to the SCA) and a contract which is not for the
purpose of procuring services, but rather only sets forth general conditions
under which persons desiring to transact business with individuals on Government
installations may enter and do so. Such agreements are not subject to the SCA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
For example, where the concession
contract provides for the use of Government space or equipment on the
installation for the activity involved, or prescribes to a significant extent
conditions relating to prices, performance, and quality or type of service, the
contract would generally be considered to have as its principal purpose the
furnishing of services desired by the Government for its personnel, and be
subject to the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.133(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
In contrast, SCA coverage would
not be asserted on a concession contract or agreement which merely requires a
contractor to comply with general police regulations designed to control
traffic, maintain order, and suppress nuisances. SCA coverage would not be
asserted where the requirements imposed by the contract or agreement on the
contractor are limited to such matters as restricting solicitation or pick-up
practices to specified areas on the installation, restricting hours of
operation, requiring observance of speed limits, or other rules and regulations
generally applicable to those permitted to do business on a Government
installation. Also, absent other evidence that the contract’s purpose is to
secure services, SCA coverage will not be asserted by reason of inclusion in
the contract of requirements to ensure the responsibility of the contractor
such as bonding or licensing requirements.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14d01 - Vending machine concession agreements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   If a vending machine contractor is obligated to
furnish, install, stock, and service the vending machines; maintain such
machines in efficient working order; make any necessary repairs; and maintain
them in a clean, attractive, orderly and sanitary condition, the contract would
be subject to the SCA. Under such a contract, the contractor’s function is
primarily that of furnishing a service, rather than a mere sale of supplies
since it contemplates a continuing use of service employees to carry out the
contract. The question of who owns the items available from the machines at the
time a purchase is made is immaterial to the application of the SCA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  If a contractor has an agreement as described in (a)
above where a continuing use of service employees is involved, the delivery
route personnel and any employees performing any servicing of the machines
would be covered by the SCA. Additionally, it is the position of WH that the
production employees’ work involves the performance of duties necessary to the
accomplishment of the contract and such employees must be paid not less than
the MW required by Section 2(b) of the Act. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.153.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Where the Government enters into either a leasing or
rental/purchase agreement with regard to vending machines under which the
Government agency stocks and services the machines with the contractor merely
delivering the goods to a designated storage area, such an agreement is not
subject to SCA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14d02 - Exploratory drilling.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Contracts for subsurface
exploration, which have as their principal purpose the furnishing of technical
information, together with soil samples and rock cores, and/or a record to the
Government of what was encountered during subsurface drilling, are subject to
the SCA if such drilling operations are not directly connected with the
construction of a public work (in which case they would be DBA covered). (See
FOH 15d05.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14d03 - Gathering and processing of geophysical and seismic data.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where the principal purpose
of a contract is to gather, compile, analyze, and report geophysical and
seismic data, such contracts are covered by the SCA even though certain
tangible end items (paper, maps, or manuscripts) may result from the
intelligence, information, and labor service. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.131(a) and (e).)
Thus, while professional services may be involved and individual employees may
be exempt under FLSA 29 C.F.R. Part 541, the “principal purpose” of such
contracts is to provide services which could not be furnished without a
significant number of logistic support service workers to carry out the survey
work. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.130(a)(21); FOH 14c07.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14d04 - Surveying and mapping services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Contracts for surveying and
mapping services for transmission lines, highways, dams, etc., are subject to
the SCA, even if they are preliminary to construction. Such contracts would not
be subject to the SCA if they are directly related to construction (instead,
they would be DBA covered). (See 29 C.F.R. 4.130(a)(46).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14d05 - Contracts with hotels, motels, and restaurants for lodging and meals.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   A contract between the Government and a hotel or
restaurant for furnishing of lodging and/or meals is a service contract within
the meaning of the SCA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The various branches of the military issue “chits” to
military personnel so that meals, lodging, or transportation may be obtained.
The name of the vendor is left blank and the “chit” may be exchanged for
overnight lodging, meals, or transportation. If there is no general contractual
agreement between the Government and a particular establishment for the
provision of these services, SCA coverage will not be asserted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Under the “commercial services” exemption, food and
lodging contracts at hotels and motels for meetings and conferences of limited
duration (one to five days) are excluded from SCA requirements if certain
criteria are met. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.123(e)(2)(i)(C); FOH 14c01(a)(4)(c).)</p>
<p>            </p>

<h3>14d06 - Management of repossessed properties.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Federal Housing
Administration (FHA), Department of Housing and Urban Development, management
contracts with real estate brokerage firms calling for the brokers to perform
services and to furnish materials and labor in connection with the management,
operation, repair, maintenance, and rental of properties repossessed by FHA,
are subject to the SCA. Typical broker contracts contain authorization to
employ a variety of service employees, including classifications such as rental
clerk, maintenance supervisor, maintenance personnel, janitor, security guard,
and pool attendant.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14d07 - Contracts with States and political
subdivisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A State or political
subdivision may obtain a Federal service contract and undertake to perform it
with State or municipal employees; for example, police, fire, or trash removal
services. The SCA does not contain an exemption for contracts performed by
State or municipal employees. Thus, the SCA will apply to contracts with States
or political subdivisions in the same manner as to contracts with private
contractors. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.110.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14d08 - Demolition, dismantling, and removal of Government property.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Property demolition, dismantling and removal contracts
which involve demolition of buildings or other structures are subject to the
SCA when their principal purpose is the furnishing of dismantling and removal
services, and no further construction at the site is contemplated (if further
construction were contemplated, the contract would be subject to the DBA), even
though the contractor may receive salvaged materials. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.116(b),
4.131(f); FOH 15d03.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  If the principal purpose of a demolition contract is
the sale of material, and services provided thereunder are incidental to the
sale, the contract would not be covered by the SCA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Asbestos or paint removal
performed as a prelude to or in conjunction with a contract for the demolition
of a public building or a public work would be subject to the SCA, if
subsequent construction on the site is not contemplated. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.131(f).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14d09 - Contracts for disaster relief.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The SCA applies to cleanup,
debris removal or damage assessment contracts awarded by a Federal agency. The
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, on behalf of the Federal Emergency Management
Administration (FEMA), awards cleanup and assessment contracts in disaster
areas. FEMA, too, may award service contracts following a disaster or in an
emergency situation.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14d10 - Contracts for scheduled or routine maintenance of building systems.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The SCA applies to contracts
for scheduled or routine maintenance of building  systems, including such
operations as filter changing, oiling and greasing, gas or fluid  replacement
or loading, and cleaning. Such contracts are generally awarded on an  annual
basis calling for scheduled maintenance or troubleshooting (inspection) checks 
throughout that year. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.117(b)(3).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14d11 - Contracts for intermittent labor services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The SCA applies to all
contracts, purchase orders, or agreements, whether written or oral, which have
as their principal purpose the furnishing of services through the use of
service employees. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.110.) An &quot;as needed&quot; agreement
with a contractor under which arrangements are made for individual calls or
orders for intermittent labor services constitutes a contract in an indefinite
amount. The individual calls or orders under this arrangement are subject to
the WD provisions of Section 2(a) of the Act. The particular form of a
contractual arrangement is immaterial, and contract amount is not determined by
the amount of any individual call. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.142(a) and (b).)<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3>14d12 - Furnishing services involving more than use of labor.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   If the principal purpose of a contract is to furnish
services through the use of service employees, the SCA will apply even though
the furnishing of non-labor items (such as tangible items to be supplied to the
Government) may be an important element in the furnishing of services called
for in the contract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.131(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Examples of covered contracts to furnish services
through the use of service employees where the furnishing of non-labor items
are an important element of the contract:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Contracts for the maintenance and
repair of typewriters that require the contractor to furnish typewriter parts
as the need arises in performing the contract services does not change the
principal purpose of the contract, which is to furnish maintenance and repair
services through the use of service employees. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.131(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Contracts to supply a Government
agency with freshly laundered items on a rental basis are covered as the
principal purposes of these contracts are to launder and deliver tangible items
through the use of service employees who launder and deliver such items. (See
29 C.F.R. 4.131(c).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Contracts for the plowing and
reseeding of a park area are covered service contracts even though the
contractor is required to rent and furnish equipment. In general contracts
under which the contractor agrees to provide the Government with vehicles or
equipment on a rental basis with drivers or operators for the purpose of
furnishing services are covered by the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.131(d).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
Contracts for data collection,
surveys, computer services and the like are covered contracts, even though the
contractor may be required to furnish tangible items such as written reports or
computer printouts, as such items are considered to be of secondary importance
to the services procured under the contract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.131(e).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5) 
Contracts for property removal or
property disposal where the contractor receives tangible items in lieu of or in
addition to monetary consideration are covered where the facts show that the
furnishing of such services is the principal purpose of the contract. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.131(f); see also FOH 14e08.) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14d13 - Services and other items to be furnished under a single contract.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The SCA applies only where a
contract as a whole is principally for the furnishing of services as opposed to
line items for specific work in a contract. The SCA reference to “bid
specification” refers to the advertised specifications in a solicitation for bids
rather than a separate line item or work requirement within a contract. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.132.) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14e00 - Government-owned – contractor operated (GOCO) prime contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A federal agency may enter
into a contract in which the prime contractor is delegated the authority to act
for and on behalf of the Federal agency (i.e., as an agent of the U.S.
Government). In such situations, if the principal purpose of the prime contract
is not the furnishing of services through the use of service employees (e.g., a
contract to totally operate or manage a Federal installation or facility or a
Federal program), then the prime contract would not be subject to the SCA. Such
contracts are commonly referred to as &quot;GOCO&quot; contracts (Government
owned-contractor operated). When such a prime contractor acting as an agent of
the Government pursuant to delegated authority enters into a subcontract, which
has services as its principal purpose, then such subcontract would be covered
by the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.107(b).) <br />
<br />
</p>

<h3>14e01 - Federally-assisted contracts for services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Service contracts entered
into by State or local public bodies with contractors are not deemed to be entered
into by the United States merely because such services are paid for with funds
received from the Federal Government as a grant under a Federal program. For
example, contracts let under the Medicaid program which are financed by
Federally-assisted grants to the States, and contracts which provide for
insurance benefits to a third party under the Medicare program, are not subject
to the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.107(b), 4.134(a).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14e02 - Medical and related services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Contracts with hospitals for patient care.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The SCA is not applicable to
contracts with hospitals for the care of patients. For example, the SCA would
not be applicable to agreements with the Social Security Administration under
which patient care services are furnished by hospitals participating in the
Medicare program. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.107(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Contracts with nursing homes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The SCA does not apply to
nursing homes solely by reason of their participation in the Medicare or
Medicaid programs. (See (a) above.) Contracts between the Veterans
Administration and nursing homes, however, are covered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Contracts for ambulance services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Generally, the SCA is not
applicable to ambulance services furnished pursuant to contracts for Medicare
or Medicaid. Federal contracts for the furnishing of ambulance services (e.g.,
VA hospitals), however, are covered by the SCA as the exemption provided by Section
7(3) of the Act does not apply. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.118.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14e03 - Job Corps facilities.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The SCA is not applied to
prime contracts entered into by the DOL with private firms for the operation of
a Job Corps facility. The SCA, however, may apply to secondary or subcontracts let
by such contractors if the principal purpose of these contracts is the
furnishing of services through the use of service employees. Such service
contracts awarded for or on behalf of the Job Corps facility by its operating
contractor will be subject to the SCA to the same extent and under the same
conditions as if they were awarded by the Government directly. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.107(b).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14e04 - Job Training Partnership Act contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The SCA is not applicable to contracts which provide
for the training and teaching of vocational skills to the disadvantaged, such
as those operated in connection with the Job Training Partnership Act (which
replaced the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA)) or other DOL ETA
programs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Where a contractor providing training under such a
program also enters into a contract with a Government agency for the furnishing
of services, e.g., janitorial, any trainees who are performing the services
called for in the service contract are subject to the SCA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14e05 - Contracts with the National Guard.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Contracts for the operation and maintenance of State
National Guard training and logistical facilities are generally not subject to
the SCA. While the National Guard Bureau provides full or partial funding for
these contracts, services are provided directly to the States and not to the
U.S. Government. The States independently obtain services to support training
and logistical facilities for each State National Guard unit. Contracts are
signed by State officials and are administered by the individual States
according to State contracting procedures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Contracts entered into between the National Guard
Bureau, DOD, and State National Guard units that provide for the acquisition of
services for the direct benefit or use of the National Guard Bureau and signed
by a U.S. Property and Fiscal Officer would be subject to the SCA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14e06 - Contracts between a Federal or District of Columbia agency and
another such agency.</h3>
<p>                                                            </p>
<p>Prime contracts between a
Federal or District of Columbia agency and another such agency are not subject
to the SCA. “Subcontracts” awarded under “prime contracts” between the Small
Business Administration and another Federal agency pursuant to various small
business/minority set-aside programs, such as the “section 8(a)” program, are
covered by the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.110.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14e07 - Government contracts whose principal purposes are something other
than services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Contracts for lease of building space for Government
occupancy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where the Government
contracts for a lease of building space for occupancy and the building owner
furnishes general janitorial and other building services on an incidental basis
through the use of service employees, the leasing of the space rather than the
furnishing of building services is the principal purpose of the contract, and the
SCA would not apply. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.134(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Contracts for the rental of parking space.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This type of contract is
outside the coverage of the SCA as the Government agency is simply given a
lease or license to use the contractor’s real property. Such a contract can be
distinguished from contracts for storage of vehicles which are delivered into
the possession or custody of the contractor, who will provide the required
services including the parking or retrieval of the vehicles. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.134(b).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14e08 - Federal timber sales contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Timber sales contracts generally are not subject to
the SCA because the services normally provided under such contracts are
considered incidental to the principal purpose of the contract, i.e., the sale
of timber. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.131(f).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The SCA would apply to service contracts that are
principally for some purpose other than the sale of timber; e.g., the clearing
of land to open up the forest for public use, or the removal of diseased or
dead trees.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14e09 - Storage and/or sale of surplus farm commodities.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Department of Agriculture
contracts or agreements (usually designated as “Uniform (commodity name)
Storage Agreement”) awarded by or on behalf of the Commodity Credit Corporation
(CCC) pursuant to various price support programs for the storage, handling,
and/or sale of surplus farm commodities, including grain, cotton, tobacco,
seeds, naval stores, dairy products, etc., by commercial warehouse
establishments, are exempt from the PCA (see Section 12 of R &amp; I No. 3),
and a CWHSSA exemption has been granted for most of these contracts. (see 29
C.F.R. 5.15(b)(2).) WH has taken no position on the application of the SCA to
such contracts.</p>
<p>                         </p>

<h3>14f00 - Airplane and rotorcraft pilots and copilots.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Pilots and copilots are
“service employees” within the meaning of the SCA and “laborers and mechanics”
within the meaning of the CWHSSA when they are performing in that capacity on
covered contracts. While the work of a pilot requires dexterity, coordination,
a degree of physical strength and other physical and mental processes necessary
to control an airplane or rotorcraft in flight, such work does not meet the
primary duty requirement for exemption as a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional employee. (See 29 C.F.R. 5.15(d)(3) for the
variation from the CWHSSA OT requirements for pilots and co-pilots performing
on contracts for firefighting or suppression and related services.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14f01 - Employees performing grooming services under concessionaire
contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees performing work
involving the grooming of people under concessionaire contracts for such
services entered into with nonappropriated fund instrumentalities of the United
States are “service employees” under the SCA. This includes, among others,
barbers, shoe-shiners, beauticians, and manicurists. (See FOH 14d00.) (Such
employees are also “laborers and mechanics” for purposes of the CWHSSA.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14f02 - Flight instructors - contracts for flight training.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Flight instructors, who
qualify for exemption as teachers under FLSA 29 C.F.R. 541.303, are not
“service employees” for purposes of the SCA. (See FOH Chapter 22)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14f03 - Air traffic control instructors.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>To be “teachers” and
consequently exempt from coverage under the SCA pursuant to Section 8(b) of the
Act as a professionally exempt teacher under the FLSA, air traffic control
instructors must be FAA “Certified Professional Controllers” in accordance with
Regulations 14 C.F.R. Part 65, must successfully complete the FAA “Facility
Instructor Training Course” furnished by the FAA Academy, and must, as their
primary duty, deliver instruction by using FAA-certified curriculum in classes
and laboratories funded by the FAA. (See FLSA 29 C.F.R. 541.303; SCA 29 C.F.R.
4.113(a)(2) - (3); Opinion letter dated 6-2-04 to FAA.) </p>
<p>             </p>

<h3>14f04   Computer-related occupations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Computer systems analysts,
computer programmers, software engineers or other similarly skilled workers in
the computer field who qualify for exemption under 29 C.F.R. 541.400 would not
be “service employees” for purposes of the SCA. (See 29 U.S.C. 213(a)(1) and 13
(a)(17); FOH Chapter 22)                                                  </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14g00 - Segregation: SCA-covered and non-covered work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If a contractor desires to
segregate covered work from non-covered work under the SCA for purposes of
applying the SCA WD, the contractor must identify such covered work accurately
in the records or by other means. In this regard, an arbitrary assignment of
time on the basis of a formula, as between covered and non-covered work, is not
sufficient. However, if the contractor does not wish to keep detailed
hour-by-hour records for segregation purposes under the SCA, records can be
segregated on the wider basis of departments, work shifts, days, or weeks in
which covered work was performed. For example, if on a given day no Government
work was performed by a laundry under its contract, this day can be segregated
and shown in the records. Similarly, if on a given day only noontime meals were
provided by a restaurant under a covered contract to furnish meals to military
personnel, employment on the night shift could be segregated. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.169, 4.179.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14g01 - Segregation: employees performing work in more than one
classification.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   If an employee performs work which can be clearly
identified and segregated under more than one job classification listed in the
applicable WD, i.e., working in different capacities in the performance of the
contract, then the time spent by the employee in work properly related to each classification
should be segregated and paid according to the wage rate specified for each
classification. If the contractor cannot provide affirmative proof (employer
records) of the hours spent in each class of work, then the contractor must pay
the employee the highest of such rates for all hours worked in the workweek.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.169.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Working in “different capacities” applies only to work
in different job classifications (e.g., janitors and window cleaners as defined
in the SCA Directory of Occupations), not to levels within the same job
classification (e.g., security guards I and II as defined in the SCA Directory
of Occupations). Thus, for example, segregating work performed by an employee
as security guard I and II would not be permitted. In such a situation, the
employee must be paid the highest rate listed in the WD for security guards
(i.e., security guard II rate) for all hours worked in the workweek on the
covered contract.</p>
<p>                        </p>

<h3>14g02 - Security guard services - compensability of training time.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Where a covered contract dictates that persons are
required to complete certain training before performing on the contract as
security guards, such persons are considered employees of the contractor while
undergoing such training and time spent in training is compensable hours worked
as described below. Whether this training is of limited application or more
general in nature (e.g., State-mandated training courses), it cannot be
considered “voluntary” within the meaning of the FLSA 29 C.F.R. 785.27, since
the contractor is obligated to provide employees in order to meet the
stipulations in the contract which require the training. Likewise, time spent
in training that is specifically required by a covered contract is compensable
hours worked even if the training is performed prior to formal contract award
or the trainee subsequently is not hired as a contract security guard. The
training time for such employees would be compensable work time, but not at the
compensation level provided in the applicable WD as the contract services for
which wage rates and fringe benefits are specified in the applicable WD are not
being performed. The contractor must pay wages for this training time at rates
not less than the MW specified under Section 6(a)(1) of the FLSA and Section
2(b)(1) of the SCA, unless otherwise specified in the applicable WD. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.146) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Time spent in on-the-job training (i.e., after start
of contract performance at the job site) must be paid for at not less than the
SCA MW/FB specified for the guard classification listed in the WD included in
the contract. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14g03 - Mail haul contracts hours worked issues.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The basic principles for determining hours worked by a
truck driver on duty for 24 hours or more as set forth in FOH 31b09 and 31b12
are applicable to SCA mail haul truck drivers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Time during which an employee is considered on or off
duty by the Department of Transportation is not governed by the same principles
as apply under the FLSA. The DOT’s regulations are concerned primarily with the
safe operation of the vehicle and not compensable hours worked. Thus, the off-duty
time required by DOT for safety purposes may exceed the amount of sleep time or
other non-working time that may be deducted pursuant to FOH 31b09 or 31b12.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The principles set forth in FLSA 29 C.F.R. 785.14
through 785.22 must be applied to determine whether layover or breakdown time
is hours worked. Where such time is compensable hours worked and occurs on an
SCA contract, it must be paid at a rate not less than the applicable SCA WD
rate for drivers since such time is intrinsically related to contract work. If
a contractor chooses to pay for layover and breakdown time, which would
otherwise not be considered hours worked under FLSA 29 C.F.R. 785, for the
purpose of not breaking a driver’s continuous tour of duty on tours of 24 hours
or more, then such time must also be paid at the applicable SCA WD rate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  WH considers the totality of the circumstances in
determining whether layover or breakdown time is hours worked. Small remote
towns with few amenities often do not provide an opportunity for an employee to
use the time effectively for his own purposes. In such cases, the layover or
breakdown time would be considered hours worked and compensation must be no
less than the SCA WD rate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Overtime exemption applicable to mail haul contracts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Section 13(b)(1) of the FLSA
provides an overtime exemption for employees who are within the authority of
the Secretary of Transportation to establish qualifications and maximum hours
of service pursuant to Section 204 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935. On June
14, 1972, the Department of Transportation published a notice in the Federal
Register (37 Fed. Reg. 11781) asserting its power to establish qualifications
and maximum hours of service for contract mail haulers who operate in
interstate or foreign commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The FLSA’s § 13(b)(1)
exemption may therefore apply to certain employees of contract mail haulers,
provided the tests for that exemption are met. See 29 C.F.R. § 782.8(b). Note,
however, that drivers, driver’s helpers, loaders, and mechanics, whose duties
affect the safety of operation of a vehicle engaged in transportation on public
highways in interstate or foreign commerce and who would otherwise satisfy the
exemption, are nonetheless required to be paid overtime compensation if the
vehicle used for mail haul purposes weighs 10,000 pounds or less. This is known
as the “small vehicle exception” to the motor carrier exemption. The small
vehicle exception applies and overtime pay is due to an employee in any
workweek when the employee’s work, “in whole or in part,” affects the safety of
operation of a small vehicle. The phrase “in whole or in part” means an
employee who performs such duties involving small vehicles for the entire week
or part of the week must receive overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in that
workweek.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note that the small vehicle exception
will not apply to certain vehicles A) designed or used to transport more than 8
passengers (including driver) for compensation, B) designed or used to
transport more than 15 passengers (including driver) and not used to transport
passengers for compensation, or C) used in transporting hazardous material
requiring placarding under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of
Transportation. See Fact Sheet #19 and FAB 2010-2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   In addition, the CWHSSA exempts all Federal contracts
&quot;for transportation by land, air or water&quot; from its provisions for
overtime pay. The overtime provisions of this statute would also not apply to
employees working on USPS mail hauling contracts. (See 40 U.S.C. 3701(b)(3);
FOH 15i00(2) &amp; 15i01(c).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Applicable wage rate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The wage rate applicable to
mail haul truck drivers is based upon the point of origin of the route required
by the contract. This point of origin is commonly referred to as the “head out”
point. The “head out” rate is applicable to all drivers who work on the
contract regardless of where they may start their portion of the route. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14g04 - Cost of furnishing and maintaining uniforms.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees performing on most SCA food service,
security guard service, nursing home service, and janitorial service contracts
are required by the employer, by the employer’s Government contract, by law, or
by the nature of the work, to wear clean uniforms and/or related apparel or
equipment. In such situations, the financial cost of furnishing and maintaining
(except in the case of wash and wear uniforms, see (d) below) clean uniforms or
equipment is considered to be a business expense of the employer and may not be
imposed upon the employees if to do so would reduce their wages below the FLSA
MW or SCA prevailing wage rate (or FLSA or CWHSSA OT). Where the MW (or OT) is
diminished below the required rate, the employer must bear the cost of
providing clean uniforms and equipment up to the amount of any such deficiency.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.168(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  A determination of the cost of furnishing the uniforms
(and related equipment) itself presents no problem. If the employee is required
to furnish the uniform, the actual cost incurred by the employee shall be used
to ascertain whether a MW or OT violation has occurred. The same is true where
a commercial laundry or uniform rental services is utilized. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.168(b); FOH 30c12.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Where uniform cleaning and maintenance is the
responsibility of the employee, a contractor may satisfy its wage obligation
under the Act by reimbursing employees $3.35/wk or $.67/day for such cleaning
and maintenance. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.168(b)(1)(ii).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  There generally is no requirement that employees be
reimbursed where the uniforms furnished are made of “wash and wear” materials
which may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments and
require no special treatment such as daily washing, dry cleaning or commercial
laundering. This limitation does not apply, however, where a different
provision has been set forth in the applicable WD. In the case of WDs issued
under Section 4(c) of the Act for successor contracts, the amount established
by the parties to the predecessor CBA is deemed to be the cost of laundering
uniforms. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.168(b)(2).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14g05 - Military base installation contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Operations and maintenance
contracts let by the military whose principal purpose is to provide services
may be subject to both the SCA and the DBA where there are substantial and
segregable amounts of construction. When it is unclear whether the work
required is SCA maintenance or DBA repair/painting, and where individual work
orders have repair work that requires less than 32 hours to complete or
painting of less than 200 square feet, WH will consider such work to be subject
to the SCA. Work orders that exceed these amounts are subject to the DBA. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14g06 - Military housing privatization.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Maintenance services
performed on military housing constructed or managed under the Military Housing
Privatization Initiative is not subject to the SCA as the contract is not
principally for services. (See Administrator Letter dated December 20, 2006.) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14h00 - SCA Wage Determinations (WDs).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The SCA WD sets forth the MWs and FBs that contractors
and their subcontractors must pay service employees working on covered
contracts. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.3(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Wages are defined as monetary
compensation provided to employees. They are usually listed in the WD as hourly
rates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The FBs specified in the WD depend
upon the type of WD issued and the evaluation of source data used to develop
the WD. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Most WDs are revised periodically, as new wage and
benefit survey data become available. If a WD is properly included in the
contract at the time of award, the contract does not need to be modified to
include subsequent revisions to the WD prior to completion of the first year of
the contract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.5(a)(2).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Section 10 of the Act requires a WD to be made by WH
for every covered service contract in excess of $2,500 and employing six or
more service employees. If five or fewer service employees are employed under a
contract, the contracting agency should obtain a WD, and if one is available,
incorporate it into the contract. WH is not required by the Act to issue a WD
for covered contracts that exceed $2,500 with five or fewer service employees,
but the contracting agency should still seek to obtain one. In instances where
no WD has been issued for a service contract involving five or fewer service
employees, the contractor can pay no less than the MW required by Section
6(a)(1) of the FLSA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.2, 4.3(a), 4.4(b)(1).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Two Bases on which SCA WDs are issued:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Prevailing in the locality WDs set
forth MWs and FBs determined to be prevailing for various classes of service
employees in the locality of the service contract after giving “due
consideration” to the rates applicable to such service employees if directly
hired by the Government. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.51.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     Rates are usually based on data collected by the BLS
under the National Compensation and Occupational Employment Statistics Surveys;
or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     Rates may be based on union dominance where a single
rate is paid to a majority (50 percent or more) of workers in a class of
service employees engaged in similar work in a particular locality. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.51(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Section 4(c), or “successorship”,
WDs set forth the wages and benefits, including accrued and prospective
increases, contained in CBAs reached as a result of arm’s-length negotiations
that were applicable to service employees employed on predecessor contracts in
the same locality. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     For Section 4(c) to be applicable, the predecessor
contract must involve substantially the same services being provided in the
same locality. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(i).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     The successor contractor is obligated to pay its
service employees the CBA rates whether or not the employees of the predecessor
contractor are hired by the successor contractor. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     The provisions of Section 4(c) are self-executing and
failure to include the CBA rates in the WD issued for the successor contract
does not relieve a successor contractor of the statutory requirements to comply
with the CBA rates. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
d.     Any interpretation of the wage and FB provisions of
the CBA where its provisions are unclear must be based on the intent of the
parties to the CBA provided that such interpretation is not violative of law.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(j).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
e.     The obligation of the successor contractor is limited
to the wage and benefit requirements of the predecessor contractor’s CBA and
does not extend to other items such as seniority, grievance procedures, work
rules, overtime, etc. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
f.     The successor contractor may satisfy the FB provisions
of the CBA by furnishing any equivalent combination of benefits or by making
equivalent or differential payments in cash in accordance with 29 C.F.R. 4.177.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(j).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
g.     Application of Section 4(c) is not negated because the
contracting authority may change and the successor contract is awarded by a
different contracting agency. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(g).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
h.     The successorship provisions of Section 4(c) apply to
full term successor contracts. “Bridge” or short-term interim contracts due to
bid protest, default by the predecessor contractor, temporary closing of
facility, etc., are not predecessor contracts for Section 4(c) purposes and do
not negate the application of Section 4(c)’s successorship provisions to the
full term contract awarded after the temporary interruption or hiatus.
Contractors are required to pay the predecessor contractor’s CBA rates during
short-term interim contracts. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(h).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                              
i.     Under Section 4(c), the predecessor contractor’s
existing CBA provides the basis for the WD applicable to the successor
contract. If the CBA is no longer binding on the parties, e.g., as a result of
union decertification or a legitimate impasse recognized by the National Labor
Relations Act, the successorship requirements of Section 4(c) would be broken.
The CBA rates would not apply to the successor contract, but would continue to
apply throughout the contract period during which the decertification or
impasse was reached. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                              
j.     Pursuant to Section 4(b) of the SCA, a variation limits
the self-executing application of Section 4(c) for new and changed CBAs entered
into by the incumbent contractor such that a new or changed CBA is not
effective for successorship purposes if: (1) in the case of a successor
contract for which bids have been invited by formal advertising, notice of the
terms of the new or changed CBA is received by the contracting agency less than
10 days before the date set for bid opening (provided that the contracting
agency finds that there is not reasonable time still available to notify
bidders), or (2) for awards of successor contracts to be entered into pursuant
to negotiations or resulting from execution of a renewal option or extension,
notice of the terms of the new or changed CBA is received by the contracting
agency after the award of the successor contract, and the start of contract performance
is within 30 days of the award, renewal option, or extension (however, if the
contract does not specify a start of performance date within 30 days from the
award, and/or performance of such procurement does not begin within this 30-day
period, any notice of the terms of the new or changed CBA received by the
contracting agency not less than 10 days before commencement of the contract
will be effective for purposes of the successor contract under Section 4(c)). This
variation will apply only if the contracting agency has given both the
incumbent contractor and its employees’ collective bargaining representative
written notification at least 30 days in advance of applicable estimated
procurement dates. Estimated procurement dates include bid solicitation, bid
opening, date of award, commencement of negotiations, receipt of proposals, or
the commencement date of a contract resulting from a negotiation, option, or
extension, as the case may be. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.1b(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
k.     There are two types of appeals that can be made
concerning collectively bargained rates where Section 4(c) applies -- based on
substantial variance issues, or based on issues concerning arm’s-length
negotiations. Both types of appeals are resolved based on administrative proceedings
handled by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Part 6, and/or
the Administrative Review Board (ARB) pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Part 8. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.10, 4.11, 4.163(c).) </p>
<h4> </h4>

<h3>14h01 - Obtaining SCA Wage Determinations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>WDs can be obtained from the
wdol.gov website (http://www.wdol.gov) by the agency in two different ways. The
agency has total discretion as to the method it will follow. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   “e98” process. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.4(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
The e98 is an electronic
application on the WDOL.gov website that contracting agencies may use to
request WDs directly from DOL WH. The submission of an e98 requires the same
general information as required by the SF 98.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
After a WD is sent to the agency,
the e98 system continues to monitor the request and if the applicable WD is
revised in time to affect the procurement, an amended response will be sent to
the email address identified on the e98.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
If the bid opening date for
invitations to bid (IFB), or if contract commencement for all other contract
actions, is delayed by more than sixty (60) days the contracting agency must
submit a revised e98. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  WDOL process. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.4(c).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Agencies may use the WDOL website
to select the proper WD for the procurement. The WDOL website provides
assistance to the contracting agency in the selection of the correct WD. The
contracting agency is fully responsible for selecting the correct WD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Where the incumbent contractor
furnishes services through the use of service employees whose wages and
benefits are the subject of one or more CBA(s), the contracting agency may
prepare a WD referencing and incorporating a complete copy of the CBA into the
successor contract action.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
The contracting agency shall
monitor the WDOL website to determine whether the applicable WD has been
revised. Revisions published on the WDOL site or otherwise communicated to the
contracting officer are applicable and to be included in the contract if
published or communicated within the following timeframes:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     For advertised procurement - 10 days or more before
the date set for bid opening;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     For negotiated procurement - before the award date if
start of performance is within 30 days of the award, or 10 or more days before
commencement of the contract if the contract does not specify a start of
performance date within 30 days from the award and/or performance of such
procurement does not commence within this 30-day period. (See also 29 C.F.R.
4.5(a)(2).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
If WH determines that the
contracting agency failed to incorporate the SCA stipulations and WD into the
contract, or inserted an incorrect WD to a specific contract, the contracting
agency within 30 days of notice from WH, will amend the contract to incorporate
the SCA stipulations and/or correct WD as determined by WH. (See 29 C.F.R. §
4.5(c)(1).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5) 
If a prevailing WD is not
available on the WDOL website, the contracting agency must submit an e98.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14h02 - Conformability of classifications/wage rates.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   “Conformance” is the method used to establish wage
rates for classes of service employees to be employed on a covered service
contract that are not listed on the WD included in the contract (i.e., the work
to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the WD). (See
29 C.F.R. § 4.6(b)(2).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Contractors should conform wage
rates for any unlisted class of service employee before such an employee
performs any contract work and classify unlisted classes in a manner that
provides a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill
comparison) between the unlisted class and the classes listed in the WD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Conformed wage rates must be paid
to all employees in the affected class retroactive to the date such employees
commenced any contract work. Such rates are treated as if the rates and classes
had been included on the original WD issued for the contract. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.6(b)(2)(v).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Conformances may not be used to
artificially subdivide classes already listed in the WD. For example, a stock
clerk as defined in the “SCA Directory of Occupations” is the same job in terms
of knowledge, skills, and duties as the shelf stocker and store worker II. If a
stock clerk was listed in the WD, a conformance cannot be based on splitting
the job into two jobs and establishing a hybrid classification, e.g., shelf
stocker and stock clerk II. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
Where WDs list a series of levels
within a job classification family, e.g., Engineering Technicians I through VI,
the lowest level listed for a job classification family is considered to be the
entry level and establishment of a lower level through conformance is not
permissible. A conformance cannot establish a job level below the entry level
listed in the WD. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5) 
Trainee classifications cannot be
conformed. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6) 
Helper classifications in skilled
maintenance trades (e.g., electricians, machinists, automobile mechanics, etc.)
cannot be conformed. Helper classifications in skilled maintenance trades whose
duties constitute separate and distinct jobs may be used if listed in the WD.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Conformance Procedures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
The contractor is required to
provide a written report of a proposed conformance, including information as to
whether the employees involved or their authorized representative agree or
disagree with the conformed wage rates and FBs, to the contracting officer no
later than 30 days after such unlisted class begins to perform work on the
contract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(ii).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The contracting officer, after
reviewing the proposed conformance, is required to submit a report that
includes the agency’s recommendation to the NO/Division of Wage Determinations/Branch
of Service Contract Wage Determinations for review. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.6(b)(2)(ii).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
The Branch will approve, modify or
disapprove the proposed conformance or render a final determination within 30
days of receipt of the report or will notify the contracting agency that
additional time is necessary to review the report. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.6(b)(2)(ii).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
The Branch will transmit the final
determination to the contracting officer who is to promptly notify the
contractor of the action taken. The contractor is required to furnish each
affected employee with a copy of the conformance determination or post it at
the job site as part of the WD. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(iii).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5) 
If the contracting agency does not
agree to submit a conformance, the WHD may initiate action pursuant to 29
C.F.R. § 4.6(b)(2)(vi) for a final determination of a proper conformed
classification, wage rate and/or FBs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6) 
In the case of a contract
modification, an exercise of an option or extension of an existing contract,
the conformance procedures provide an “indexing procedure” for previously
conformed classifications. A contractor can increase a previously conformed
rate by the average percentage increase between the rates listed in the current
WD for all classifications to be used on the contract and those rates specified
for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable WD without
obtaining WH approval or agreement by the employees involved, but must notify
the contracting officer. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(iv)(B).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14i00 - Wage payments to employees – general.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Monetary wages specified under the SCA must be paid to
employees promptly and in no event later than one pay period following the end
of the regular pay period in which such wages were earned or accrued. A pay
period under the SCA may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly. (See
29 C.F.R. 4.6(h), 4.165(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Wages due service employees must be paid “free and
clear” and without subsequent rebate, or kickback on any account, except
deductions permitted by law. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.165-4.168.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The Act makes no distinction, with respect to its
compensation provisions, between temporary, part-time, and full-time employees,
and the WD MW and FB apply, in the absence of an express limitation, equally to
such service employees engaged in work covered by the SCA. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.165(a)(2), 4.176(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  If participation in a FB plan requires a contribution
from the employee’s wages, whether through payroll deduction or otherwise, the
employee’s concurrence is necessary before such payroll deduction can be made.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.168(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   A contractor cannot offset an amount of FBs paid in
excess of the FBs required under a WD in order to satisfy its MW obligations,
and vice versa. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.167, 4.170(a), 4.177(a)(1).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14i01 - Tipped employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Tips may generally be included in wages of employees
working on SCA contracts (such as at military post barbershops, etc.) in
accordance with Section 3(m) of the FLSA and 29 C.F.R. Part 531. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.6(q), 4.167; FOH 30d.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Although the current tip credit provided under the
FLSA requires a cash payment of no less than $2.13, the tip credit taken by an
SCA contractor is limited to $1.34 per hour. In no event shall the sum credited
be in excess of the value of tips actually received by the employee. The requirements
for successor contractors under Section 4(c) are different and are described in
(c) below. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.167.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Where Section 4(c) of the SCA applies, the use of FLSA
Section 3(m) tip credit must have been permitted under the terms of the predecessor’s
CBA in order for it to be utilized by the successor in satisfying the SCA MW
obligations. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(k).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14i02 - SCA contractors and FLSA Exemptions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In some cases, a covered
service contract may be awarded to an establishment whose employees otherwise
would be exempt from the MW provisions of the FLSA pursuant to § 13(a). The
FLSA at § 6(e)(1) negates the exemption provisions of FLSA § 13 (except §§
13(a)(1) and 13(f)) and requires payment of the FLSA MW to all of a service
contractor’s employees whose pay is not governed by the SCA or to whom FLSA § 13(a)(1)
does not apply. (See FOH 30e.)</p>

<h3>14j00 - General provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The FBs that an employer is required to furnish
employees performing on a covered contract will be specified in the applicable
WD included in the contract documents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Any administrative costs (e.g.,
recordkeeping costs associated with payroll administration) incurred by a
contractor directly in providing FB plans are considered business expenses of
the firm and not contributions made on behalf of the employees. Such
administrative costs cannot be credited toward meeting the FB obligations of the
applicable WD. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.172.) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The cost incurred by a Government
contractor’s insurance carrier (or third party trust fund) in its
administration and delivery of benefits to service employees can be credited
toward the contractor’s FB obligations under an SCA WD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  FB obligations may be discharged by furnishing any
equivalent combination of cash or bona fide FBs. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.170, 4.177.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The terms “equivalent fringe benefit” and “cash
equivalent” mean equal in terms of monetary cost to the contractor. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.177(a)(3).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  It is the contractor’s responsibility to satisfy the
FB obligations set forth in an SCA WD. The contractor may choose the FBs to be
provided, whether an employee accepts or refuses the FBs offered. If an
employee desires cash payments or benefits other than those chosen by the
contractor, that would be a matter for discussion and resolution between the
employee and the employer. If the contractor furnished a lesser amount of the
FBs called for by the applicable WD, the contractor must furnish the employee
with the difference between the amount stated in the WD and the actual cost of
the FB which the contractor provided. As set forth in 29 C.F.R. 4.175(a)(2),
the contractor may make up the difference in cash to the employee, or furnish
equivalent benefits, or a combination thereof. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.177.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   If participation in the FB plan requires a
contribution from the employee’s wages, whether through payroll deduction or
otherwise, the employee’s concurrence is necessary. No contribution toward FBs
made by employees, or deducted from their wages, may be included or used by an
employer in satisfying any part of any FB obligation under the Act. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.168(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Service employees employed by a single employer are
entitled to FB payments only up to a maximum of 40 hours per week, regardless
of the number of contracts on which they work, unless otherwise specified by
the applicable WD. This position only affects covered contracts subject to
“prevailing” WDs with the “fixed cost” per employee H&amp;W, paid vacation and
holiday benefits. Service employees who work for a single employer on multiple
contracts which may have other requirements, such as a collectively bargained
FB or an “average cost” H&amp;W FB, may be entitled to FB payments in excess of
40 hours per week. (See Dantran, Inc. v. U.S. DOL, 171 F.3d 58 (1st Cir.
1999).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   The FB requirements under successor contracts subject
to SCA Section 4(c) are included in 29 C.F.R. 4.163. Terms of the CBA will
dictate eligibility requirements, and the amount and extent of such FBs. Since
a successor contractor’s obligations are governed by the terms of the CBA, any
interpretation of the wage and FB provisions of the CBA where they are unclear
must be based on the intent of the parties, provided that such interpretation
does not violate the law. Some of the principles discussed in the regulations
regarding specific interpretations of the FB provisions of prevailing WDs may
not be applicable to WDs issued pursuant to Section 4(c). The provisions of Section
4(c), however, do not supersede the provision of Section 2(a)(2) of the Act
that allows a contractor to satisfy its FB obligations by furnishing any
equivalent combinations of FBs or by making equivalent or differential payments
in cash. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(j), 4.177.) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14j01 - “Bona fide” FB plans.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   To be considered “bona fide” for SCA purposes, a FB
plan, fund, or program must constitute a legally enforceable obligation which
meets certain criteria. The plan, fund, or program must be compliant with the
Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), laws and regulations
enforced by the IRS, and State insurance laws, and contributions must be made
irrevocably to a trustee or third person pursuant to an insurance agreement,
trust, or other funded arrangement. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.171(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The primary purpose of a FB plan under the SCA must be
to provide systematically for the payment of benefits to employees on account
of death, disability, advanced age, retirement, illness, medical expenses,
hospitalization, supplemental employment benefits, and the like. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.171(a)(2).) While not specifically enumerated in the regulations,
supplemental unemployment plans and prepaid legal plans are considered “bona
fide” FBs for purposes of the Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Unfunded, self-insured FB plans under which a
contractor allegedly makes “out of pocket” payments to provide benefits for
employees as costs are incurred, rather than making irrevocable contributions
to a trust or other funded arrangements, are not normally considered “bona
fide” plans or equivalent benefits except for plans to provide paid vacation
and holiday FBs. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.171(b)(1).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Under certain conditions, a
contractor may request approval by the Administrator of an unfunded
self-insured plan in order to allow credit for payments under such a plan in
meeting the FB requirements of the Act. The purpose of seeking advance approval
is to avoid situations involving unfunded plans where monies allegedly
allocated by a contractor to provide FBs are used for other purposes or are
recouped without actually furnishing any benefits. This procedure is not
intended to prohibit self-insured plans where irrevocable payments are made
pursuant to a trust or other funded arrangement and other conditions are met.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.171(b)(2).)<a name="OLE_LINK1"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
“Stop loss” insurance payments
that provide coverage in the event that claims paid from an unfunded
self-insured plan exceed specified limits both in the individual and the
aggregate can be credited against the FB obligations of the applicable WD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Contractors may not take credit for any benefit
required by Federal, State, or local law such as workers’ compensation,
unemployment compensation, and Social Security contributions. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.171(c).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   The furnishing of facilities which are primarily for
the benefit or convenience of the contractor or the cost of which is properly a
business expense of the contractor is not the furnishing of a “bona fide” FB or
equivalent benefit or the payment of wages; e.g., items such as relocation expenses,
travel and transportation expenses incident to employment, incentive or
suggestion awards, etc. Also, a contractor cannot take credit toward its MW and
FB obligations for the cost of providing social functions or parties for
employees, flowers, cards, or gifts on employee birthdays, anniversaries, etc.
(sunshine funds), employee rest or recreation rooms, paid coffee breaks,
magazine subscriptions, and professional or club dues. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.171(d)-(f).)</p>
<p>            </p>

<h3>14j02 - Crediting of FB payments.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The FBs specified in the WD
must be furnished separate from and in addition to the specified MWs to the
employees engaged in the performance of the contract. A contractor may not
offset an amount of monetary wages paid in excess of the MWs required under the
WD in order to satisfy its FB obligations, and must keep appropriate records
separately showing amounts paid for wages or furnished for FBs. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.167, 4.170(a).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14j03 - Vacation pay.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   General.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eligibility for vacation
benefits specified in a prevailing WD is based on completion of a standard
period of past service. The principles to be followed in determining an
employee’s length of service for vacation eligibility are summarized below.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.173.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Determining length of service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most prevailing WDs require
an employer to furnish employees a specified amount of paid vacation upon
completion of a specific length of service with a contractor or successor;
e.g., “one week paid vacation after one year of service with a contractor or
successor” or “one week’s paid vacation after one year of service.” Unless
specified otherwise in an applicable WD, the following two factors must be
taken into consideration in determining when an employee has completed the
required length of service to be eligible for vacation benefits:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
The total length of time spent by
an employee in the continuous service of the present (successor) contractor,
including both the time spent performing commercial work and the time spent
performing on the Government contract(s) itself. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.173(a)(1)(i).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Where applicable, the total length
of time spent in any capacity as an employee in the continuous service of any
predecessor contractor(s) who carried out similar contract functions at the
same Federal facility. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(a)(1)(ii).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, prior service as a
Federal employee is not counted toward an employee’s eligibility for vacation
benefits under the applicable WD. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(a)(3).) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Eligibility requirement - continuous service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Under the principles set
forth above, if an employee’s total length of service adds up to at least one
year, the employee is eligible for the specified amount of vacation with pay
provided in the WD. The term “continuous service” does not require the
combination of two entirely separate periods of employment where there has been
a break in service. Whether or not there is a break in the continuity of
service so as to make an employee ineligible for a vacation benefit is
dependent upon all the facts in the particular case. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Accrual or vesting and payment of vacation benefits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where a prevailing WD
specifies “one week paid vacation after one year of service with a contractor
or successor,” an employee who renders the “one year of service” continuously
becomes eligible for the “one week paid vacation” (i.e., 40 hours of paid
vacation, unless otherwise specified in an applicable WD) upon his/her
anniversary date of employment and upon each succeeding anniversary date
thereafter. There is no accrual or vesting of vacation eligibility before the
employee’s anniversary date of employment, and no segment of time smaller than
one year need be considered in computing the employer’s vacation liability,
unless otherwise specifically provided for in a particular WD. The vacation
benefits need not be provided by the employer on the date of vesting. However,
the required benefit must be furnished before the employee’s next anniversary
date, before the current contract is completed, or before the employee
terminates employment, whichever occurs first. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(c)(2).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Contractor liability for vacation benefits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The liability for an
employee’s vacation is not prorated among contractors unless specifically
provided for in a particular WD. The contractor by whom a person is employed at
the time the vacation right vests, i.e., on the employee’s anniversary date of
employment, must provide the full benefit required by the applicable WD on that
date before the employee’s next anniversary date, before the current contract
is completed, or before the employee terminates employment, whichever occurs
first. Thus, vacation benefits must be complied with in full on an annual
basis. Any unused vacation benefits may not be “carried over” from year to
year. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(c)-(d).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Certified listing of employee anniversary dates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the case of a contract
performed at a Federal facility where employees may be retained by a succeeding
contractor, 29 C.F.R. 4.6(1)(2) provides that the incumbent prime contractor
must furnish a certified list of all service employees on the contractor’s or
subcontractor’s payroll during the last month of the contract, together with
the anniversary dates of employment (with the incumbent as well as predecessor contractors)
of each such employee, to the contracting officer not less than 10 days before
contract completion. A copy of this list is to be provided to the successor
contractor for determining employee eligibility for vacation FBs which are
based on length of service with predecessor contractors (where such benefit is
required by an applicable WD). Failure to obtain such employment data does not
relieve a contractor from any obligation to provide vacation benefits. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.173(d)(2).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Rate applicable to computation of vacation benefits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The rate applicable to the
computation of vacation benefits is the applicable WD rate or employee’s
regular rate of pay, whichever is higher, at the time the vacation benefit is
provided or a cash equivalent is paid. If an applicable WD requires that the
hourly wage rate be increased during the period of the contract, the rate
applicable to the computation of any required vacation benefits is the hourly
rate in effect in the w/w in which the actual paid vacation is provided or the
equivalent is paid, as the case may be, and would not be the average of two
hourly rates. This rule would not apply to situations where a WD specified a
different method of computation and the rate to be used. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.173(e)(1).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)  Cash equivalent for vacation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where an employer elects to
pay an hourly cash equivalent in lieu of a paid vacation, which is computed in
accordance with 29 C.F.R. 4.177(c)(5), such payments need commence only after
the employee has satisfied the “after one year of service” requirement (in
cases where there is such an eligibility requirement). However, should the
employee terminate employment for any reason before receiving the full amount
of vested vacation benefits due, the employee must be paid the full amount of
any difference remaining as a final cash payment. The rate applicable to the
computation of cash equivalents for vacation benefits is the hourly wage rate
in effect at the time such equivalent payments are actually made. (See 29
C.F.R. 4.173(c)(1) and (e)(1).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14j04 - Holiday pay.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Most prevailing WDs list a specific number of named
holidays for which payment is required. A full-time employee who is eligible to
receive payment for a named holiday must receive a full day’s pay up to 8 hours
unless a different standard is used in the WD, such as one reflecting CBA
benefit requirements. A full-time employee who works on the day designated as a
holiday must be paid, in addition to the amount he/she ordinarily would be
entitled to for that day’s work, the cash equivalent of a full-day’s pay up to
8 hours, or be furnished another day off with pay. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.174(c)(1)-(2).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  An employee’s entitlement to holiday pay fully vests
by working in the w/w in which the named holiday occurs. Accordingly, any
employee who is terminated before receiving the full amount of holiday benefits
due must be paid the holiday benefits as a final cash payment. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.174(c)(4).) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   If the applicable WD does not include a paid holiday
provision for any day declared by the U.S. President to be a holiday, or for
any work day where the Federal facility is closed such as due to inclement
weather, the contractor is not required to pay covered service employees who
take that day off. Any pay provided would be a matter of discretion for the
contractor, and contract payments for such time not worked would be a
procurement matter within the purview of the contracting agency.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14j05 - Temporary and part-time employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The SCA makes no distinction between temporary,
part-time, and full-time employees. In the absence of express limitations, the
FBs specified in the WD apply to all temporary and part-time service employees
engaged in covered work. However, in general, temporary and part-time employees
are only entitled to an amount of the FBs specified in the WD which is
proportionate (i.e., a pro rata share) to the amount of time spent in covered
work. Unless otherwise specified in the WD, vacation and holiday benefits are
based upon a full-time schedule that consists of 40 hours a week or eight hours
a day. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.165(a)(2), 4.176(a); FOH 14i00(c).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Holiday obligations to temporary and part-time
employees who work an irregular schedule of hours may be discharged by paying
such employees a proportion of the holiday benefits due full-time employees
based on the number of hours the temporary and part-time employee worked in the
w/w prior to the w/w in which the holiday occurs. With respect to vacation
obligations, the number of hours such employee worked in the year preceding the
employee’s anniversary date of employment may be utilized to determine vacation
benefits due. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.176(a)(3).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14j06 - Health and welfare (H&amp;W) and pension payments.</h3>
<p>                                    </p>
<p>(a)   As set forth in AAM No. 188, a single “prevailing”
nationwide H&amp;W rate method has been established for determining FB
requirements to be incorporated in most SCA WDs. The single rate is generally
updated once a year based upon data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
Employment Cost Index (ECI) summary of Employer Cost for Employee Compensation.
(See 29 C.F.R. 4.52(a), 4.175.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  “Fixed cost” per employee H&amp;W FBs (29 C.F.R.
4.175(a)).            </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Most prevailing WDs containing
H&amp;W and/or pension requirements specify a fixed payment per hour on behalf
of each service employee. This FB is due each service employee on the basis of
“all hours paid for,” including paid vacations, holidays, and sick leave, up to
a maximum of 40 hours per week and 2,080 hours per year. Payments are specified
on the WD in hourly, weekly, and monthly amounts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
If a WD specifies a FB that can be
obtained for less than the amount of contribution required on the WD, the
employer must make up the difference in cash to the employee, or furnish
equivalent benefits, or a combination thereof. The FBs and cash equivalent
payments under the “fixed cost” per employee benefit requirement may be made in
varying amounts to employees, provided the total amount paid by the contractor
for FBs and/or cash equivalents to each individual employee is at least the
amount required by the WD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   “Average cost” H&amp;W FBs (29 C.F.R. 4.175(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Some WDs specifically provide for
H&amp;W and/or pension benefits in terms of average cost. In such cases, a
contractor’s contributions per employee to a “bona fide” plan are permitted to
vary, depending upon the individual employee’s marital or employment status. It
is also possible under the “average cost” concept for some employees to not
receive any FBs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The contractor’s total contributions
for all service employees enrolled in the plan must average at least the WD
requirements per hour per service employee. In determining average cost, “all
hours worked,” including overtime hours, for all service employees that were
employed on the contract during the payment period must be counted. The term
“all hours worked” does not include paid leave hours, such as vacations,
holidays, or sick leave. It also does not cover any unpaid leave time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
The contractor’s total
contributions for all service employees enrolled in the FB plan(s) must average
at least the FB obligation stated in the WD. The types and amounts of benefits
(if any) provided, and the eligibility requirements for service employees to
participate in a FB plan, are decided by the employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
If the contractor’s contributions
average less than the amount required during a payment period, the contractor
must make up the deficiency by providing cash equivalent payments or equivalent
FB payments to all service employees who worked on the contract during the
payment period. However, cash equivalent payments under the “average cost” FB
requirements can only be made in an amount determined to be deficient after
payments have been made to the FB plans, and then must be made equally to all
service employees based upon their hours worked. A contractor cannot make cash
equivalent payments to some employees and not to others, nor can a contractor
pay different cash amounts to employees under the same contract. A contractor
must pay the same amount of cash equivalent payments per hour worked to all
employees. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Some H&amp;W and pension plans contain eligibility
exclusions for certain employees. Also, employees receiving benefits through
participation in plans of an employer other than the contractor or by a
spouse’s employer may be prevented from receiving benefits from the
contractor’s plan because of prohibitions against “double coverage.” While such
exclusions do not invalidate an otherwise bona fide plan, the employees excluded
from participation in the plan must be furnished equivalent bona fide FBs or be
paid a cash equivalent payment during the period they are not eligible, or
choose not to participate in the plan. An employee who desires to opt-out of
the contractor’s health plan must demonstrate that his or her other coverage
specifically prohibits double coverage in writing. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(c).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   It is not required that all employees participating in
a FB plan be entitled to receive payments from the plan at all times. For
example, a contractor may be permitted to claim credit for contributions made
to FB plans on behalf of participating employees during periods of time when
they may not be entitled to receive benefits (e.g., a 30-day “waiting period”
under some insurance plans for newly hired employees). If no contributions are
made for such employees, then no credit may be taken toward the contractor’s FB
obligations. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(c)(2).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Payments to a “bona fide” H&amp;W or pension insurance
plan or trust program may be made on a periodic basis, but not less often than
quarterly. If the plan requires that contributions be made on a monthly basis,
then to be in compliance the contractor must reconcile the cost incurred by
such contributions against its SCA FB obligations on a monthly (or no less
often than monthly) basis. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.175(d)(1).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Where the WD specifies a fixed contribution on behalf
of each employee, and a contractor exercises the option to make hourly cash
equivalent or differential payments, such payments must be made promptly on the
regular payday for wages. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.165(a)(1), 4.175(d)(1),
4.177(c)(1).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)  The only restriction the SCA places on pension plans,
including 401(k) plans, is that they be “bona fide” FB plans. Such plans are
considered “bona fide” if they meet the requirements of Section 7(e)(4) of the
FLSA. (See FLSA 29 C.F.R. 778.215; SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.170, 4.171(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Neither the SCA nor its
implementing regulations address vesting requirements with respect to retirement
plans. However, bona fide plans are required to meet the vesting requirements
pursuant to ERISA. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.171(a)(5).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Pension plans that define a year’s
service for vesting purposes in terms of a minimum number of hours worked by a
participant and require certain number of years in service for a participant to
become fully vested would be in compliance with the SCA so long as the plan’s
vesting provisions meet ERISA’s requirements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Pension plans often provide that
forfeitures of employees who do not vest under the plan will be used to reduce
the employer’s contribution in the following year. For SCA purposes, an
employer may not use forfeitures as a credit towards satisfying the
requirements of an applicable WD. To allow an employer to do so would result in
the employer’s taking double credit for the same contribution. Forfeitures that
are allocated to the accounts of remaining eligible participants would,
however, be creditable toward meeting FB obligations under the SCA.</p>

<h3>14k00 - General provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The SCA does not provide for compensation of covered
employees at premium rates for overtime hours of work. Section 6 of the Act
recognizes that other Federal laws, such as the FLSA and CWHSSA may require
such compensation to be paid to employees working on or in connection with
SCA-covered contracts. CWHSSA (40 U.S.C. 327 - 332) is more limited in scope
than the FLSA (29 U.S.C. 201, et seq.) and generally applies to Federal Government
contracts in excess of $100,000 that require or involve the employment of
laborers, mechanics, guards, and “watchmen.” (See SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.180 - 4.182;
CWHSSA 29 C.F.R. 5.1 - 5.17; FLSA 29 C.F.R. 778; FOH 15g - k and 32.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Overtime must be paid at one and one-half times the
basic hourly rate (or the regular rate of pay, whichever is higher). (See SCA
29 C.F.R. 4.180 - 4.182; CWHSSA 29 C.F.R. 5.5(b)(1); FLSA 29 C.F.R. Part 778;
FOH 15k00 - 15k09 and 32.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The SCA excludes the amounts paid by a contractor or
subcontractor for FBs in the computation of overtime under the FLSA and CWHSSA
whenever the overtime provisions of either of those acts apply concurrently
with the SCA’s wage provisions. (See SCA 4.177(e), 4.180; FLSA 29 C.F.R.
778.7.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Neither the FLSA, nor the CWHSSA, preclude any State,
territory, or municipality from implementing its own labor standards with
respect to minimum wage and overtime compensation. If Federal and State laws
have different requirements, a contractor would be obligated to satisfy both
sets of standards in order to ensure compliance. (See FLSA 29 C.F.R. 778.5.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   The CWHSSA requires that “liquidated damages shall be
computed, with respect to each individual employed as a laborer or mechanic in
violation of any provision of this Act, in the sum of $10 for each calendar day
on which such individual was required or permitted to work in excess of the
standard workweek of 40 hours without payment of the overtime required by this
Act.” In addition, in all cases, liquidated damages are also required to be
computed in situations where an employee is paid overtime at an incorrect basic
hourly rate of pay. (See CWHSSA 29 C.F.R. 5.8; FOH 15k10.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>14k01 - “Laborers” and “Mechanics” under CWHSSA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Service employees may also be “laborers” and
“mechanics” for purposes of CWHSSA. The terms “laborers” and “mechanics”
include at least those employees whose duties are manual or physical in nature
as distinguished from mental or managerial. Generally, employees whose duties
are supervisory, professional, and clerical are not “laborers” or “mechanics”
for purposes of CWHSSA. Determinations as to whether individual employees are
“laborers” or “mechanics” are based on the duties actually performed under the
contract rather than occupational titles or job descriptions. A job that
requires manual and mechanical dexterity and is primarily reliant on the use of
hands would be typical of mechanical or manual occupations that would fall with
the scope of a “laborer” or “mechanic” under CWHSSA. The CWHSSA also applies to
guards and “watchmen” employed on Government contracts in excess of $100,000.
(See SCA 29 C.F.R. 4.181(b); CWHSSA 29 C.F.R. 5.5(b); FOH 15j.)</p>

<h3>14L00 - Payroll and record keeping requirements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Payrolls and basic records relating thereto, including
a copy of the contract, must be maintained and preserved for three years from
the completion of the contract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(g), 4.185.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The failure of a contractor to make the required
records available to a WHI may result in the suspension of contract payments
until such violations cease. Contractors must also permit the WHI to conduct
employee interviews at the worksite during normal working hours. (See 29 C.F.R.
4.6(g).)     </p>

<h3>15a0l - The Davis-Bacon Act.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This Act applies to
contracts in excess of $2,000 for the construction, alteration, and/or repair
of public buildings or public works, including painting and decorating, where
the United States or the District of Columbia is a direct party to the
contract. The Act requires all contractors and subcontractors to pay the
various classes of laborers and mechanics employed on the site of the work on
the contract the wage rates and fringe benefits determined by the S/L to be
prevailing for corresponding classes of employees engaged on similar projects
in the locality. In addition, the Act requires that certain labor standards
provisions be specified in the contract awarded to the successful bidder (see
29 CFR § 5.5 (a)). An applicable wage determination must also be included in
the contract documents.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15a00 - Purpose and use of FOH Chapter 15.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   This Chapter supplements 29 CFR Parts 1, 3, 5, 6, and
7, pertaining to a group of statutes generally identified as the Davis-Bacon
and Related Acts (DBRA) and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act
(CWHSSA). Many Related Acts are listed in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix A, and 29 CFR
§ 5.1. The Davis-Bacon Act (DBA or D-B Act), the Copeland Anti-Kickback Act,
the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, and 29 CFR Parts 1, 3, 5, 6,
and 7 are available at <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/contracts/dbra.htm">http://www.dol.gov/whd/contracts/dbra.htm</a><a name="_Hlt240128855"></a> or at http://<a href="http://www.wdol.gov">www.wdol.gov</a>/ in the “Library”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Under Reorganization Plan No. 14 of 1950 (64 Stat.
1267) the Federal contracting or other administering agency has the primary
responsibility for the enforcement of the DBRA/CWHSSA labor standards
provisions included in its contracts. The Secretary of Labor (S/L) has
coordination and oversight responsibilities, including the authority to
investigate labor standards compliance as warranted. Pursuant to the authority
under the Plan, the S/L has issued the Regulations referenced in (a) to
coordinate the administration and enforcement of DBRA/CWHSSA labor standards.
All Agency Memorandum (AAM) No. 76, dated     May 31, 1968 to Agencies
Administering Statutes Referred to in 29 CFR, Part 5, Subpart A, reflects an
agreement between the DOL and the contracting agencies for administering the
labor standards of DBRA/CWHSSA. AAM Nos. 118, 129 and 177 were subsequently
issued to remind all contracting agencies of their labor standards enforcement
responsibilities.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15a02 - The Related Acts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>These are Federal statutes
which authorize Federal assistance in the form of contributions, grants, loans,
insurance, or guarantees for programs such as the construction of hospitals,
housing complexes, sewage treatment plants, highways, and airports. Included in
the language of these statutes are references to the D-B labor standards
provisions and the requirement that laborers and mechanics be paid prevailing
wage rates. Since Congress is continually enacting and amending legislation,
the list of the DBRAs in the Regulations may not be completely up to date.
Consequently, it may be necessary to consult the RO for verification of DBRA
coverage.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15a03 - The Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   This Act contains weekly (after 40 hours) OT pay
requirements and applies to most Federal contracts which may require or involve
the employment of laborers or mechanics, including watchmen and guards, and to
which any agency or instrumentality of the United States or the District of
Columbia or a Territory is a party. (See FOH 15g.) CWHSSA was amended by Public
Law 99-145 (effective January 1, 1986) to eliminate the daily OT provisions
(AAM # 143, Dec 23, 1985).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Contracts for construction or services in excess of
$100,000 are covered by CWHSSA. This Act also extends to Federally-assisted
contracts subject to DBRA wage standards to which the Federal government is not
a direct party, except where the Federal assistance is only in the nature of a
loan guarantee or insurance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Contracts exempt from this Act are discussed in FOH
15i00.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Sec. 102 of CWHSSA requires that laborers and
mechanics employed on covered contracts be paid not less than one and one-half
times their basic rate of pay for hours worked in excess of forty in a w/w. It
also provides for liquidated damages in the sum of $10 for each calendar day
(with respect to each employee employed in violation) on which an employee was
required or permitted to work overtime hours without the payment of OT wages
required by CWHSSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Section 107 of the Act provides health and safety
standards on covered construction work which are administered by OSHA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15a04 - The Copeland “Anti-Kickback” Act.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The “Anti-Kickback” section of the Copeland Act makes
it punishable by a fine or by imprisonment up to 5 years, or both, to induce
any person working on a Federally-funded or assisted construction project to
“give up any part of the compensation to which he is entitled under his
contract of employment”. (See “Anti-Kickback” Act, Copeland Act, and 29 CFR
Part 3)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Regulations pertaining to Copeland Act payroll
deductions are contained in 29 CFR Part 3. Deductions permissible without
application for approval by the S/L are explained in 29 CFR § 3.5; those which
require approval are explained in 29 CFR § 3.6. Note in 29 CFR § 3.5 that
certain deductions, including those which meet the requirements of FLSA Sec
3(m), 29 CFR Part 531, can be made without the consent of the S/L. The Copeland
Act and 29 CFR §§ 3.3 and 3.4 require the contractor or subcontractor to file a
weekly “Statement of Compliance”. 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(3)(ii) requires, as a
contract stipulation, that the contractor submit weekly to the contracting
agency a copy of all payrolls, along with a weekly “Statement of Compliance”.
Contractors may use Optional Form WH-347, available at <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/wh347instr.htm">http://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/wh347instr.htm</a> for this purpose.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The willful falsification of a payroll report or
“Statement of Compliance” may subject the employer to civil or criminal
prosecution under section 1001 of Title 18 and section 3729 of Title 31 of the
U.S.C. and may also be a cause for debarment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  The “Anti-Kickback” provision applies to any
Federally-funded or assisted construction contract except contracts for which
the only assistance is a loan guarantee. This provision applies even where the
contract is not covered by a labor standards statute. 29 CFR Part 3, as
explained above, applies only to payroll deductions made under contracts
subject to Federal wage standards.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15a05 - The Miller Act (40 U.S.C. §§ 3131-3133).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   This Act provides, in general, that Federal contracts
in excess of $100,000 for construction, alteration, or repair of any public
building or public work of the United States, may not be awarded to any person,
until such person furnishes to the United States a bond with a surety
satisfactory to the contracting officer for the protection of all persons
supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in the
contract.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The Department of Labor exercises no functions under
the Miller Act, but the information in this section is pertinent since the Act
provides protection to laborers and mechanics, and its application is
coextensive with the D-B Act, except for the $100,000 threshold. In order to
protect their rights under this Act, employees of prime contractors or first-tier
subcontractors must give written notice by registered mail to the prime
contractor of failure to receive proper wages within 90 days of the date of
performance of the last labor by the underpaid worker. Employees of lower tier
sub-subcontractors are not protected by the Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Suits to recover wages under the Miller Act must be
commenced within one year after the date on which the last of the labor was
performed and must be brought in the name of the United States, for the use of
the person suing, in the United States District Court for any district in which
the contract was to be performed and executed. Suit is brought and prosecuted
by the worker’s own attorney. Although the Miller Act does not apply to
Federally-assisted projects (i.e., the Related Acts), many States and grant
programs require surety bonds with substantially similar requirements.</p>

<h3>15b00 - Coverage - General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Coverage is extended to construction contracts awarded
directly by the Federal government or financially assisted under any statute
referencing D-B labor standards, including but not limited to those listed in
29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. However, if a statute authorizes assistance but does not
include either directly or by reference aD-B labor standards clause, the DBRA
does not apply. (See (b) below.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  In situations where a project is funded under a number
of Federal statutes, DBRA applies to the project if any one of the statutes
authorizing a portion of the financial assistance requires payment of Davis
Bacon wages. To verify coverage under various DBRA contracts, contact the
Regional Wage Specialist (RWS).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (Pub.
L. 97-424), effective January 6, 1983, expanded D-B coverage to all Federal-aid
highway construction projects to include those involving resurfacing,
restoration, rehabilitation, and reconstruction (“4-R” work). Previously,
Section 113 of Title 23, U.S.C., The Federal-Aid Highway Act, had been
construed to exclude 4-R work from “initial construction.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  The $2,000 threshold for coverage pertains to the
amount of the prime contract, not to the amount of individual subcontracts. If
the prime contract exceeds $2,000, all work on the project is covered.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15b01 - Geographical scope.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The scope of the D-B is
limited, by its terms, to the fifty states and the District of Columbia and the
Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. The scope of each of the related Acts
is determined by the terms of the particular statute under which the Federal
assistance is provided. For example, DBRA would apply to a construction
contract funded under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 located
in Guam or the Virgin Islands. However, although direct D-B would not apply in
places such as Guam or the Virgin Islands, CWHSSA would apply. (See FOH 15g00.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15b02 - Statute of limitations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The Portal-to-Portal Act (PA) applies to the D-B Act.
It prevents the commencement of any court suit for unpaid straight-time wages
more than 2 years after performance of the work (3 years in the case of willful
violations), where such actions are judicially determined to be permissible
under the law. However, it is the Department’s position that the PA does not
apply to administrative actions initiated through the ALJ hearing procedures,
and thus, the PA does not preclude such corrective administrative action after
two (or three) years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Failure to pay the minimum rates specified in a D-B contract
is a breach of the contract, and the contracting agency may withhold funds
sufficient to pay the unpaid employees. Such funds may be withheld from the
contractor without regard to the statute of limitations in the PA and may be
transferred to the Comptroller General and paid to the underpaid employee
without regard to such time limit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The PA does not apply to Federally-assisted projects
(the Related Acts) on which D-B wage rates are required to be paid. The various
State statutes of limitations would apply to such projects in private actions
where they are judicially determined to be permissible under the law. The
federal six-year statute of limitations would apply in government enforcement
actions (28 U.S.C. § 2415(a)).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15b03 - Definition of public building
or public work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The term “public building”
or “public work” includes building or work, the construction, prosecution,
completion, or repair of which is carried on directly by authority of or with
funds of a Federal agency to serve the interest of the general public
regardless of whether title thereof is in a Federal agency. (See 29 CFR §
5.2(k).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15b04 - Site of the work -
definition.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The D-B Act provides that every covered contract must
contain a stipulation that the contractor or subcontractor must pay all
mechanics and laborers “employed directly upon the site of the work” at wage
rates not less than those stated in the advertised specifications. The Related
Acts which provide for Federal construction assistance contain no reference to
“site of the work”. However, 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(1)(i) prescribes a contract clause
which in effect extends the “site of the work” concept to the Related Acts.
Certain HUD Related Acts, including the United States Housing Act of 1937 and
the Housing Act of 1949, however, specifically require payment of not less than
the wage rates prescribed to all mechanics and laborers employed “in the
construction and development of the project”. In short there is no “site of the
work” concept with respect to the United States Housing Act of 1937 or the
Housing Act of 1949. (It should be noted that the OT requirements of CWHSSA
apply to all laborers and mechanics performing contract work, regardless of the
site of their employment. See FOH l5g03.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The D-B Act limits coverage to laborers and mechanics
employed on the “site of the work” but does not define this term. “Site of the
work” is defined in 29 CFR § 5.2(l). The description below provides general
guidance used by WHD in D-B and DBRA investigations:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
The “site of the work” is the
physical place or places where the building or work called for in the contract
will remain and any other site where a significant portion of the building or
work is constructed, provided that such site is established specifically for
the performance of the contract or project. (29 CFR § 5.2(l)(1)) For example:</p>
<p>                                             
a.     if a small office building is being erected, the “site
of work” will normally include no more than the building itself and its
grounds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     In the case of larger contracts, such as for airports,
highways, or dams, the “site of the work” is necessarily more extensive and may
include the whole area in which the construction activity will take place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     Where a very large segment of the dam is constructed
up-river and floated downstream to be affixed onto a support structure, the
secondary construction site would be within the meaning of “site of the work”
for Davis-Bacon purposes if it was established for and dedicated to the dam
construction project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Except as provided in paragraph 29
CFR § 5.2(l)(3), batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards, etc.,
are part of the “site of work” provided they are dedicated exclusively or
nearly so to the contract or project, and are adjacent or virtually adjacent to
the site of the work as defined in 29 CFR § 5.2(l)(1).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Not included in the ”site of the work”
are permanent home offices, branch plant establishments, fabrication plants,
and tool yards, etc. of a contractor or subcontractor whose locations and
continuance in operation are determined wholly without regard to a particular
Federal or federally-assisted contract or project. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also excluded from the “site of the work” are
fabrication plants, batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards,
etc, of a commercial or material supplier which are established by a supplier
of materials for the project before opening of bids and not on the site of the
work as stated in 29 CFR § 5.2(l)(1), even where such operations for a period
of time may be dedicated exclusively, or nearly so, to the performance of a
contract.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Once the limits of “site of the work” have been
determined, the wage determination applies only to those mechanics and laborers
employed by a contractor or subcontractor on the site of the work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  In 2000, DOL revised the two related definitions in
the regulations that set forth rules for the administration and enforcement of
the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements. Revisions in the regulatory
definitions of “site of the work” and “construction, prosecution, completion,
or repair” were made to clarify the regulatory requirements in view of three U.
S. appellate court decisions, which had concluded that DOL’s application of
these related regulatory definitions was at odds with the language of the
Davis-Bacon Act that limits coverage to workers employed “directly upon the
site of the work,”. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a full discussion of the
revisions made to the regulatory definition of the “site of the work” in 2000,
see the final rule published in the Federal Register on December 20, 2000, 65
FR 80268-80278. (see also Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO
v. United States Department of Labor Wage Appeals Board, 932 F.2d 985(D.C. Cir
1991) (Midway), Ball, Ball and Brosamer v. Reich (D.C. Cir 1994) and Cavett
Company v. U.S. Department of Labor 101 F. 3d 1111 (6th Cir. 1996). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   The FAR (48 CFR §§ 52.222.5 through .11) has been
revised to address the issue of secondary sites that may be considered to be
within the regulatory definition of “site of the work”. Therefore, federal
contract stipulations include provisions that address the possibility of a
covered secondary site of work. Contracting agencies should consult the Wage
and Hour Division when confronted with “site of work” issues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   CWHSSA has no site of work limitation. (See FOH
15g03.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15b05 - Construction, prosecution, completion,
or repair.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 5.2(j) defines the
terms “construction, prosecution, completion, or repair” to mean all types of
work done on a particular building or work at the site thereof (including work
at a facility deemed part of the “site of the work”) by laborers and mechanics
of a construction contractor or construction subcontractor including without
limitation:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Altering, remodeling, and installation (where
appropriate) on the site of the work of items fabricated off-site.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Painting and decorating.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The manufacturing or furnishing of material, articles,
supplies or equipment on the site of the building or work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Transportation between the “site of the work” (within
the meaning of 29 CFR § 5.2 (l)) and a facility which is dedicated to the
construction of the building or work and deemed a part of the “site of the
work” (within the meaning of 29 CFR § 5.2(l)).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15b06 - “Force account” construction
work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   In some instances a Government agency (or a State or
political subdivision thereof using Federal money) may perform construction
work under what is generally known as “force account”. In essence, this is a
“do-it-yourself” type of construction - the governmental agency receiving the
grant decides not to contract out the work but actually performs it “in-house”
with its own employees. Such work is not generally subject to DBRA/CWHSSA
because governmental agencies and States or their political subdivisions are
not considered “contractors” or “subcontractors” within the meaning of the D-B
Act. However, any part of the work not done under “force account” but
contracted out is subject to DBRA/CWHSSA in the usual manner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Certain related acts require payment of prevailing
wages to all laborers and mechanics “employed in the construction (or
development) of the project” (e.g., the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 and the
Housing Act of 1949). (See FOH l5e13.) State and local government agencies
receiving Federal assistance under statutes containing this or similar wording
not restricting coverage to employees of contractors or subcontractors, which
perform construction with their own employees, must pay such employees
according to DBRA/CWHSSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15b07 - Lease arrangements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Where the Government enters into a lease/purchase
agreement D-B applies, because the cost of the construction is eventually paid
for by the Government. D-B also applies to a lease option or to a term lease
agreement where there is substantial and segregable construction activity, and
where the structure is a public building or public work. This may be true, for
example, where the building is built at the request of the Government pursuant
to Government specifications for Government use or purpose for the period of
the lease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  AAM #176 identifies the following factors as among
those to be considered in determining whether a lease/construction contract is
construction for Davis-Bacon:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
“Length of Lease”,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Extent of government involvement
in the construction project (such as whether the building is being built to
Government requirements and whether the Government has the right to inspect the
progress of the work),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
The extent to which the
construction will be used for private rather than public purposes,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
The extent to which the costs of
construction will be fully paid for by the lease payments. And</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5) 
Whether the contract is written as
a lease solely to evade the requirements of the D-B Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Postal Service lease agreements are governed by the
Postal Reorganization Act (39 U.S.C. § 410(d)). Under the terms of that Act,
Postal Service lease agreements for rent of net interior space in excess of
6,500 square feet are required to include DB labor standards for any
construction, modification, alteration, repair, painting, decoration, or other
improvement of the facility covered by the agreement.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15b08  Post exchange contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The D-B Act applies to Post exchange
contracts for construction, alteration or repair of buildings regardless of
whether such contracts are paid for with appropriated or nonappropriated funds.</p>

<h3>15c00 - Exceptions to coverage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Section 4 of the D-B Act provides that “this Act shall
not be construed to supersede or impair any authority otherwise granted by
Federal law to provide for the establishment of specific wage rates.” Thus, for
example:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
If a railroad undertakes to
perform a contract normally subject to DBRA, coverage is not extended to
employees of railroad common carriers if they are covered by the Railway Labor
Act. However, if the railroad contracts out such construction work, laborers
and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors are covered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
While the D-B Act contains no
express exemption for common carriers, coverage is not extended to common
carriers who are hauling over regularly scheduled routes in accordance with
published tariff rates and pursuant to a bill of lading. On the other hand,
transportation of materials from an exclusive borrow pit to fulfill the
specific needs of a construction contract would not normally be within the common
carrier exception since such transportation is not normally carried out over a
regularly scheduled route in accordance with published tariff rates and
pursuant to a bill of lading.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Under the terms of certain authorizing statutes, DBRA
does not apply to construction of less than a designated number of housing
units. For example:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Section 110 of the Housing and
Community Development Act of 1974 - rehabilitation of residential property
designed for fewer than 8 families.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Section 802 of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1974 - construction of residential property designed for
fewer than 8 families.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Section 12 of the U.S. Housing Act
of 1937 - fewer than 9 units.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
Sections 212, 220 and 233 of the
National Housing Act - fewer than 12 units.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5) 
Sections 212, 221 and 235(j) (1)
of the National Housing Act - fewer than 8 families.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6) 
Section 287 of the Cranston-Gonzalez
National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 - fewer than 12 units</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Section 14 of the United States Housing Act of 1937
established the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP), under
which HUD provides financial assistance to public housing agencies for
improvement of existing public housing projects and upgrading of the management
and operation of such projects. Section 12 of that Act sets forth the labor
standards which must be contained in any contract for loans, annual
contributions, sale or leases pursuant to the Act, and provides that (1) all
laborers and mechanics employed in the development of a CIAP-funded lower
income housing project be paid DBRA wages, and (2) all maintenance laborers and
mechanics employed in the operation of such a project be paid wages prevailing
in the locality as established by HUD. While most CIAP-funded work items are
developmental for purposes of prevailing wage rate determinations and are
therefore subject to DBRA, certain work items (“non-routine maintenance”,
formerly referred to by HUD as “major repairs”), in addition to routine
maintenance, are recognized as operational and are subject to HUD-determined
(not DBRA) rates. HUD has issued guidance to its field offices and public
housing agencies (see also 24 CFR §§ 968.105 and 110), which distinguishes work
items subject to HUD-determined or to DBRA prevailing wages. In essence, repair
or replacement necessitated by normal wear and tear over time is to be
considered operational and outside the coverage of DBRA, provided that the work
is not so substantial as to constitute reconstruction. Thus, conversion of
equipment or premises and replacement or alteration of property which results
in betterment and involves significant construction activity is subject to
DBRA. Any questions on the proper classification of particular work items
subject to DBRA under CIAP which cannot be resolved locally with HUD will be
referred though channels to the RWS and NO, if necessary. WH does not enforce
HUD-determined wage rates under CIAP.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Construction projects administered by the Farmers Home
Administration and funded under the Community Facility Program of the Farm and
Rural Development Act of 1972 or under section 515, Title V of the Housing Act
of 1949, as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, do
not contain D-B labor standards and are not covered if there is no other
federal assistance containing D-B labor standards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Projects solely funded under the Land and Water
Conservation Fund Act of 1965 or under the Colorado River Basin Project Act are
not covered.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15c01 - Waivers of coverage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   DOL does not have the authority to grant waivers from D-B
coverage of a contract to which the Government is a direct party or from a
federally assisted (i.e., DBRA) contract. However, in some cases, the
particular DBRA statute funding the project may specifically provide for a
waiver or an exemption by the administering agency from the provisions of the
Davis-Bacon Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Pursuant to authority under section 107 of the Housing
and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 USC § 5307(e)(2))., the
Secretary of HUD has waived the DBRA/CWHSSA labor standards requirements in
connection with Community Development Block Grants for Indian Tribes and
Alaskan Native villages .</p>

<h3>15d00 - ARRA-American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Davis-Bacon coverage under ARRA. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
AAM #207 outlined the
applicability of the DB labor standards to ARRA funded projects. The ARRA was
signed by President Obama on February 17, 2009. The ARRA appropriated
substantial funding for construction, alteration and repair of Federal
buildings and for infrastructure projects. Federal agencies directly
contracting for construction work are required by existing DBA requirements to
ensure that bid solicitations and resulting contracts contain DB labor
standards and WDs. Federal agencies must ensure that recipients of assistance
under ARRA require contractors and subcontractors to pay laborers and mechanics
on Federally-assisted construction projects at least the prevailing wages as
determined under the DBA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Specifically, Section 1606 of Division A of ARRA
states that DBA’s prevailing wage requirement applies to ARRA-appropriated
construction projects, as follows: “Notwithstanding any other provision of law
and in a manner consistent with other provisions of this Act, all laborers and
mechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors on projects funded
directly by or assisted in whole or in part by and through the Federal
government pursuant to this Act shall be paid wages at rates not less than
those prevailing on projects of a character similar in the locality as
determined by the Secretary of Labor… .”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The language “notwithstanding any other provision of
law” explicitly overrides any limitation to Davis-Bacon coverage that may be
contained in other Davis-Bacon Related Acts. Therefore, if a construction
project is funded under multiple statutes, including one with a pre-existing
Davis-Bacon related Act provision as well as ARRA, then the ARRA prevailing
wage requirement applies if any such ARRA assistance is provided for the
project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two provisions of ARRA exempt certain tribal contracts
from Section 1606. One provision states that section 1606 does not apply “to
tribal contracts entered into by the Bureau of Indian Affairs” with the
appropriations provided under ARRA for repair and restoration of roads; school
improvements, repairs and replacement construction; and detention center
maintenance and repairs. A second provision states that section 1606 does not
apply “to tribal contracts entered into by the [HHS Indian Health] Service&quot;
with the ARRA appropriation for Indian health facilities construction projects.
Of course, even though ARRA does not apply DB to those projects, if the
projects receive funding under another related Act that requires DB prevailing
wage requirements, those requirements would continue to apply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Prevailing wage coverage under ARRA-assisted projects
must be determined in the same manner as under the DBA. ARRA-assisted projects
must follow the requirements in regulations 29 CFR 1, 3 and 5.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
AAM # 208 outlined the
applicability of the DB labor standards to projects financed with the proceeds
of the five tax-favored bonds listed in section 1601 of Division B of ARRA. It
also highlighted the responsibilities of state and local governmental entities,
contractors, and others for implementation of, and compliance with, the
Davis-Bacon labor standards in connection with projects financed with the
proceeds of the tax-favored bonds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Specifically, Section 1601 of Division B of ARRA provides
that the DBA’s prevailing wage requirement applies to projects financed with
the proceeds of:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     Any new clean renewable energy bond (as defined in
section 54C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) issued after the date of the
enactment of ARRA Division B.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     Any qualified energy conservation bond (as defined in
section 4D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) issued after the date of the
enactment of ARRA Division B.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     Any qualified zone academy bond (as defined in section
54E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) issued after the date of the
enactment of ARRA Division B.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
d.     Any qualified school construction bond (as defined in
section 54F of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
e.     Any recovery zone economic development bond (as
defined in section 1400U–2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An entity (usually a state or local government agency)
with contracting responsibility for a project financed with the proceeds of one
of the five tax-favored bonds must cause or require the contracting officer for
the project, at least as soon as the entity receives notice of ARRA assistance
with respect to the project, to insert in full the standard D-B contract
clauses found in 29 CFR 5.5(a) (and the applicable wage determination in effect
at the time of notice of ARRA assistance) in bid solicitations and covered
construction contracts that are in excess of $2,000 for construction,
alteration or repair (including painting and decorating).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The requirement to insert the standard D-B contract
clauses and attach the applicable wage determination in effect at the time of
notice of ARRA assistance applies regardless of the amount or form of ARRA
funding or assistance. Thus, coverage under section 1601 of Division B of ARRA
can exist even if a project is financed only in part by proceeds of one of the
bonds listed in section 1601. If bond proceeds are pooled in a general fund or
otherwise, then every project financed in whole or in part by the pooled
proceeds is subject to Davis-Bacon requirements provided that other applicable
coverage criteria are satisfied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Weatherization contracts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Using ARRA appropriations,
the Department of Energy awards grants under the Weatherization Assistance
Program to state-level government agencies. These agencies then contract with
local agencies, usually Community Action Agencies, to deliver weatherization
services to eligible residents. Individuals and families apply for assistance
through the local agencies. If approved for services, professionally trained
weatherization assistance program technicians perform on-site audits to identify
cost-effective measures that can be taken. Crews then make the repairs and
improvements to increase energy efficiency. The technicians conducting the
audits are typically employees of the governmental or community action agency.
The repair crews typically work for contractors. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is WHD’s longstanding
position that governmental agencies are not contractors or subcontractors
within the meaning of the DBA when the construction is performed by their own
employees on a “force account” basis. (See FOH 15b06.) However, laborers or
mechanics employed by a private, non-profit Community Action Agency cannot be
considered as force account labor and will be covered under the DB labor
standards requirements when performing ARRA-assisted weatherization work. In addition,
when the Community Action Agency contracts out work that is assisted with ARRA
funding, the Agency must apply the DB labor standards and appropriate WD to the
contract. Therefore, repair crews performing the duties of laborers or
mechanics for a Community Action Agency or its contractors must be paid at
least the DB prevailing wage. Certain activities such as energy audits and
inspections are not viewed as construction work performed by laborers or
mechanics within the meaning of the DBA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   State Energy Program (SEP) and individual homeowners.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DOE, through its Office of
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), operates a State Energy Program
(SEP) that provides grants to States that may be used to fund individual
States’ SEP plans. These grants are funded in whole or in part by ARRA. An
individual homeowner who receives a rebate for material and/or labor costs he
or she has incurred in connection with qualifying energy efficiency and
weatherization improvements to his or her home under a DOE SEP rebate program
is not responsible for Davis-Bacon compliance. This general interpretation
addresses only whether Davis-Bacon labor standards apply to individual
homeowners who receive a rebate, funded in whole or in part by ARRA, to
reimburse them pursuant to DOE programs for certain energy efficiency and
weatherization improvements to their homes.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15d01 - Carpet laying and
installation of draperies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>DBRA applies to carpet
laying and the installation of draperies when it is performed as an integral
part of or in conjunction with new construction, alteration, or reconstruction.
On federal contracts the SCA applies to carpet laying when it is performed as a
part of routine maintenance, e.g., replacement of worn out carpeting in a
public building or a public work where no other construction is contemplated.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>15d02 - Clean-up work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Cleaning work is covered by
the DBRA in situations where the cleaning is performed as a condition precedent
to the acceptance of a building as satisfactorily completed. For example, this
would include activities such as window scraping and washing, removal of excess
paint, and sweeping. Where cleaning is carried out after the construction
contractor and subcontractors have finished their work, left the site, and the
contracting agency has accepted the project as completed, such work would not
be considered a part of the “construction” and would not be covered under DBRA.
(However, SCA may apply in the latter situation if there is a direct contract
with the Federal Government.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15d03 - Demolition work in relation
to construction.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   To determine whether a demolition contract is subject
to DBRA, it is necessary to look at the entire scope of that contract as well
as other contracts that might be part of the same overall project. Demolition,
standing alone, (except for demolition work under Urban Renewal projects
authorized pursuant to the Housing Act of 1949, as amended) is not necessarily
considered to be “construction, alteration, and/or repair of a public building
or a public work” subject to the prevailing wage requirements of DBRA. For
example, the demolition of a building because such structure is no longer
needed would not in itself be a covered construction activity. However, where
an existing building is being demolished and further construction activity at
the site is contemplated that is subject to DBRA, DBRA would apply to such
demolition, such as demolition performed to permit construction of a new
building or highway (AAM # 190, see also FOH 14d08).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  In some cases, the nature of the demolition or removal
work alone might be considered construction activity covered by DBA. Removal of
asbestos or paint from a facility that will not be demolished would be
considered to be an alteration or repair (AAM # 153) and certain hazardous
waste removal contracts that involve substantial earth moving to remove
contaminated soil and re-contour the surface may be considered construction
(AAM # 187).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15d04 - Disaster relief contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   DBA applies to any direct Federal contract for construction,
alteration or repair of a public building or public work; therefore, DBA
applies to any direct construction contracts awarded by Federal agencies such
as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), Federal Emergency Management
Administration (FEMA), or the U.S. Army.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DB labor standards also
apply to Federally-assisted contracts where the statute authorizing the funding
requires payment of prevailing wage rates in accordance with the DBRA. An
example of such a contract is an EPA grant to complete sewer repair where the
grant is funded by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Grants for disaster relief
under FEMA’s principal relief authority, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief
Act, are not subject to the DBA prevailing wage requirements. FEMA provides
grants for disaster assistance including low-interest loans to repair or
replace personal property, business disaster loans to fund repair or
replacement of real estate, and assistance to state or local governments to pay
costs of rebuilding a community’s damaged infrastructure.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15d05 - Drilling work in various
situations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The application of the Act to a contract for drilling
work would turn upon whether the contract is one for “construction” of “public
works” within the meaning of the D-B Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Exploratory drilling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Drilling, like excavating
generally, is usually considered “construction” activity. The critical question
is whether the holes which would be dug during the course of the exploratory
drilling would be “works” within the statutory term “public work”. The word
“works” in the term “public work” refers typically to improvements, such as
buildings, canals, or roads, rather than mere progress or activity.
Consequently, exploratory drilling for the purpose of obtaining data to be used
in engineering studies and the planning of a project such as a dam and
reservoir, the actual construction of which has not been authorized and for
which funds have not yet been appropriated, would not be within the term “work”
because it relates to an activity as distinguished from a project or
improvement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, the holes themselves,
which are opened to obtain cores and which are subsequently to be filled in or
abandoned, would not be “works” because they are not improvements. The products
sought by the digging are the cores of the earth and not the holes themselves.
(See also FOH 14d02.) In contrast, wells drilled to obtain a water supply for a
military base or a contract for digging of test holes which later may become
“public works” or permit conversion to water wells, oil wells or other “public
works” are covered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Soil boring prior to or during construction for the
purpose of setting foundations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Soil boring contracts are
considered covered by the DBRA if they are directly related and incidental to,
or an integral part of, the actual construction process. This is to be
distinguished from the situation where such contracts are for the formulation
of engineering plans and specifications, designs, and the conduct of site
investigations. The latter activities are regarded as preliminary work, and not
as a part of the construction process. (Also see FOH 14d04.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Plugging of oil or gas wells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A contract which calls for
the plugging of oil or gas wells and the removal of above-ground equipment in
connection with the construction of a reservoir on land containing such wells
would be covered by the DBRA no matter whether the work is characterized as
demolition (the dismantling of the above-ground equipment), incidental to
construction, or well drilling (the rerunning of the tubing and replacement of
the cement plugs).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15d06 - Landscape contracting.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Landscaping performed in
conjunction with new construction or renovation work subject to DBRA is covered.
In addition, elaborate landscaping activities standing alone such as
substantial earth moving and rearrangement of the terrain, e.g., strip mine
reclamation, may constitute construction within the meaning of the D-B Act,
without any requirement that it be related to other construction work (29 CFR §
5.2(i)). Landscaping which is not covered by the D-B Act is work to which the
SCA may be applicable. (See 29 CFR § 4.116.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15d07 - Military housing
privatization contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Army, Navy and Air Force
(Services) are improving the condition of military housing in a project
referred to as the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI). Under this
initiative, in most instances, a private developer leases the land for a long
term and then is responsible for constructing or renovating existing housing
developments using military rental referrals to fund and maintain the newly
renovated and privatized developments. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Services have agreed to
include DB provisions and applicable wage determinations in all MHPI contracts
and have agreed that all developers will be required to comply with the DB
labor standards provisions. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15d08 - Painting and decorating.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>DBRA applies to the
“construction, alteration, and /or repair, including painting and decorating,
of public buildings or public works.&quot; DBRA coverage has been extended to
the painting or repainting of mail collection boxes, street and traffic lines,
the refinishing of floors and bowling lanes, and the installation of wall
covering or hanging wallpaper. Federal contracts for painting of government
owned, privately occupied houses, apartments, commercial properties, etc., are
also covered by the DBRA</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15d09 - Public utility installation.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Whether or not the employees of a public utility, who
perform construction-type work in connection with Federal and federal-assisted
projects, are covered by the DBRA will depend upon the nature of the contracts
involved and the work performed thereunder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Where a public utility is furnishing its own materials
and is in effect extending its own utility system, such work is not subject to
DBRA. The same conclusion would apply where the utility company may contract
out such work for extending its utility system. However, where the utility
company agrees to undertake a portion of the construction of a covered project
such work would be subject to the DBRA labor standards requirements of the
construction contract.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   For example, DBRA wage provisions of the United States
Housing Act do not apply to a contract between a local Housing Authority and a
city water department under which the department installs water mains in
streets adjacent to a housing project; connects mains and meters to the project’s
plumbing; furnishes water to the project; and operates and maintains such mains
and meters without expense to the Authority beyond an initial service charge,
since the city is engaged essentially in the extension of its water
distribution system rather than in the development of the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Also, employees of a telephone company engaged in the
installation of ordinary telephone facilities for a Government facility under
construction are engaged essentially in the extension of the telephone company’s
system rather than in Government construction, and, therefore, are not covered
by the D-B Act. However, removal and relocation of telephone lines at the sole
option of the Government to eliminate interference of the lines with
construction at the project site is construction work covered by the D-B Act.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15d10 - Sewer repair service.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The internal inspection of sewer lines for leakage and
damage through the use of closed circuit T.V. inspection and the simultaneous
sealing of leaks or other damage in the lines as the machine inspects the sewer
line is covered by DBRA. On the other hand, if the contract is only for
inspection, DBRA would not apply. However, SCA would apply in the latter
situation if the Government was a direct party to the contract.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  When this type of work is an issue in an
investigation, an area practice survey (FOH § 15f05) should be conducted to
determine which classification, if any, in the applicable wage determination
performs this work. In conducting the area practice survey, evidence should be
gathered concerning specific projects where repair work was actually performed.
If the survey does not show that a classification in the applicable wage
determination has actually performed this type of work, the use of a conformed
classification and rate would probably be appropriate (29 CFR § 5.5(a)(1)(ii)).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15d11 - Shipbuilding, alteration,
repair, and maintenance.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The building, alteration,
and/or repair of ships under Government contract is work performed upon “public
works” within the meaning of the Davis-Bacon Act. Wage determinations for
shipbuilding under the D-B Act are issued only if the location of contract
performance is known when bids are solicited. However, a Government contract
which calls for the construction, alteration, furnishing, or equipping of a
“naval vessel” (U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard vessels) is subject to PCA. A
contract which calls for maintenance and/or cleaning, rather than alteration or
repair, of a ship or naval vessel is a service contract within the meaning of
the SCA. (See FOH 13b11 and 14c06.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15d12 - Steam and sand blast
cleaning.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A Government contract
requiring steam and sand blast cleaning and water proofing is covered by the
D-B Act. Such cleaning operations performed on public buildings are authorized
for the purpose of renewing the original appearance of these buildings and are
performed for the same purpose as painting and decorating which are covered by the
D-B Act.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15d13 - Supply and installation
contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Installation work performed in conjunction with supply
or service (e.g., base support) contracts is covered by the DBRA where it
involves more than an incidental amount of construction activity (i.e., the
contract contains specific requirements for substantial amounts of
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or repair work, and such work is
physically or functionally separate from and can be performed on a segregated
basis from the other nonconstruction work called for by the contract (see 29
CFR § 4.116(c)(2)). For example, D‑B coverage has been extended to installing a
security system or an intrusion detection system, installing permanent shelving
which is attached to a structure, installing air-conditioning ducts, excavating
outside cable trenches and laying cable, installing heavy generators, mounting
radar antenna, and installing instrumentation grounding systems, where a
substantial amount of construction work is involved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Whether installation work involves more than an
incidental amount of construction activity depends upon the specific
circumstances of each particular case and no fixed rules can be established
which would address every fact situation. Factors requiring consideration
include the nature of the prime contract work, the type of work performed by
the employees installing the equipment on the project site (i.e., the
techniques, materials, and equipment used and the skills called for in its
performance), the extent to which structural modifications to buildings are
needed to accommodate the equipment (such as widening entrances, relocating
walls, or installing wiring), and the cost of the installation work, either in
terms of absolute amount or in relation to the cost of the equipment and the
total project cost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
DBRA does not apply to
construction work which is incidental to the furnishing of supplies or
equipment, if the construction work is so merged with nonconstruction work or
so fragmented in terms of the locations or time spans of its performance that
the construction work is not capable of being segregated as a separate
contractual requirement.<br />
</p>
<h3>15e - INTERPRETATIONS - APPLICATION OF DBRA TO TYPES OF EMPLOYEES</h3>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e00 - Definition of laborers and
mechanics.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The terms “laborer” and
“mechanic” are defined in 29 CFR § 5.2(m), and generally include workers whose
duties are manual or physical in nature as distinguished from mental or
managerial, and include apprentices, trainees, and helpers. (In the case of
CWHSSA, see FOH 15j00.) The terms do not apply to workers whose duties are
primarily administrative, executive, professional, or clerical, rather than
manual (see also FOH l5e15). Generally, mechanics are considered to include any
worker who uses tools, or who is performing the work of a trade. The DBA
requires payment of the applicable prevailing wage rate to all laborers and
mechanics “regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to
exist.”</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e01 - Apprentices.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An apprentice (29 CFR § 5.2(n)(l)) is (1) any person
employed under a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State
apprenticeship agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor,
Employment and Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship Training,
Employer and Labor Services (OA), or if no such recognized agency exists in a
State, under a program registered with the OA itself, or, (2) a person in the
first 90 days of probationary employment as an apprentice in such an approved
apprenticeship program who is not individually registered in the program, but
who has been certified by OA or a State apprenticeship agency (as appropriate)
to be eligible for probationary employment as an apprentice. All apprentices
other than probationary apprentices must be individually registered in the
approved program. Consistent with the level of training in the program, an
apprentice will perform for the appropriate period of time all levels of work,
from the lowest unskilled laborer’s work to the highest skilled or craft work
of the finished mechanic, under the supervision of the journeyworker. To be
employed in compliance with the Regulations the following guidelines must be
observed:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Allowable ratio - apprentices to journeyworkers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
The allowable ratio of apprentices
to journeyworkers employed on the contract work in any craft classification
will not be greater than the ratio permitted the contractor as to the entire
work force under the registered program. (See 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i).) The
allowable ratio is to be applied on a daily basis. If a contractor has both an
apprentice and a trainee program, the trainees must be counted together with
the apprentices in determining compliance with the allowable ratio (i.e., the
journeyworkers may not be counted twice).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
For the purpose of illustration
only, assume that a contractor is allowed a ratio of one apprentice to every
three journeyworkers under the terms of the approved plan. This same ratio
would apply on DBRA covered jobs. Thus, in this example, the allowable number
of apprentices is illustrated by the following chart:</p>
<p> </p>
<div>

<table>
 <tbody><tr>
  <td>
  <p>Journeyworkers</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>Allowable
  Apprentices</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
  <p>0-2</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>0</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
  <p>3-5</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>1</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
  <p>6-8</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>2</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>
  <p>9-11</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>3</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table>

</div>
<p> </p>
<p>NOTE: The ratios are applied in terms of whole number
increments for the journeyworkers (as reflected in the preceding chart) and not
in terms of “fractions thereof,” unless a different standard is specified in
the approved plan. Also, the allowable ratio will vary from plan to plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Recognizing that the DBRA work may
be performed in a location other than the place where the program registration
was initially made, the allowable ratio is the ratio specified in the
contractor’s or subcontractor’s registered program (see 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
A working supervisor or owner may
be counted as a journeyworker for ratio purposes provided such a worker spends
the majority of his or her time in the craft, at the site.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5) 
In determining the proper ratios,
“bootstrapping” is not allowed. For example, if an employer has employees who
are misclassified and determined to be entitled to the journeyworker’s rate or
has utilized an excessive number of apprentices who are also entitled to the
journeyworker’s rate, such employees cannot then be counted as “journeyworker”
for ratio purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Registered apprentice ratio exceeded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a contractor or
subcontractor employs apprentices in such a number that the permissible ratio
is exceeded, all apprentices employed in excess of the ratio are considered to
have been improperly employed and will be entitled to the rate for the
classification of work which they are performing. For example, if an employer
is permitted to employ three apprentices under an approved plan and it is
disclosed that the employer is employing five apprentices on the project, the
first three apprentices employed on the project will be considered within the
quota; the last two employed will be considered improperly employed and must be
paid the full prevailing wage rate for the work performed. As a practical
matter, if it is impossible to determine which apprentices were first employed
on the project, any equitable formula for allocating the time due at the
applicable prevailing wage rate will be acceptable. For example, in the
preceding situation, it would be permissible and equitable to rotate three of
the five apprentices each week as a solution to the problem of which of these
employees were “first” employed on the project. The remaining two employees
would then be allocated the full prevailing wage rate in a manner which
distributes the time improperly employed as equally as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Evidence of bona fide apprenticeship registration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR § 5.5(a)(3)(i)
requires that a contractor or subcontractor utilizing apprentices maintain
written evidence of the registration of the program and the apprentices, and of
the ratios and wage rates prescribed in the applicable programs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Unregistered apprentices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i)
provides that any employee listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate who
is not a bona fide registered or probationary apprentice must be paid the wage
rate for the classification of work actually performed. However, the fact that
a worker is listed on the payrolls as an apprentice in a particular craft and
paid an apprentice wage rate for that craft does not, in itself, mean that
person performed only the work of, or used only the tools of, the craft in
which the person is an unregistered apprentice, and it does not mean that the
worker must be compensated only at the contract rate for that craft
classification. Such an employee may actually be performing work as a laborer
or in another craft classification, and must receive at least the rate
applicable for the classification(s) of work actually performed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Employment of apprentices by more than one employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employment of a properly
registered apprentice by more than one employer does not affect his/her status.
The transfer of apprentices from one employer to another to provide varied work
and training is an accepted construction industry practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Wage computations for apprentices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In some instances, bona fide
apprenticeship programs contain percentages which are applied to a stipulated
wage rate (e.g., stated in the approved apprenticeship program or set forth in
a collective bargaining agreement), the product of which results in the wage
rate paid to the apprentice. While such a computation is acceptable on
construction projects not subject to the DBRA, the contractor on covered
projects is bound by any higher wage rates in the WD and the percentages should
be computed against the journeyworker’s basic rate found in the WD. Some
apprenticeship agreements may specify dollar amounts, rather than percentages
of the journeyworker’s rate, for various levels of progress. For this type of
apprenticeship training program, in order to determine whether the apprentice
is properly paid it is necessary to convert the dollar amounts to a percentage
of the journeyworker’s basic rate in the training program. This is then applied
to the rate specified in the WD. For example, where the journeyworker’s rate
contained in the apprenticeship training program for a particular craft is
$16.00 per hour and the apprentices are to receive $8.00, $10.00, $12.00, or
$14.00, depending on their level of progress, the percentages to be applied against
the journeyworker’s rate in the WD should be 50%, 63%, 75%, and 88%,
respectively. In addition, the apprentices are also entitled to receive fringe
benefits in accordance with the provisions of the apprenticeship program. If
the approved program is silent as to fringe benefits, apprentices must be paid
the full amount of fringe benefits listed in the WD for their classification,
unless the Administrator determines that a different practice prevails in the
locality of the construction project for that particular apprentice
classification.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e02 - Trainees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   A trainee (29 CFR § 5.2(n)(2)) is any person who is
receiving on-the-job training in a construction occupation under a program
which has received prior approval (or prior recognition for certain programs
established prior to August 20, 1975), as evidenced by formal certification of
the approval (or recognition) by the Department’s Employment and Training
Administration (OA). State apprenticeship agencies have no authority over
trainee programs. (See 29 CFR §§ 5.2(n), 5.5(a)(4)(ii), 5.16, and 5.17.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  A trainee must be paid at the rate specified in the
program for his/her level of progress, expressed as a percentage of the
journeyworker hourly rate specified in the applicable WD. Also, trainees are to
be paid the fringe benefits stipulated in the trainee program. If the program
does not mention fringe benefits, trainees must receive the fringe benefits
reflected on the WD for the craft. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>NOTE: An exception to this
rule applies if the Administrator determines that there is a corresponding
apprenticeship program providing for less than full fringe benefits for
apprentices in that particular classification, in which case fringe benefits
must be paid trainees in accordance with the corresponding apprenticeship
program. 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(ii).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The principles set forth in FOH 15e0l regarding
allowable ratio, ratio exceeded, evidence of apprenticeship, unregistered
apprentices, employment by more than one employer, and wage computations for
apprentices are applicable to trainees. (Exception: Portability 15e01(b)(3)
does not apply to trainees.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  A contractor employing participants under the
Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (which superseded the Job Training
Partnership Act and amended the Wagner-Peyser Act) on a DBRA covered contract
must pay such individuals the applicable prevailing wage rate for the
classification of work performed unless the requirements in 29 CFR §
5.5(a)(4)(ii) have been met and the particular training program has been
approved by ETA (OA).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   There are a number of ETA on-the-job training programs
(for example, the Step-up program) established to train and hire the
unemployed. Unless the requirements of 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4) are met, individuals
enrolled in such programs must be paid the applicable prevailing wage rate for
the classification of work performed on covered DBRA work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   The requirements of 29 CFR §§ 5.5(a)(4)(i) and (ii) do
not apply to apprentices and trainees performing on Federal-aid highway
construction contracts subject to 23 U.S.C § 113 and enrolled in programs
certified by the Secretary of DOT, because they are specifically exempted from
DBRA by the Federal-Aid Highway Act. See 23 U.S.C § 113(c).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e03 - Summer youth employment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Under the guidelines set forth in All Agency Memoranda
# 71 and 96, DOL will take no exception to the practice of paying less than the
predetermined laborer or journeyworker’s rate to bona fide students employed on
a temporary basis for the summer months only if the employment is part of a
bona fide youth opportunity program such as that sponsored by union and
management or by a governmental or community group. Also, such employment must
be in accordance with statutory age and minimum wage requirements. Sponsorship
by an individual contractor for only one particular project would not qualify
for the exception.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The specific provisions of any such agreement between
the contractor and the contracting agency and the rates of pay are to be in writing,
and a report of the reclassification is to be submitted to the Administrator by
the contracting agency.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e04 - Federal youth and student
programs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Section 4 of the Davis-Bacon
Act provides that the statute “does not supersede or impair any authority
otherwise granted by federal law to provide for the establishment of specific
wage rates.” The authorizing statutes for the Youth Conservation Corps, 16 U.S.C.
§ 1703(a)(3), and the Public Land Corps, 16 U.S.C. § 1726, for example,
specifically require the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture to set the
rates of pay or living allowances for the Corps’ participants. <a name="[FN1]I949B86E0591811DC9A7991B831129164"></a><a name="I949BADF0591811DC9A7991B831129164"></a><a name="I9498EED6591811DC9A7991B831129164"></a><a name="SP;0bd500007a412"></a>Other
youth programs, such as the American Conservation and Youth Service Corps
(AmeriCorps), 42 U.S.C. § 12655l, and Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA),
42 U.S.C. § 4955, specify in the statutory language the living allowances and
other benefits that must be provided to each participant. In accordance with
section 4 of the Davis-Bacon Act, participants in federal youth programs that
establish specific compensation to be given participants would not be covered
by Davis-Bacon labor standards.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e05 - Helpers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The term helper is defined in
29 CFR § 5.2(n)(4), Helpers are permitted on a DBRA contract only if the helper
classifications are specified in the applicable WD or conformed rates are
approved pursuant to 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(l)(ii). Helper classifications will be
issued or approved only where the helper classification in question constitutes
a separate and distinct class of worker whose use is prevailing in the area,
and whose scope of duties does not overlap those of another classification
(journeyworker or laborer). A helper may not be used as an informal apprentice
or trainee, and it is not permissible for helpers to use “tools of the trade”
in assisting a journeyworker. (See 65 FR 69674, Nov. 20, 2000.)</p>
<p>            </p>

<h3>15e06 - Air balance engineers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In general, air balance
engineers are not considered laborers or mechanics within the meaning of the
Davis-Bacon Act. The primary function of such employees is to take measurements
and to accumulate data upon which recommendations are based to advise
mechanical contractors how to rectify imperfections or imbalances in heating
and air conditioning systems which may become apparent after the contractor(s)
have installed such systems. Generally, however, such employees do not
physically make the required corrections. If, however, such employees spend a
substantial amount of their time in any workweek (i.e., more than 20 percent)
on the site performing manual, physical, and mechanical functions which are
those of a traditional craftsperson, they would be considered laborers or
mechanics for the time so spent.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e07 - Architects and engineers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Architects, engineers,
technicians, and draftspersons are not covered by DBRA, unless they perform
duties as laborers and mechanics and do not meet the tests of 29 CFR Part 541.
(See FOH 15e15.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e08 - Convict labor.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The D-B contains no
prohibition against the employment of convict labor. Executive Order 11755 permits
use of convict labor under certain conditions, and 18 USC § 3622 sets forth
requirements for convict work-release programs. Any questions or complaints pertaining
to the above provisions should be directed to the local U.S. Attorney’s Office.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e09 - Dredge workers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Government contracts for
dredging involve the construction, alteration, or repair of “public works of
the United States”. Workers on a dredge engaged in dredging operations are
generally laborers or mechanics subject to the DBRA. However, employees engaged
in the operations of the vessel or tugboat as a means of transportation are not
laborers or mechanics. (See FOH l5e23.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e10 - Flaggers and traffic
directors.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   AAM No. 141 set forth DBRA coverage of employees
engaged as flaggers on DBRA contracts issued as of October l8, 1985. The duties
of flaggers themselves have been determined to be manual and physical in
nature; flaggers typically work on or around heavy or highway construction
projects as part of the construction crew; and their work is integrally related
and a necessary incident to the other construction activities at the site. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Employees of traffic service companies which operate
as subcontractors on DBRA projects to set up and service traffic control
devices (e.g., barricades, directional signs, lights, arrowboards, etc.) are
generally covered by DBRA. However, traffic service companies which rent
equipment to the prime contractor and perform only incidental functions at the
site in connection with delivery of the equipment are regarded as material
suppliers whose employees would not be subject to DBRA unless particular
employees spend a substantial amount of time (20% or more) in the workweek on
the covered site or sites. (See FOH 15el6.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e11 - Guards and “watchmen.”</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Guards and “watchmen” whose
duties consist solely of watching or guarding are not considered “laborers” or
“mechanics” for purposes of DBRA (The rule is different under CWHSSA; see FOH
15j00.) However, if such an employee actually performs physical or manual work
on the construction project in addition to or in connection with guarding
activities, the employee should be classified as a laborer or mechanic for the
time so spent and paid the appropriate WD rate.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e12 - Helicopter pilots.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Helicopter pilots are
laborers and mechanics for purposes of DBRA. (See FOH 15j03.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e13 - Housing authority employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The United States Housing
Act of 1937 and the Housing Act of 1949 require HUD to set and enforce
prevailing wage rates for architects, technical engineers, draftspersons, and
technicians employed in the development of a project. In addition, maintenance
laborers and mechanics employed by a local housing authority to perform routine
maintenance on property owned by the authority are subject to prevailing rates
established by HUD. Questions regarding such situations should be referred to
the appropriate HUD labor relations advisor. See
http://www.hud.gov/offices/olr/laborrelstf.cfm. However, if maintenance
laborers and mechanics employed by a housing authority are performing
construction work funded by one of the above-mentioned statutes, such work is
subject to prevailing wage standards of the DBRA (see FOH 15b06 and 15c00(c)).</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>15e14 - Inspectors.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees who make
inspections at a covered construction site to see that the work meets the
specifications and requirements of the contract or established standards and
codes are not usually considered to be “laborers” or “mechanics” for purposes
of DBRA. However, if such workers perform other duties as laborers or
mechanics, they must be paid the WD rate for the particular classification
involved for the time so spent.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e15 - Managerial and professional
employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An individual employed in a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional capacity, as defined in 29 CFR Part 541, is not
a laborer or mechanic for purposes of DBRA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  A supervisory employee who is not exempt under 29 CFR
Part 541 and who spends more than a substantial amount of time (20 percent) in
a given w/w as a “laborer” or “mechanic” must be paid the applicable DBRA
prevailing wage rate for the classification of work performed for all hours
engaged in such work as a laborer or mechanic. For example, if a nonexempt
working foreman spends 60 percent or 24 hours of a 40 hour w/w performing
administrative functions such as preparing time cards, supervising the project
work, and arranging for deliveries and the remaining 40 percent (16 hours) of
the time performing the duties of an electrician, the individual must be paid
the electrician’s prevailing wage rate for the 16 hours. (See 29 CFR § 5.2(m).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   An employee who owns at least a bona fide 20-percent
equity interest in the enterprise in which he or she is employed, regardless of
the type of business organization (e.g., corporation, partnership, or other),
and who is actively engaged in its management, is considered a bona fide exempt
executive. The salary and salary basis requirements do not apply to the
exemption of business owners under 29 C.F.R. § 541.101. An individual with a 20
percent or greater interest in a business who is required to work long hours,
makes no management decisions, supervises no one and has no authority over
personnel does not qualify for the executive exemption. To qualify for the
exemption, a minority owner with at least a bona-fide 20 percent interest in
the business must be an employee of the business and actively engaged in
management. See 29 C.F.R. § 541.101.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e16 - Material suppliers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The manufacture and delivery to the work site of
supply items such as sand, gravel, and ready-mixed concrete, when accomplished
by bona fide material suppliers operating facilities serving the public in
general, are activities not covered by DBRA. This would be so even though the
materials are delivered directly into a contractor’s mixing facilities at the
work site. Such bona fide material suppliers are not considered contractors
under DBRA. Thus, their employees are not subject to DBRA labor standards. (See
also FOH 15b04 and 15e22.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  A particular facility set up at or near a construction
site for the purpose of fulfilling the material requirements of a contract and
thus subject to the DBRA initially, may undergo a change in its character to
such an extent that it becomes the operation of a “supplier.” This would be so,
for example, if it makes a sufficient quantity of sales from its producing
facility to the general public. What constitutes a “sufficient quantity” of
sales to the general public depends on the circumstances in each case, but must
be more than mere token sales.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   If a material supplier, manufacturer, or carrier
undertakes to perform a part of a construction contract as a subcontractor, its
laborers and mechanics employed at the site of the work would be subject to
DBRA in the same manner as those employed by any other contractor or
subcontractor. Employees of a material supplier who are required to perform
more than an incidental amount of construction work in any w/w at the site of
work would be covered by the DBRA and due the applicable wage rate for the
classification of work performed. This would include warranty and/or repair
work. For example, if an employee of a supplier of precast concrete items is
required to go to the project site to repair and clean such items and in so
doing performs more than an incidental amount of construction activity on the
contract, the individual would be subject to DBRA. Similarly, an employee of an
equipment rental dealer or tire repair company who performs on-site repair work
on leased equipment is subject to DBRA if the employee performs more than an
incidental amount of work on the site. For enforcement purposes, if such an
employee spends more than 20% of his/her time in a workweek engaged in such
activities on the site, he/she is DBRA covered for all time spent on the site
during that workweek.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  29 CFR § 5.2(l) specifically excludes from the
definition of “site of the work” permanent fabrication plants, batch plants,
borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards, etc., of a commercial supplier or
“materialman” that are established by a supplier of materials for the project
before opening of bids and are near to but not on the actual project site, even
where such operations for a period of time may he dedicated exclusively, or
nearly so, to the performance of a contract. (See FOH 15b04(b) and 29 CFR
5.2(l).) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e17 - Owner-operators of trucks and
other hauling equipment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As a matter of
administrative policy, the provisions of DBRA/CWHSSA are not applied to bona
fide owner-operators of trucks who are independent contractors. For purposes of
these Acts, the certified payrolls including the names of such owner-operators
need not show hours worked nor rates paid, but only the notation
“Owner-operator.” This position does not pertain to owner-operators of other
equipment such as bulldozers, scrapers, backhoes, cranes, drilling rigs,
welding machines, and the like. Moreover, employees hired by owner-operators
are subject to DBRA in the usual manner.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e18 - Relatives.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>There are no exceptions from
coverage, on the basis of family relationship, for relatives who are performing
the work of laborers or mechanics. They must be paid the prevailing wage rate
for the classification of work performed and included in the payroll records.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e19 - Repair employees - tire
repair companies and heavy equipment dealers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An employee of an equipment
rental dealer or tire repair company who performs on-site repair work on leased
equipment is subject to DBRA if the employee performs more than an incidental
amount of work on site (See FOH 15e16(c).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e20 - Survey crews.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Where surveying is performed immediately prior to and
during actual construction, in direct support of construction crews, such
activity is covered by DBRA. Under the United States Housing Act of 1937 and
the Housing Act of 1949, the “development of the project” coverage test is
broader and may also cover preliminary survey work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The determination as to whether certain members of
survey crews are laborers or mechanics is a question of fact. Such a
determination must take into account the actual duties performed. As a general
matter, members of the survey party who hold the leveling staff while
measurements of distance and elevation are made, who help measure distance with
a surveyor chain or other device, who adjust and read instruments for
measurement or who direct the work are not considered laborers or mechanics.
However, a crew member who primarily does manual work, for example, clearing
brush, is a laborer and is covered for the time so spent.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e21 - Timekeepers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Timekeepers who perform no
manual labor on construction projects are not considered to be “laborers” or “mechanics”
for purposes of DBRA. However, if such workers perform other duties as laborers
or mechanics, they must be paid the WD rate for the particular classification
involved for the time so spent.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e22 - Truck drivers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The application of Davis
Bacon to truck drivers is based on the definition of “construction,
prosecution, completion, or repair” in 29 § CFR 5.2(l) (see FOH 15b05). Three
U.S. appellate court decisions in the 1990’s helped to clarify these
definitions and provide the guidelines below. (65 FR 80268-80278, Dec 20, 2000)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Truck Drivers are covered by Davis-Bacon in the
following circumstances:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Drivers of a contractor or
subcontractor for time spent working on the site of the work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Drivers of a contractor or
subcontractor for time spent loading and/or unloading materials and supplies on
the site of the work, if such time is not de minimis. See FOH 15e22(b)(3).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Truck drivers transporting
materials or supplies between a facility that is deemed part of the site of the
work and the actual construction site.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
Truck drivers transporting
portions(s) of the building or work between a site established specifically for
the performance of the contract or project where a significant portion of such
building or work is constructed and the physical place(s) where the building or
work called for in the contract(s) will remain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Truck drivers are not covered in the following
instances:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Material delivery truck drivers
while off “the site of the work.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Drivers of a contractor or
subcontractor traveling between a Davis-Bacon job and a commercial supply
facility while they are off the “site of the work.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Truck drivers whose time spent on
the site of the work is de minimis, such as only a few minutes at a time merely
to pick up or drop off materials or supplies. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e23 - Tugboat operators,
tugmasters, captains and deckhands.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In general, tugboat
personnel are engaged in navigational transportation, and are not considered to
be laborers or mechanics. However, for example, if a crew member on a dredging
project is performing work directly related to the covered construction project
such as connecting, extending, and controlling the pipeline through which
dredged material is being pumped, the individual would be considered a laborer
or mechanic for the time so spent and entitled to the applicable prevailing
wage rate. (Also see FOH 15j00.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15e24 - Volunteers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>There are no exceptions to
DBRA coverage for volunteer labor unless an exception is specifically provided
for in the particular D-B Related Act under which the project funds are
derived. Furthermore, DOL does not have the authority to grant waivers for
volunteer labor. (See FOH 15c00.)</p>

<h3>15f00 - Contract clauses.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   In any contract subject to the labor standards
provisions of DBRA, the contracting agency is required to include in the
contract the clauses set forth in 29 CFR 5.5 relating to minimum wages,
apprentices, trainees, withholding, payrolls and basic records, and liabilities
and penalties for violations. (FAR 48 CFR §§ 52.222-6 through 15.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The labor standards clauses in 29 CFR § 5.5 included
in a prime contract are by their terms required to be included as well in any
subcontract or any lower tier subcontract made thereunder. Contractors who
subcontract by means of purchase orders or other informal type contract forms
will be considered in compliance with 29 CFR § 5.5 provided they attach copies
of the applicable WD and labor standards clauses to the subcontract form. (See
29 CFR § 5.5(a)(6).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   When the labor standards clauses are omitted from
subcontracts in which they should have been included, and are not incorporated
by reference in the subcontracts, the right of the subcontractor’s employees to
receive compensation in accordance with the wage determination in the prime
contact is not affected. In such circumstances, since the subcontractor did not
contract to pay the DBRA rates, the subcontractor would not generally be held
responsible. However, the prime contractor would be obligated to pay the
subcontractor’s laborers and mechanics as required by the labor standards
provisions of the prime contract.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f01 - Prevailing wage rates and
fringe benefits.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The D-B require the S/L to
predetermine, as MW, the prevailing wage rates for corresponding classes of
laborers and mechanics employed on projects of a character similar to the
contract work in the area where work is to be performed. Bona fide fringe
benefits are included within the meaning of the terms “wages, scale of wages,
wage rates, minimum wages, and prevailing wages”, as used in the D-B Act. (See
40 U.S.C. § 3141 and 29 CFR § 5.2 (p).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f02 - Wage determinations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The term “wage determination” includes the original
decision and any subsequent decisions modifying, superseding, correcting, or
otherwise changing the provisions of the original decision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  There are four basic categories of WDs based on the
type of construction (see AAM#130 and AAM #131):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Building: Sheltered
enclosures with walk-in access for the purpose of housing persons, machinery,
equipment or supplies. This category includes all construction of such
structures, the installation of equipment, as well as incidental grading and
paving. Such structures need not be “habitable” to be building construction.
Examples of “building” construction projects are auditoriums, city halls,
apartment buildings (five stories and above), hospitals, office buildings,
schools, warehouses, and shopping centers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Residential: Single family
houses or apartment buildings of four stories or less.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Highway: Alteration or
repair of roads, streets, highways, runways, alleys, trails, paths, parking
areas, and other similar projects not incidental to building or heavy
construction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Heavy: This is a catch-all
category. It includes all other projects not classified as building, highway or
residential (e.g. bridges over navigable waters, dams, dredging and irrigation
projects, tunnels). Of the four categories of construction, this is the only
type of construction that can be broken into subcategories such as water and
sewer line projects and dredging projects. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A project which includes
elements of two or more types of construction normally requires multiple wage
determinations if such category of construction is “substantial” (i.e. greater
than 20% of project costs or greater than $1,000,000). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   General wage determinations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>General WDs are published at
http://www.wdol.gov.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Project wage determinations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Project WDs are issued in
response to specific requests from contracting agencies when there is no
general WD applicable to the type of construction in the geographical area for
the project involved. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f03 - Use and effectiveness of wage
determinations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   General WDs contain no expiration date. Once issued,
they remain valid until modified, superseded, or canceled. They may be used by
the contracting agency, without prior notification to DOL, in contracts to be
performed within the specified geographical area and for the types of
construction designated in the WD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Project WDs are effective for 180 calendar days from
the date they are issued. If the contract for which a project WD is requested
is not awarded within the 180 days before the WD expires, the contracting
agency must request a new WD or obtain an extension of the expiration date from
the Administrator. A project WD is applicable only to the particular project
for which it was initially requested; it may not be included by the contracting
agency in any other construction contracts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Modifications to general and project WDs, notice of
which are published in web site http://www.wdol.gov or received by the
contracting agency less than 10 days before bid opening, but not after bid
opening, are effective unless the agency finds there is not sufficient time to
notify bidders of the change. (See 29 CFR § 1.6(c).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  In addition, 29 CFR § 1.6(c)(3)(iv) provides that if a
contract to which a general WD has been applied is not awarded within 90 days
after bid opening, any modification published prior to contract award is
effective, unless the agency obtains an extension of the 90-day period from the
Administrator. 29 CFR § 1.6(e) provides that if a bid solicitation is found to
contain a wrong WD, or if a WD is withdrawn as a result of an Administrative
Review Board decision, notification to the contracting agency of such a finding
is effective immediately, provided notification is made prior to contract
award. Further, 29 CFR § 1.6(f) provides a mechanism to require contracting
agencies to utilize a WD after award if it is found that the agency failed to
include any WD in a covered contract or used a WD which clearly does not apply
to the contract. 29 CFR § 1.6(g) contains guidelines for the application of WDs
in situations where Federal funding or assistance is not approved until after
contract award (or after start of construction where there is no contract
award).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Project or general WDs included in a contract are
effective for the life of the contract. However, contracts that contain Option
Clauses by which a contracting agency may unilaterally extend the term of the
contract require inclusion of a current WD at the time the option is exercised.
(AAM # 157).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f04 - Payrolls and reporting
requirements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Payrolls and basic records
relating thereto must be maintained and preserved as required by 29 CFR §
5.5(a)(3) and 48 CFR §§ 52.222-8. Regulations 29 CFR §§ 3.3, 3.4, and 5.5(a)(3)
contain the reporting requirements relative to submission of the weekly
“Statement of Compliance” and payrolls to the contracting agency. Contractors
and subcontractors on DBRA covered construction projects must submit each week
a “Statement of Compliance” which certifies the contractor’s compliance with
the DBRA requirements. This Statement of Compliance is usually referred to as
the certified payroll record. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The contractor must submit
weekly a copy of all payrolls to the contracting agency. The payrolls submitted
must set out accurately and completely all required basic payroll information.
The payroll information may be submitted in any form desired. Optional Form
WH-347 is a Wage and Hour form available to contractors on wdol.gov. The prime
contractor is responsible for submission of the certified payrolls to the
contracting agency. Each payroll submitted must be accompanied by a “Statement
of Compliance” which is found on the reverse side of the WH-347. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The contractor or
subcontractor must make the payroll records available for inspection, copying,
or transcription by authorized representatives of the contracting agency or the
Department of Labor and must permit these representatives to interview workers
during working hours on the job. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the contractor or
subcontractor fails to submit the required records or to make them available,
the federal agency may, after written notice to the contractor, take such
action as is necessary to cause suspension of any further payment, advance or
guarantee of funds. Failure to submit the required records upon request or to
make such records available may be grounds for debarment action.</p>

<h3>15f05 - Area practice - determining
proper classification of various work and type of construction.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   To determine the proper classification of work
performed on a Davis-Bacon covered project, it may be necessary to conduct a local
area practice survey. Under the DBA, there are not standard classification
definitions. (This differs from SCA classifications, which are defined in the
SCA Directory of Classifications.) Note: While the Dictionary of Occupational
Titles, published by the Department’s Employment and Training Administration,
may be used as reference material, it cannot be relied on for making employee
classification determinations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The Wage Appeals Board ruled in Fry Brothers Corp.
(WAB Case No. 76-6, June 14, 1977) that the proper classification of work
performed by laborers and mechanics is that classification used by firms whose
wage rates were found to be prevailing in the area and incorporated in the
applicable wage determination. Questions as to the proper classification for
the work performed by a laborer or mechanic are resolved by making an area
practice survey. Area practice surveys can be conducted by the contracting
agencies or by WHD using the following guidelines. All Agency Memorandums
(AAMs) Nos. 130 and 131 provide guidance regarding the proper categories of the
various types of construction (building, heavy, highway and residential)
subject to “local or area practice”. Before any area practice survey is
started, the Regional Wage Specialist must be contacted. See http://www.dol.gov/whd/programs/dbra/regions.htm</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Basic Principles/Preliminary Steps for Conducting
Surveys to Determine Prevailing Local Area Practice:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Clearly define the scope of
work/duties for which proper classification is at issue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Refer to the wage determination in
the DB/DBRA covered contract.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Determine what classifications may
perform the work duties in question.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
Examine the “identifiers” for each
classification to determine whether the rates in the wage determination for
each such classification reflect union negotiated or non-union wages. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     Non-union rates in a Davis-Bacon wage determination
are listed in a wage rate block that has an “SU” identifier, and appear in
alphabetical order in the list of classifications in the wage determination
(e.g,. after sheet metal workers and before truck drivers). Other wage
determination blocks reflect rates in collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     Union rates are listed under identifiers that refer to
the union whose rates are reflected in a given wage rate block in the
Davis-Bacon wage determination. Examples are: ASBE (International Association
of Heat &amp; Frost &amp; Asbestos Workers), ELEC (International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers), PLAS (Operative Plasters and Cement Masons), and PLUM
(United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe
Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada). The number following in the
identifier usually indicates the local union number for the union that
negotiated the rates shown in the wage determination block.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5) 
In accord with Fry Brothers Corp.,
information to be considered in the area practice survey is from firms whose
wage rates were found to be prevailing in the area and incorporated in the
applicable wage determination.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     If, in the applicable wage determination, the rates
listed for all the classifications that may perform the work in question are
non-union rates, the dispute will be resolved by examining the practice(s) of
non-union contractors in classifying workers performing the duties on similar
construction in question in the area (usually the same county).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     If, in the applicable wage determination, the rates
listed for all the classifications that may perform the work in question are
union rates, the dispute will be resolved by examining the practice(s) of union
contractors in classifying workers performing the duties in question on similar
construction in the area (usually the same county). (Often such questions can
be resolved by a limited area practice survey.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     If a combination of union and non-union rates are
listed in the wage determination for classifications that may have performed
the work in question on similar construction in the area (usually the same
county), the dispute will be resolved based on the combined information from:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
union contractors for the
classification(s) for which union rate(s) are listed in the applicable wage
determination; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
non-union contractors for the
classification(s) for which non-union rate(s) are listed in the applicable wage
determination.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6) 
To ensure the local area practice
survey examines how workers who performed the duties in question were
classified when they worked on similar construction projects in the same area
as the project in question during the survey timeframe, proper classification
of the laborers or mechanics performing the work in question will be resolved
by examining the classification practice(s) of contractors who performed the
work in question on:</p>
<p>                                             
a.     similar construction projects – building construction,
residential construction, highway construction, heavy construction – (See AAM
# 130 &amp; 131.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     that were in progress in the same area (normally the
same county.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     during the year preceding the contract in question (as
discussed below).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7) 
The extent of the information
required for making area practice determinations will depend on the facts in
each case. For example:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     If, in gathering preliminary data, all of the parties
agree as to the proper classification, the area practice is thus established
(i.e., a “limited” area practice survey).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     However, if all parties do not agree (i.e.,
jurisdictional dispute between two unions, or management does not agree with
the union, or where non-union rate(s) in the wage determination may apply and
the practice among non-union contractors in the area varies), it will be
necessary to determine by a “full” area practice survey which classification
actually performed the work in question.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     The survey will collect information on how workers
performing the work in question were classified on similar projects underway in
the same locality (normally the county), during the year prior to contract
award of the DBA/DBRA contract in question (or, in the case of contracts entered
intopursuant to competitive bidding procedures -- as contrasted with
negotiation procedures -- the year prior to bid opening; in the case of
projects assisted under the National Housing Act, beginning of construction or
the date the mortgage was initially endorsed, whichever occurred first; or, in
the case of projects to receive housing assistance payments under section 8 of
the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, beginning of construction or the date the
agreement to enter a housing assistance payments contract was executed,
whichever was first.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  To conduct a limited area practice survey to determine
the proper classification of work:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Follow the “preliminary
steps” described in 15f05(c), above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
If the applicable wage
determination reflects union rates for the classifications involved:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     Contact the unions whose members may have performed
the work in question to determine whether the union workers performed the work
on similar projects in the county in the year prior to the wage determination
lock-in date (contract award date, or other date, as described above) for the
project at issue. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     The criteria for usable data is similar projects (same
type of construction), in the same county as the project in question, within
the usable time frame of one year prior to the wage determination lock-in date
for the contract in question, as established by 29 CFR § 1.6(c). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     If union contractors performed the work, each union
should be asked how the individuals who performed the work in question were
classified. If no union workers performed any of the work in question in the
county during the survey timeframe, the Regional WS should be contacted for
further guidance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
d.     The information provided by the unions should be
confirmed with collective bargaining representatives of management, i.e., the
contractor representatives. These would include local chapters of contractors'
associations that bargain with the unions. For example: the Associated General
Contractors of America (AGC), the National Electrical Contractors Association
(NECA), the Mechanical Contractors Association of America, etc. (Contact NO/Division
of Wage Determinations/Branch of Construction Wage Determinations for
information needed to contact the contractors’ association and the local union
that negotiated the collective bargaining agreement whose rates are reflected
in the contract wage determination.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
e.     If all parties agree as to the proper classification of
the work in question, the area practice is established. If two unions are
engaged in a jurisdictional dispute over a specific type of work and both have
performed the work in question during the applicable time period, contact
Regional WS for further guidance. (A more extensive area practice survey will
be required to resolve the question.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NOTE: With regard to (2) and (3), below, it may be
more practical in many instances to proceed directly to a full area practice
survey if calls to the contractors are needed anyway to determine whether each
contractor is a union or open shop contractor (see information in (4) below).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
If the applicable wage
determination reflects non-union rates for the classifications involved:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     Contact open shop contractors (many are members of the
Associated Builders and Contractors of America (ABC)) and ask whether they
performed the work in question on similar projects underway in the county
during the survey timeframe. (While it may not be possible to know if
contractors are union or open shop contractors prior to calling them, there
would be no need to request information from the union contractors concerning
their classification practices in this case.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
If so, the non-union contractors
should be asked how the employees who performed this work were classified.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
If all the non-union contractors
agree, or if a clear majority of them agree, the area practice is established.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
If no open shop contractor
performed the work at issue in the county during the survey timeframe, contact
the Regional WS for further guidance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
If the applicable wage
determination reflects a mix of union and non-union rates for the
classifications involved:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     Contact the unions, and contact union and open shop
contractors (and/or their associations) to determine who performed the work at
issue on similar projects during the survey timeframe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
If all parties agree, or if a
clear majority of the parties (both union contractors regarding the classification
listed with a union rate in the wage determination and non-union contractors
regarding the classification listed with a non-union rate in the wage
determination) agree on the classification, the area practice is established.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
Contact the Regional WS if no work
of the type at issue was performed in the county during the applicable time
frame discussed above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
For any type of wage determination
(whether based on union rates, non-union rates, or a mixed schedule): If the
parties contacted in the limited area practice survey do not agree (i.e.,
jurisdictional dispute between the unions, management does not agree with union,
or disagreement between the open shop contractors), or if there is no clear
majority in agreement, then it is necessary to contact the Regional WS and
prepare to conduct a full area practice survey.</p>
<p>(e)   How to conduct a full area practice survey to
determine the proper classification of work:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Follow the “preliminary steps” described in 15f05(c),
above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Identify similar projects in the same
geographical area as the project under investigation (usually the county) which
were in progress during the period one year prior to the wage determination
lock-in date of the contract involved in the dispute/investigation. If no
similar projects were built in the area during that time frame, contact the
Regional WS for advice in expanding the survey's geographic scope and/or its
time frame. (Note: where data regarding the classification practices of union
contractors are sought in the area practice survey, it may be appropriate to
request a list of contractors who may have performed the work in question from
the relevant union(s) and use such list(s) to contact the contractors as a way
to identify relevant projects.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Identify firms that performed the work
in question on these projects and determine those from which data should be
collected based on whether the relevant classifications in question in the wage
determination are either non-union rates, union rates, or both. (For example, if
only non-union wage rates in the wage determination are involved, information
from union contractors is not relevant; if only union rates are involved,
information from open shop contractors is not relevant. Similarly, if the
classifications in the wage determination that may have performed the work in
question are a mix of union and non-union rates, information from both union
and open shop contractors will need to be collected, but data from union
contractors cannot be used to support the non-union rate and data from open
shop contractors cannot be used to support the union classification rate.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
For each project, obtain data from
the week in which the greatest number of employees performed the work in
question, and record how many performed such work on each project and how such
employees were classified and paid.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
Compile all relevant information
received and total the number of employees who performed the work in question
in each classification reported. The data should be tallied separately for
union and non-union contractors/workers – only data from union
contractors/workers can be counted to support a union rate listed in the
contract wage determination, and only data from open shop contractors can be
counted to support a non-union rate in the wage determination.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     The classification which has the clear majority of
employees performing the work in question is the proper classification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     If the data does not show that at least 60% of the
workers who performed the duties in question were classified in the same classification,
contact the Regional WS for further guidance.</p>

<h3>15f06 - Business Owners.</h3>
<p>            </p>
<p>An employee who owns at
least a bona fide 20-percent equity interest in the enterprise in which
employed, regardless of the type of business organization (e.g., corporation,
partnership, or other), and who is actively engaged in its management, is
considered a bona fide exempt executive. The salary and salary basis
requirements do not apply to the exemption of business owners under 29 C.F.R. §
541.101. An individual with a 20 percent or greater interest in a business who
is required to work long hours, makes no management decisions, supervises no
one and has no authority over personnel does not qualify for the executive
exemption. To qualify for the exemption, a minority owner with at least a
bona-fide 20 percent interest in the business must be actively engaged in
management. See 29 C.F.R. § 541.101.</p>

<h3>15f07 - Discharging MW and FB
obligations under DBRA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   A contractor or subcontractor performing work subject
to a DBRA wage determination may discharge its MW obligations for the payment
of both straight time wages and fringe benefits by (1) paying both in cash, (2)
making payments or incurring costs for “bona fide” fringe benefits, or, (3) by
a combination thereof. Thus, under the DBRA (unlike SCA) a contractor may
offset an amount of monetary wages paid in excess of the MW required under the
determination to satisfy its fringe benefit obligations. (See 40 U.S.C. §
3142(d) and 29 CFR Part 5.31.) This may be done, for example, in the following
ways:</p>

<p>(b)  Regulation of payroll deductions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
29 CFR § 3.5 permits the following
deductions from wages without the approval of the Secretary of Labor. (See 29
CFR § 3.5 for further detail.) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     Deductions for social security or federal or state
income tax withholding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     Deductions for bona fide prepayment of wages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     Deductions for court ordered payments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
d.     Deductions for contributions to fringe benefit plans,
provided that the deduction is not prohibited by law, that it is either
voluntarily consented to by the employee in writing in advance of the time the
work is done or provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, that no
profit or other benefit is obtained by the contractor, and that the deduction
serves the convenience of the employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
e.     Deductions for purchase of U.S. savings bonds when
voluntarily authorized by the employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
f.     Deductions to repay loans or to purchase shares in a
credit union.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
g.     Deductions voluntarily authorized for contributions to
organizations such as the Red Cross, United Way, or similar charitable
organizations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
h.     Deductions to pay union initiation fees and membership
dues, not including fines or special assessments, provided that a collective
bargaining agreement provides for such deductions and the deductions are not
otherwise prohibited by law.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                              
i.     Deductions for the “reasonable cost” of board,
lodging, or other facilities meeting the requirements of section 3(m) of FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                              
j.     Deductions for the cost of safety equipment purchased
by the employee if such equipment is not required by law to be furnished by the
employer, if such deduction is not prohibited by FLSA or other law, and if the
cost on which the deduction is based does not exceed the actual cost to the
employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Pursuant to 29 CFR § 3.6, any
contractor may apply to the Secretary of Labor for permission to make any
deductions not permitted under 29 CFR § 3.5. The Secretary of Labor may approve
payroll deductions whenever all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     The contractor does not make a profit or benefit
directly or indirectly from the deduction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
b.     The deduction is not otherwise prohibited by law.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     Either the employee voluntarily consented to the
deduction in writing in advance of the time the DBA/DBRA work is performed or
the deduction is provided under the terms of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            
d.     The deduction serves the convenience and interest of
the employee.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f08 - Salaried employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In many cases salaried
employees perform work on DBRA covered projects and noncovered projects in the
same w/w. To determine whether the employee has been properly paid for the time
spent on the DBRA project, it is first necessary to determine the hourly rate
of pay. For example, an employee who is working 40 hours per week and paid a salary
of $600.00 per week would be paid at the rate of $15.00 per hour. If this same
employee is entitled to a prevailing rate of $19.50 per hour for DBRA covered
work, he or she would be entitled to an additional $4.50 per hour for work
performed on the DBRA project. An employer may not arbitrarily allocate a
greater portion of the employee’s salary to DBRA work in order to achieve
compliance with the Act. It should be kept in mind that a nonexempt (i.e., 29
CFR Part 541) salaried employee is only due the applicable DBRA rate for those
hours actually spent performing laborers’ and mechanics’ duties. (See 29 CFR §
5.2(m) and FOH 15e15(b).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f09 - Hourly paid employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The same type of problem as
discussed in FOH 15f08 may be encountered with regard to hourly paid employees
working on DBRA covered work and noncovered work in the same w/w. The
contractor may not arbitrarily change the employee’s hourly wages to meet its
DBRA obligations. For example, assume an employee’s regular rate of pay is
$15.00 per hour and the prevailing wage under DBRA is $19.50 per hour. In a
week in which both DBRA and noncovered work are performed, the employer cannot
reduce the employee’s regular rate of pay of $15.00 per hour on nongovemment
work to offset the higher rate required under DBRA This same principle applies
where an employee performs work in more than one DBRA classification; an
employee may be paid not less than the specified WD rate for each of the actual
hours worked in each classification (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(i)).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f10 - Piece rate employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to determine the
basic hourly rate for a piece rate employee, it is necessary to divide the
total hours worked in the w/w into the total wages paid. The basic hourly rate
for a piece rate employee must be calculated on a weekly basis.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f11 - Crediting of fringe benefit
payments.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   29 CFR § 5.5(a)(l)(i) and FAR § 52.222-6(b)(2) require
that contributions to fringe benefit plans made by a contractor or
subcontractor must be made on a regular basis, i.e., not less often than
quarterly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Normally, contributions made to a fringe benefit plan
for Government work generally may not be used to fund the plan for periods of
non-government work. (See also FOH 15f12(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   A contractor must make payments or incur costs in the
amount specified in the applicable WD for each individual laborer or mechanic
performing covered contract work. Where the cash wages paid and the per hour
cost equivalents for fringe benefits together do not equal the sum of the
prevailing wage rate and fringe benefit amounts set forth in the applicable WD,
the balance due must be paid in cash to each of the employees underpaid. NOTE:
Where a fringe benefit includes a percentage, compliance will be achieved by
computation of the percentage stated times the basic wage rate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Contractors and subcontractors are required to pay
fringe benefits for all DBRA covered work in the w/w. Unlike SCA, fringe
benefits for D-B must be paid for both ST and OT hours. However, fringe benefit
payments are not included in the basic/regular rate of pay for CWHSSA OT
purposes. (See also FOH l5k06.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   A contractor may take credit for contributions for any
“bona fide” fringe benefits regardless of whether the particular benefit is
listed on the applicable WD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   The contractor is under no obligation to obtain the
employee’s concurrence before contributing to the fringe benefit plan on his or
her behalf.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Fringe benefits must be “bona fide”. There is no
difficulty in determining whether a particular fringe benefit is “bona fide” in
the ordinary case where the benefits are those common to the construction
industry and which are paid directly to the employees in cash or into a fund,
plan or program. An example of the latter would be the types of benefits listed
in the Act itself which are funded under a trust or insurance program.
Contractors may take credit for contributions made under such conventional
plans without requesting the approval of DOL under 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(1)(iv).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)  Where a particular fringe benefit or benefit plan is
not of the conventional type described in the preceding paragraph (f), it will
be necessary for the NO to examine the facts and circumstances involved to
determine whether the fringe benefit or the plan is “bona fide” in accordance
with the requirements of the Act. This is particularly true with respect to
unfunded plans, which are discussed in 29 CFR § 5.28. Contractors or
subcontractors seeking credit under the Act for costs incurred for such plans
must request specific permission from W-H under 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(l)(iv).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A contractor may not take
credit for any benefit required by law, such as social security contributions
or workers compensation.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f12 - Computing hourly fringe
benefit equivalents.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   In determining cash equivalent credit for fringe
benefit payments, the period of time to be used is the period covered by the
contribution. For example, if an employer contributes to a hospitalization plan
on a weekly basis, the total hours worked (DBRA covered and noncovered) each
week by each employee should be divided into the contribution made by the
employer on behalf of each employee to determine the hourly cash equivalent for
which the employer is entitled to take credit for each employee. If contributions
are made biweekly, cash equivalents would be computed bi-weekly. If
contributions are made quarterly, cash equivalents would be computed quarterly,
etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  On occasion, a contractor or subcontractor may offset
the annual cost of a particular fringe benefit by converting such costs to an
hourly cash equivalent. For example, the hourly cash equivalent may be
determined by dividing the cost of the fringe benefit by the total number of
working hours (DBRA and noncovered) to which the cost is attributable. Total
hours worked by employees must be used as a divisor to determine the rate of
contribution per hour, since employees may work on both DBRA and nongovernment
work during the year and employers are prohibited from using contributions made
for nongovernment work to discharge or offset their obligations on DBRA work
(see FOH 15f11(b)). Note, however, that if the amount of contribution varies
per employee, credit must be determined separately for the amount contributed
on behalf of each employee (FOH 15f11(c)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   To illustrate the principles set out in (b), assume
that the annual cost of a pension program is $15,000. The total actual working
hours (DBRA and nongovernment) are 15,000. Thus $15,000 / 15,000 hours = $1.00
per hour cash equivalent. Since construction workers often do not work a full
year (2,080 hours), where the contractor makes annual payments in advance to cover
the coming year and actual hours worked will not be determinable until the
close of that year, the total hours worked by the DBRA-covered laborers,
mechanics and apprentices, if any, for the preceding calendar year (or plan
year), will be considered as representative of a normal work year for purposes
of the above formula. Similarly, where the contractor pays monthly health
insurance premiums in advance on a lump sum basis, the total actual hours
worked in the previous month or in the same month in the previous year may be
use to determine (i.e., estimate) the hourly equivalent credit per employee
during the current month. Any representative period may be utilized in such
cases, provided that the period selected is reasonable. Where the cost incurred
included contributions for employees other than covered laborers, mechanics,
and apprentices, the hours of such noncovered employees must be included in the
computation of the hourly cash equivalent or the contributions for such
employees must be eliminated prior to determining the cash equivalent for
covered employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  In computing cash equivalents, it should be kept in
mind that under certain kinds of fringe benefit plans the rate of contribution
for employees may vary. For example, under a hospitalization plan the employer
often contributes at different rates for single and family plan members. In
such situations, an employer cannot take an across the board average equivalent
for all employees; rather, the cash equivalent can only be credited based on
the rate of contributions for each individual employee.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f13 - Eligibility standards for
participation in fringe benefit plans.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Eligibility standards are
permissible in an otherwise “bona fide” fringe benefit plan under DBRA.
However, an employer must make payments or incur costs in the applicable
specified amounts with respect to each individual laborer or mechanic
performing covered contract work. Employees who are excluded from a plan for
whatever reason and for whom the employer makes no contribution must be paid in
cash. For example, many hospitalization plans require a waiting period of 30
days before an employee can participate in the plan. Since the employer
normally makes no contribution for the employee during the waiting period, the
employee must be paid the fringe benefit in cash or furnished other bona fide
fringe benefits equal in monetary value. If the plan requires contributions to
be made during the eligibility waiting period, credit may be taken for such
contributions. Since it is not required that all employees participating in a
bona fide fringe benefit plan be entitled to receive benefits from that plan at
all times, however, credit may not be taken for contributions for employees who
by definition are not eligible to participate, such as employees who are
excluded because of age or part-time employment. Similarly, employers
frequently make contributions to union fringe benefit funds for employees who
are not members of the union. If the employee cannot participate in or receive
benefits from the union fund, the employee must be paid the fringe benefits in
cash, even though the employer, by the terms of his union contract, may be
required to contribute to the union fringe benefit fund on behalf of such
employees.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f14 - Pension and profit sharing
plans.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   In order for a pension plan or a profit sharing plan
providing for pension benefits to be creditable towards meeting the prevailing
wage requirements of DBRA, the contributions must be irrevocably made to a
trustee or a third party as set forth in 29 CFR §§ 5.26 and 5.27. In accordance
with 29 CFR § 5.26, the trustees must assume the usual fiduciary
responsibilities imposed upon trustees by applicable law. However, there is no
prohibition against the contractor being a trustee of a plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  As a general rule, contributions to profit sharing
plans providing pension benefits may not be creditable towards meeting a
contractor’s or subcontractor’s prevailing wage obligation because of the
uncertainty or discretionary nature of the contribution provisions of the plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since by its nature a profit
sharing plan is only operative if there are profits, there is no guarantee that
any contributions will be made on behalf of an employee. In addition, since
contributions under such plans are normally made on an annual basis, they fail
to meet the requirement that plan contributions be made not less often than
quarterly. (29 CFR § 5.5 (a)(l)(i).)</p>
<p>(c)   However, credit for profit sharing that funds pension
benefit plans can be given if certain conditions are met. The contractor would
be required to contribute irrevocably to an escrow account not less often than
quarterly, during the period of the DBRA covered work, an amount sufficient to
meet any claimed fringe benefit credit under DBRA for pensions on behalf of
each employee participating in the plan. Upon the annual determination of
profits, the monies placed in escrow are transferred to the pension trust fund
and used as an offset against the contractor’s obligation to employees under
the profit sharing plan. Allowable credit under DBRA would be limited to the
contributions made which cover that portion of the total hours worked by the
employees during the year which is attributable to work covered by DBRA Any
shortfall in profits which results in actual payments to the pension plan being
less than the rate at which the contractor claimed DBRA credit throughout the
year would have to be made up by the contractor when the account is settled at
year end, by paying the difference (shortfall) in cash directly to the
employees, or by making additional contributions to the pension fund in an
amount to cover the shortfall. A contractor cannot claim credit for more than
the actual costs of, or payments made into, the plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  “Vesting” is a usual provision of a pension plan which
requires that an employee must work a specified period of time before he has
earned the right to the pension benefits provided in the plan. It is WHD’s
position that such provisions are permissible under the Act if they meet the
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   “Forfeitures” are fringe benefit monies which have
been contributed on behalf of terminated, nonvested participants who have been
terminated prior to having “vested” in the plan. Pension and profit sharing
plans normally contain provisions for the disposition of forfeitures. Such
provisions provide that forfeitures are to be used to reduce a contractor’s
future contributions or are allocated to the remaining employees’ accounts. In
either case, such provisions are not prohibited under the Davis-Bacon Act.
However, the contractor may not use such forfeitures as a credit toward meeting
the requirements of an applicable Davis-Bacon wage determination. To do so
would allow the contractor to take double credit for the same contributions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
For defined contribution pension
plans that provide for a higher hourly rate of contributions to be made for DBRA
work than for noncovered work, the higher rate paid for DBRA work will be fully
credited only if the plan provides for immediate participation and immediate or
essentially immediate vesting schedules (e.g., 100% vesting after an employee
works 500 or fewer hours). In addition, if the employer wishes the plan to
qualify for tax exempt status, the amount of annual contributions may not
exceed a limitation imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
For all defined benefit pension
plans and defined contribution pension plans which do not provide for immediate
or essentially immediate vesting schedules (100% vesting after an employee works
500 or fewer hours), Davis-Bacon credit for contributions made to the plan is
allowed based on the effective annual rate of contributions for all hours
worked during the year. In other words, if a contractor wishes to receive $2.00
per hour credit for pension plan contributions, the contractor must contribute
at this same rate for all hours worked during the year. If this is not done,
the credit for DBRA purposes would have to be revised accordingly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
For example, assume that a firm’s
contributions for the pension benefit were computed to be $2,000.00 a year for
a particular employee. If that employee worked 1,500 hours of the year on a
DBRA covered project and 500 hours of the year on another job not covered by
DBRA, only $1500 or $1.00 per hour would be creditable towards meeting the
firm’s obligation to pay the prevailing wage on the DBRA project This method
for determining the allowable D-B credit for fringe benefit payments results
from the fact that employers are prohibited from using contributions made for
work covered by DBRA to fund the plan for periods of non-DBRA work, except as
stated in (g)(2) above.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f15 - Vacation and sick leave
plans.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   It has been found that many vacation and sick leave
plans in the construction industry are generally unfunded plans within the
meaning of 29 CFR § 5.28. 29 CFR § 5.28 provides that an unfunded fringe
benefit plan will be considered to be a bona fide plan for Davis-Bacon purposes
if the plan 1) reasonably can be anticipated to provide benefits described in
the D-B Act; 2) represents a commitment that can be legally enforced, 3) is
carried out under a financially responsible plan or program; and 4) has been communicated
in writing to the affected employees. To insure that such plans are not used to
avoid compliance with the Act, the S/L directs the contractor to set aside, in
an account, sufficient assets to meet the future obligation of the plan. At the
time the employee takes vacation or sick leave the monies in such an account
could be distributed and used as an offset against the vacation and sick leave
plan obligation of the contractor. However, if a contractor has paid vacation
or sick leave “out of pocket” under an unfunded plan, credit must be given for
such payments (see (d) below).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  If an employee should terminate prior to becoming
eligible under a vacation or sick leave plan, and amounts have been paid into
an account on such employee’s behalf for which the contractor has taken credit
towards meeting its prevailing wage obligations, then the employee must be paid
those amounts from the account upon termination.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Situations may be encountered where unused vacation
and/or sick leave is forfeited upon termination of employment. In such cases,
the per hour cost of the vacation and/or sick leave credit must be computed on
the basis of the total cost of the vacation and/or sick leave actually used by
each employee (i.e., forfeited contributions for which the contractor has
claimed credit under DBRA may not revert to the contractor). Of course, if the
employer pays these accumulated benefits in cash upon termination by an
employee, there will be no problem in determining the cash equivalent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  In order to determine the DBRA credit for vacation and
sick leave, the payments made by the contractor to each employee are divided by
the hours worked in the period covered by the payments. Since both sick leave
and vacation are generally annual type fringe benefits, the total hours worked
during the year (government and non-government) should be used as the divisor.
For example, let us assume an employee was paid $1500.00 for vacation benefits
and worked a total of 1500 hours for the employer during the year. The employer
would be entitled to a credit of $1.00 per hour against the DBRA prevailing
wage ($1500 /1500 hours).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f16 - Holiday pay.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The principles set forth in FOH 15fl5 regarding
vacation and sick leave plans apply equally to holiday pay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  If the applicable wage determination for a
classification listed specifies paid holiday as a fringe benefit and an
employee works any part of a week in which the holiday occurs, the employee
must receive the entire holiday pay benefit, unless a different standard is
provided in the applicable wage determination). However, if the employee is
hired by the contractor after the holiday occurs in a particular week, he or
she would not be entitled to the holiday benefit. For example, if New Year’s
Day occurs on Tuesday, and the employee is hired on Thursday, the employee
would not be entitled to the benefit.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f17 - Crediting apprentice training
costs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Costs incurred by a contractor or subcontractor for a
“bona fide” apprenticeship program (i.e., a program registered with either a
State apprenticeship agency recognized by ETA (OA) or by ETA (OA) itself) are
creditable under DBRA. Only the actual costs incurred for the training program,
such as instruction, books, and tools or materials, may be credited. Where the
costs incurred exceed the amounts set forth in the applicable WD, the excess
cost may be credited towards the contractor’s or subcontractor’s other
prevailing wage obligations, but only to the extent of the actual costs of the
program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The cost incurred for apprenticeship training for one
classification of laborer or mechanic may not be used to offset costs required
to be incurred for another classification. For example, a contractor cannot
claim credit for apprenticeship training costs incurred for electricians to
satisfy the applicable WD apprentice training requirements for carpenters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Rather than contributing to apprenticeship training
funds on an hourly basis, some contractors contribute a lump sum in advance for
the annual cost of the program. It is permissible for a contractor to use such
a method of payment and the contractor should be given appropriate credit. For
example, a contractor may contribute a fee of $900 to enroll an employee in an
apprentice training program for carpenters. In order to determine the amount
the contractor may offset to meet this contribution, it is necessary to convert
the contribution to an hourly cash equivalent. The hourly cash equivalent would
be determined by dividing the cost by the total number of hours worked by
carpenters and carpenter apprentices (DBRA and nongovernment work) to which the
cost is attributable. Since construction workers often do not work a full year
(2,080 hours) the total hours worked by the contractor’s carpenters and
carpenter apprentices, if any, for the preceding calendar year will be
considered as representative of a normal work year for purposes of the above
formula. The hourly cash equivalent thus obtained would be the contractor’s
permissible offset on DBRA covered work. In addition, the contractor’s cost may
not be offset over a period longer than the training period the cost was
intended to cover. Thus, in this example, if the total hours worked by
carpenters and carpenters’ apprentices were 45,000 hours in the preceding
calendar year, the contractor would be entitled to a credit of $0.02 per hour
($900 / 45,000) against the prevailing wage obligations for all carpenters and
carpenters’ apprentices working on the DBRA project.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f18 - Administrative expenses -
fringe benefit plans.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The administrative expenses
incurred by a contractor or subcontractor in connection with the administration
of a “bona fide” fringe benefit plan are not creditable towards the prevailing
wage under the Davis-Bacon Act. For example, a contractor would not be able to
take credit for the cost of an office employee who fills out medical insurance claim
forms for submission to an insurance carrier.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f19 - Transportation and board and
lodging expenses.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where an employer sends
employees who are regularly employed in their home community away from home to
perform a special job at a location outside daily commuting distances from
their homes so that, as a practical matter, they can return to their homes only
on weekends, the assumption by the employer of the cost of the board and
lodging at the distant location, not customarily furnished the employees in
their regular employment by the employer, and of weekend transportation costs
of returning to their homes and reporting again to the special job at the end
of the weekend, are considered as payment of travel expenses properly
reimbursable by the employer and incurred for its benefit. Such payments are
not considered bona fide fringe benefits within the meaning of the DBRA, are
not part of the employees’ wages, and do not constitute board, lodging, or
other facilities customarily furnished which are deductible from the
predetermined wage pursuant to 29 CFR §§ 3.5(j). See 29 CFR § 5.29(f).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15f20 - OT payments not required by
DBRA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>No OT requirements are
included in DBRA; OT provisions to employees subject to the DBRA will depend on
coverage under CWHSSA and/or FLSA.</p>

<h3>15g00 - Scope of CWHSSA coverage -
general.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The DBA does not provide for
compensation of covered employees at premium rates for overtime hours of work.
The scope of CWHSSA is set out in Sec. 103 of the Act. The safety standards
provisions are administered by OSHA. Except as otherwise provided, the Act
applies the maximum hours standards of 40 hours per week to any contract which
may require or involve the employment of laborers or mechanics upon a public
work of the United States, any territory, or the District of Columbia, and to
any other contract which may require or involve the employment of laborers or
mechanics if such contract is one:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
to which the United States or any
Agency or instrumentality thereof, or any territory, or the District of
Columbia is a party; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
which is made for or on behalf of
the United States, any agency or instrumentality thereof, any territory, or the
District of Columbia; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
which is a contract for work
financed in whole or in part by loans or grants from, or loans insured or
guaranteed by, the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof,
under any statute of the United States providing wage standards for such work.
(But see FOH 15i00(1).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Guards and “watchmen” and
many other classes of service employees are laborers or mechanics within the
meaning of CWHSSA. See 29 CFR 4.181(b).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15g01 - Method of procurement of
contracts not controlling.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The CWHSSA is applicable to
contracts regardless of the method of procurement. It is immaterial whether
contracts are entered into through invitations for bids or by negotiation.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15g02 - Failure to include CWHSSA stipulations
in contract.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The failure to incorporate
the CWHSSA stipulations, as set forth in 29 CFR § 5.5(b) &amp; 48 CFR § 22.305,
into a contract does not preclude CWHSSA coverage.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15g03 - Site of work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The CWHSSA has no “site of
work” limitation as does the D-B Act. For example, if an employee performs part
of the contract work under a construction contract at the job site and then
continues contract work at a shop or other facility located at a remote distance,
all the hours at both locations, including travel time between them (see FOH
15k03 (e)), would be considered subject to CWHSSA. Different wage rates,
however, might be paid as the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements would
apply only to activities performed on “the site of the work”.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15g04 - Statute of limitations.</h3>
<p>            </p>
<p>The Portal-to-Portal Act
does not apply to the CWHSSA. Employee suits authorized by Sec. 104(b) of the
CWHSSA may be subject to some other statute of limitations such as the Miller
Act. However, contracting agencies may withhold and transfer funds to the
Comptroller General in order to pay unpaid workers without regard to any
statute of limitations.</p>

<h3>15h00 - Concessionaire contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Post exchanges are considered agencies of the United
States for purposes of the CWHSSA. The fact that individuals are supplying the
funds in payment for services rendered does not preclude coverage. Thus,
contracts between Post Exchanges and various concessionaires such as barber
shops, photographic studios, snack bars, shops repairing shoes, radios,
watches, TV sets and appliances, car washing racks, operators of officer clubs,
and laundry and dry cleaning services, would be subject to CWHSSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Where the amount of a contract other than a
construction contract exceeds $100,000, the CWHSSA applies even though the
percentage paid the Government has the effect of reducing the net amount
retained by the contractor to a figure of less than $100,000 (for example,
where the contractor pays a post exchange a percentage of the amount collected
for cleaning etc, rather than receiving payment from the Government). (See also
FOH 15i00(7))</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The application of the CWHSSA to concessionaire
contracts extends to contracts under which services are provided to the public
generally, and is not limited to those contracts under which services are
provided to the Government or its civilian or military personnel. For example,
all laborers or mechanics employed by concessionaires in national park,
forests, and the National Wildlife Refuge System, are covered by CWHSSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15h01 - Contracts with States and
political subdivisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In some cases, a State or
political subdivision will obtain a Government contract and undertake to
perform it with State or municipal employees. The CWHSSA does not contain an
exemption for contracts performed by State or municipal employees. Thus, the
CWHSSA will apply to nonconstruction contracts with States or political
subdivisions in the same manner as it applies to contracts with private
employers, in the absence of administrative action under Sec. 105 of the Act
varying such application. For the application of CWHSSA to “force account”
construction work (that is, work performed “in-house” with Federal funds by
employees of a Government agency or a State or political subdivision thereof),
see FOH 15b06.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15h02 - Food services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Contracts to provide food
services to employees in Federal Government buildings and installations, or the
employees of firms which are managing Government facilities, are subject to
CWHSSA. Cooks, waitresses, buspersons, and related jobs are considered laborers
or mechanics covered by the CWHSSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15h03 - Hotels, motels, and
restaurants - contracts for lodging and meals.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Contracts with hotels,
motels, and restaurants for the furnishing of lodging and meals are generally
subject to the CWHSSA. Employees such as maids, porters, cooks, dishwashers, waiters
and counterworkers would generally be considered laborers or mechanics covered
by CWHSSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15h04 - Janitorial service contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Janitors and window cleaners
performing work on a Federal Government contract for services are subject to
the CWHSSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15h05 - Laundry and dry cleaning
contracts: Linen supply contracts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The CWHSSA applies to
laborers or mechanics performing laundry and dry cleaning service contracts or
linen supply contracts.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15h06 - Maintenance work done under
service contracts with HUD.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Maintenance employees as
well as other workers engaged in manual services for local housing authorities
pursuant to service contracts with HUD are subject to CWHSSA. Contracts with
the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) for work on houses owned by the FHA
(i.e., houses repossessed by FHA for failure of the borrower to meet payments),
such as for mowing of yards, repair, and maintenance work, are also subject to
CWHSSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15h07 - Moving and storage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Contracts which call for
packing, crating, drayage, loading, and storage of household goods and personal
effects of military and civilian personnel arriving and departing from military
installations are subject to the CWHSSA. The primary purpose of such contracts
is not considered to be for transportation within the meaning of the CWHSSA
exemption. (See 15i00(2).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15h08 - Repair and servicing of
vehicles.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Contracts for the repair and
servicing of vehicles are generally subject to the CWHSSA and are not exempt
under the open market exemption. (See FOH 15i00(4).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15h09 - Shipbuilding, alteration,
repair and maintenance.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Except where PCA is
applicable, CWHSSA will apply to the building, alteration, repair, and
maintenance of ships under Government contracts. (See FOH 13bl1, 14c06, 15d11,
and Sec. 7 of R&amp;I No. 3.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15h10 - Sorting and handling of mail.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Postal Service contracts for
the handling of mail may be subject to CWHSSA if they involve the separation
and storage of mail, as well as its transportation, according to specifications
set forth in the contract. The principal question to be determined is whether
the contract in question is a contact for transportation within the meaning of
Sec. 103(b) of the CWHSSA. If the contract is essentially for sorting and
storage of mail with transportation being incidental thereto, there would be
coverage under CWHSSA. (See also FOH l5i01(c).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15h11 - Vending machine concession
agreements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The open market exemption
under Sec. 103(b) of the CWHSSA does not include vending agreements. Laborers
or mechanics employed under such contracts are subject to CWHSSA unless PCA
covers such work.</p>

<h3>15i00 - Exemptions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Certain types of contracts
and contract work are exempted from coverage of the Act, either by the terms of
the Act (Sec. 103(a) and (b)) or by administrative order issued by authority of
the S/L under Sec. 105 of the Act. These include (the first five are
statutory):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   work under a contract described in FOH l5g00(3) where
the assistance from the United States or any agency or instrumentality is only
in that nature of a loan guarantee, or insurance (see FOH l5i01(b));</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  contracts for transportation by land, air, or water
(this includes, for example, mail haul contracts);</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   contracts for transmission of intelligence;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  contracts for the purchase of supplies or materials or
articles ordinarily available in the open market;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   work required to be done in accordance with the
provisions of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   construction contracts of $100,000 or less;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   purchases and contracts, other than construction, in
the aggregate amount of $100,000 or less. In arriving at the aggregate amount
involved, there must be included all property and services which would properly
be grouped together in a single transaction and which would be included in a
single advertisement for bids if the procurement were being effected by formal
advertising.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)  agreements entered into by or on behalf of the
Commodity Credit Corporation for storage in, or handling by, commercial
warehouses of certain items, including grains, beans, seeds, cotton, wool and
naval stores;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(i)    certain sales of surplus power by TVA; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(j)    contract work performed in a work place within a
foreign country or certain other areas. This exemption follows Sec 13 (f) of
the FLSA and its effect is to make the geographical scope of CWHSSA the same as
the FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15i01 - Application of exclusions and
exemptions under CWHSSA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The CWHSSA provides in part that the Act applies if
the contract is “for work financed in whole or in part by loans or grants from,
or loans insured or guaranteed by,&quot; the United States or any agency or
instrumentality thereof under any federal law providing wage standards for the
work. 40 U.S.C. § 3701(b)1(B)(iii). Thus, coverage on Federally assisted contracts
does not exist unless the particular statute under which the loans or grants
are authorized contains wage standards, directly or by reference. For example,
contracts awarded as a result of a grant from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, under the Watershed Protection and
Flood Prevention Act (16 USCA § 1001, et seq.) are not covered by CWHSSA since
the basic statute contains no reference to wage standards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  40 U.S.C. §3701) also provides that 40 U.S.C. §3702 (labor
standards and wage and liquidated damages liabilities) shall not apply “to work
where the assistance described in [40 U.S.C. § 3701(b)1(B)(iii)] from the Government
or an agency or instrumentality is only in a loan guarantee, or insurance”.
(Emphasis added.) This is a limited partial exemption from the application of
CWHSSA confined to work assisted only in the quoted manner. It applies even
though CWHSSA stipulations are written into the contract, but it does not
affect DBRA application under the wage standards provided in the enabling
statute. Particular attention should be paid to Department of Housing and Urban
Development projects since the assistance for many of these projects is only in
the nature of a loan guarantee, or insurance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   With respect to contracts involving transportation, it
is necessary to distinguish carefully as to whether the contract is primarily
for transportation purposes or whether the transportation is merely incidental
to some other purpose of the contract. For example, mail haul contracts are for
the primary purpose of transportation; hauling of materials by a contractor in
connection with its construction contract is an incident to the primary purpose
of the contract, which is construction, not transportation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  The “open market” exemption in CWHSSA is much broader
than the exemption in PCA. While in PCA the “open market” exemption is directed
at the mode of purchase, in the CWHSSA the determination of whether a purchase
is an “open market” one depends on the character of the products or article
purchased. If the contract is for the purchase of materials in the form in
which they are ordinarily made available to the general purchasing public, the
CWHSSA “open market” exemption applies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Laborers or mechanics (including “watchmen” and
guards) engaged in performance of government contracts for supplies that are
not ordinarily available in the “open market” (see (d) above) are covered by
CWHSSA if and to the extent that the work which they perform is not required to
be done in accordance with the provisions of PCA. If a contract in excess of
$100,000 is in part for services and in part for materials, a laborer or
mechanic performing the services may be subject to CWHSSA, and another
employee, engaged in producing the materials, may be subject only to PCA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15i02 - Limited exemptions,
variations, and tolerances.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Under the Act, the Secretary or authorized
representative may provide reasonable limitations and allow variations,
tolerances, and exemptions to and from any or all of the provisions of the
CWHSSA whenever such action is found to be necessary and proper in the public
interest to prevent injustice, or undue hardship, or to avoid serious
impairment of Government business. 29 CFR § 5.15 provides for consideration of
any written request by any Federal agency for such action, and sets forth
certain variations, tolerances, and exemptions which have been granted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  In limited instances, individual exemptions, variations,
and tolerances under the CWHSSA have been granted to certain categories of
workers on qualified contracts. However, such workers are to be paid OT
compensation as may be required by any other applicable law. </p>

<h3>15j00 - Employees covered: laborers
and mechanics - statutory definition.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Act provides that its
provisions apply to all laborers or mechanics, including “watchmen” and guards,
employed by any contractor or subcontractor in the performance of any part of
the contract work. The Act specifically provides that laborers and mechanics
include workers performing service in connection with dredging or rock
excavation in any river or harbor of the United States, or any territory, or
the District of Columbia, but does not include any employee employed as a
seaman. (See also FOH 15e00 and 15e23.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15j01 - Flight instructors.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Flight instructors may qualify for exemption as
teachers under the FLSA (29 CFR § 541.303) if the requirements are met. (See
FOH Chapter 22) Such exempt fight instructors are not considered laborers or
mechanics for purposes of CWHSSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The fact that SCA may not apply to a particular flight
training contract, or that flight instructors are not considered laborers or
mechanics for purposes of the CWHSSA, does not affect the application of CWHSSA
to other individuals employed as laborers or mechanics on such a contract in
excess of $100,000.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15j02 - Medical and hospita1
occupations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees such as orderlies,
porters, and housekeepers are laborers and mechanics. However, those rendering
professional services, and those whose work is clerical, supervisory, or
nonmanual in nature, are not laborers or mechanics for purposes of CWHSSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15j03 - Pilots and copilots of
fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Pilots and copilots are
laborers and mechanics within the meaning of the DBRA and the CWHSSA when they
are performing in that capacity. The work of a pilot requires dexterity,
coordination, a degree of physical strength, and other physical and mental
processes necessary to control an airplane or rotorcraft in flight, and does
not meet the primary duty requirement for exemption as a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional employee. (See 69 FR 22156; 29 CFR 5.15(d) (stating
no CWHSSA violations exist for different pay practices for certain pilots or
copilots under a written employment agreement, provided specified conditions
are met.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15j04 - Supervisory, professional,
and clerical personnel.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The CWHSSA does not
generally apply to supervisory, professional, and clerical personnel. (See also
FOH 15e15, 29 CFR § 5.2(m).)</p>

<h3>15k00 - OT standards.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>CWHSSA applies to laborers,
mechanics, guards and “watchmen” for the time spent on covered contract work
only (i.e., total up all time each employee spent working on covered contracts
- exclude all commercial, non-government work). CWHSSA requires the payment of
time and one-half the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40
hours in a week. (The daily overtime requirement under CWHSSA was repealed in
1986.) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15k01 - Basic rate of pay.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The CWHSSA contains no MW standards; MW standards
result from the application of DBRA prevailing wage rate determinations, SCA
prevailing wage rate determinations, or the FLSA MW. The basic rate of pay
under CWHSSA is the straight time hourly rate and cannot be less than the basic
hourly rate required in an applicable wage determination. Under DBRA, amounts
paid as fringe benefits – both contributions to bona fide benefit plans and
cash payments made to meet wage determination fringe benefits requirements –
are excluded in computing overtime obligations under CWHSSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  If an employee worked in more than one classification
and at different rates on covered contracts during a workweek, the overtime
premium is computed based on the regular rate of pay. The regular rate is the
weighted average of the rates; that is, the total earnings (except statutory
exclusions) at the different rates are divided by the total number of hours
worked in the w/w. Overtime may be computed based on the rate in effect during
the hours worked over 40 in the workweek provided the provisions of FLSA §
7(g)(1) or (2) are met. (See 29 CFR §§ 778.6, 778.115 and 778.415-419.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15k03 - Hours worked.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The principles governing the determination of what
constitutes working time for purposes of the FLSA are followed in determining
hours worked by laborers and mechanics performing work subject to CWHSSA.
However, the application of the OT provisions under the CWHSSA differs from the
FLSA in that only the hours actually spent on a covered contract or combination
of covered contracts need be considered in computing the OT pay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  In the case of an employee working for two or more
employers, all hours worked under the same contract are to be counted for
purposes of CWHSSA OT even though the employers are disassociated or otherwise
separate, such as a contractor and a subcontractor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   An employee working for the same contractor on two or
more separately awarded contracts subject to the CWHSSA is entitled to have the
hours worked on all such covered contracts combined and to receive OT for all
such hours worked in the w/w in excess of 40.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  When an employee performs two or more types of work
for which different hourly rates are applicable (i.e., different
classification, DBRA or SCA work which is all covered by CWHSSA or noncovered work,
etc.), the CWHSSA overtime premium is computed under FLSA principles (FOH 32b05
and 32h).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   CWHSSA does not have a site of work limitation on
coverage. All hours worked on covered contracts (even at a fabrication shop
away from the site) are combined for determining CWHSSA compliance. (For
example: if an employee starts the day performing covered work at the
fabrication shop and then travels to the work site, the time at the fabrication
shop and the travel time between the fabrication shop and the work site is
hours worked covered by CWHSSA.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15k04 - Computation of OT when other
premium payments are involved.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees may receive an additional premium payment
for employees performing hazardous, arduous, or dirty work. Such premium
payments are not creditable as premium OT work and must be included as part of
the basic or regular rate in computing OT under the CWHSSA in the same manner
as under the FLSA. On the other band, where the parties have agreed on premium
rates for work qualifying as OT under FLSA Sections 7(e)(5), (6), or (7) which
are computed as a multiple of the base rate specified by the agreement, the
extra compensation paid for such OT which is in excess of the statutory
“regular rate” may be credited, under Section 7(h) of the FLSA, toward the 50
percent premium compensation for OT which is required by the Act’s provision
for an OT rate of “not less than one and one-half times” the statutory “regular
rate”. A like rule applies under the CWHSSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  For example, an agreement provides for a rate of pay
of $13 an hour for a crane operator with double-time for work in excess of 8
hours/day or 40 hours a week. A crane operator works 9 hours a day 5 days a
week. Under the agreement, the crane operator is entitled to $585 (45 x $13) in
straight time compensation and $65 (5 x $13 for agreed double-time OT rate) in
OT compensation for a total of $650. The OT premium due under the FLSA is
$32.50 (5 hours x .5 x $13) and the employer paid $65. Since the employee
received a creditable premium, the employee is paid in compliance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>(c)   </b>For another example assume the same employee works
under an agreement that provides a rate of $12 an hour for a crane operator,
with double time based on such rate for work in excess of 8 hours a day or 40
hours a week and an additional $1 an hour for a crane with a boom length of
over 275 feet. Under the agreement, an operator of a crane with such a boom
length who works 9 hours a day, 5 days a week is entitled to $645 for the week
($480 for 40 hours at $12, plus $45 for 45 hours long-boom rate of $1, plus
$120 for 5 OT hours at $24,). If paid in accordance with such an agreement the
employee is paid in compliance with the FLSA and the CWHSSA. Under both Acts,
the “regular rate” or “basic rate” is $13 an hour, which includes the $1 per
hour for the long-boom time. An additional payment of not less than $6.50 an
hour as extra compensation for weekly OT is required for 5 of the 45 hours
worked (5 x 6.50 = $32.50 required OT premium). Thus, the statutory
requirements are met by payment of $60 (5 hours x $12 agreed double-time OT
premium rate).The agreed double-time OT payment which is creditable (5 x $12 =
$60) is more than enough to satisfy the statutory OT pay requirement (5 x $6.50
= $32.50).</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>15k05 - Computation of OT under
CWHSSA when wage rate is higher than that required under DBRA or SCA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The wage rate actually paid
an employee for non-OT work, when it exceeds the applicable DBRA or SCA MW
rate, is the “basic rate” of pay on which not less than time and one-half for
OT must be computed under CWHSSA (See 29 CFR §§ 5.32(c)(l) and (2)). The “basic
rate” under CWHSSA is the rate on which time and one-half overtime compensation
is computed and paid under Section 7 of the FLSA. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15k06 - Computation of OT when fringe
benefits are involved.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Any SCA or D-B fringe benefit payments which are
excludable from the regular rate under Sec. 7(e) of the FLSA, or their cash
equivalent, may be excluded in the computation of the basic rate under CWHSSA,
as provided in 29 CFR § 4.182 and 29 CFR Part 5.32, respectively.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  A question of fact may arise as to whether or not a
cash payment made to laborers or mechanics to whom a DBRA wage determination is
applicable is actually a cash equivalent made in lieu of fringe benefit or is
simply part of the straight-time cash wage. In the latter situation, the cash
payment is not excludable in figuring OT compensation. (See 29 CFR
§ 5.32(c)(l).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15k07 - FLSA OT exemptions and
CWHSSA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An employee may perform work
in a w/w within the scope of an FLSA OT exemption and also perform work covered
by the CWHSSA. In such cases, during any such w/w in which the employee works
more than 40 hours per week on contract work subject to CWHSSA, the employee
must be paid additional half-time OT for all such contract hours in excess of
40 per week. However, during any such w/w in which the employee does not work
more than 40 hours on contract work subject to CWHSSA, an otherwise applicable
FLSA OT exemption will not be defeated.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15k08 - FLSA Sec. 7(f) plans and
CWHSSA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An FLSA Sec 7(f) plan which
is found to be valid may continue to operate during periods in which the work
of an employee is subject to CWHSSA provided that during those periods the
employee is paid in compliance with the OT provisions of CWHSSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15k09 - Use of the fluctuating w/w
under CWHSSA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer may compensate
employees who are subject to the OT standards of CWHSSA on the basis of the
fluctuating w/w method of payment provided: (1) the criteria set forth in 29
CFR § 778.114 are met; (2) the employees’ regular rate of pay in any w/w does
not fall below the applicable prevailing or minimum hourly rate required under
the DBRA, SCA and/or FLSA as applicable; and (3) additional half-time OT is
paid for hours of work in excess of 40 per week.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>15k10 - Computing liquidated damages
under CWHSSA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The CWHSSA requires that
“liquidated damages shall be computed, with respect to each individual employed
as a laborer or mechanic in violation of any provision of this Act, in the sum
of $10 for each calendar day on which such individual was required or permitted
to work in excess of the standard workweek of 40 hours without payment of the
overtime required by this Act.” </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>15k11 - Computation examples.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The following examples reflect the correct

<p> </p>
<p>An employee is hired to
perform work on a covered construction contract in two job classifications:
painter and electrician. The wage determination rate for an electrician is
$12.00 (basic hourly rate) plus $2.50 in fringe benefits. The wage
determination rate for a painter is $10.00 (basic hourly rate) plus $3.00 in
fringe benefits. The payroll shows that the worker performed painting and
electrical duties as follows: </p>

worked (See FOH 15k01):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this example the four overtime hours occurred on a

</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Note:   In some cases, a question arises over whether
a cash payment made to a laborer or mechanic is paid in lieu of a fringe
benefit contribution or whether it is simply part of the individual’s normal
straight time wages. In the latter situation, the cash payment is not
excludable in computing the overtime pay obligation.</p>

<p>(c)   CWHSSA Liquidated Damages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Liquidated damages are
computed at $10.00 per day per employee for CWHSSA violations. </p>
<p>Although the contracting
officer is required in all violation cases to compute liquidated damages, the
decision on whether to assess the damages is made by the federal agency.
(Liquidated damages in excess of $500 may be waived or adjusted only with the
concurrence of the Wage and Hour Division.) </p>

<p> </p>
<p>In the above example, no
overtime premium was paid. The 15 weekly overtime hours were worked on three
calendar days, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Thus, $30.00 in CWHSSA liquidated
damages would be computed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Overtime requirements under the Fair Labor Standards
Act, as amended.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Laborers and mechanics
performing work subject to the predetermined minimum wages may be subject to
overtime compensation provisions of other laws which may apply concurrently to
them, including the Fair Labor Standards Act. (29 CFR § 778.6.) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a general standard,
Section 7(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, provides that an
employer shall not employ any employee to work in excess of 40 hours in a
workweek unless such employee receives compensation for his or her employment
in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half
times the regular rate at which he or she is employed. (29 CFR § 778.101.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unless specifically
exempted, an employee who performs work on both federally funded/federally
financed projects and commercial work in the same workweek must receive an
overtime premium for hours worked in excess of 40 in the workweek. (29 CFR §
5.32 and in 29 CFR Part 778.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CWHSSA requires the payment
of an overtime premium only if the laborer or mechanic works in excess of 40
hours in a workweek on covered contract(s). Overtime hours worked, which are
not subject to CHWSSA, would be subject to the FLSA, unless otherwise exempted.
The distinction is relevant in the assessment of liquidated damages as the FLSA
does not provide for the assessment of liquidated damages. </p>

<h3>16a00 - Use of Chapter 16.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Along with Reg 870, FOH
Chapter 16 contains the Division’s interpretative positions regarding Title III
of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA). The interpretations included in
this chapter provide guidance in the administration and enforcement of this
law. Procedural matters under the CCPA are covered in FOH 52v.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16a01 - CCPA general provisions and
Wage-Hour’s authority.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The CCPA limits the amount of an employee’s earnings
that may be garnished (see FOH 16b00) and protects an employee from being fired
because wages are garnished for any single debt. (See FOH 16c00.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  WH has no other authority with regard to garnishments.
Questions over issues other than the amount being garnished under the CCPA or
termination should be referred to the court or agency initiating the
withholding action.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16a02 - Coverage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Coverage is general. There
are no specific exemptions for government employees at the federal, state, or
local levels or their political subdivisions. (See FOH 16a08 and 16a09 regarding
the applicability of CCPA to such employees).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16a03 - Geographical application.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The CCPA’s restrictions
apply wherever federal and state courts have jurisdiction. As used in the CCPA,
the term “state” includes any state, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District
of Columbia, and any territory or possession of the United States. The CCPA definition
of the term “state” is found at 15 U.S.C. 1602(r).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16a04 - Exempt States.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Pursuant to sec 305, the
Secretary of Labor has exempted certain states from the restrictions on
garnishment contained in sec 303. The list of exempt states along with the
terms and conditions of the exemptions is found in Reg 870.57. State Representatives
are listed in Reg 870.57(a). Their powers and duties are stated in Reg 870.55.
The state exemption on garnishment amounts does not apply to the prohibition
against discharge because wages were garnished for any one debt. (See FOH
52v01.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16a05 - Garnishments, wage
attachments and federal administrative garnishments distinguished from wage
assignments.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 302(c) defines the term “garnishment” to mean,
“any legal or equitable procedure through which the earnings of any individual
are required to be withheld for payment of any debt.” Generally, this
definition refers to a court proceeding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  WH regards a “wage attachment” for state,
local/municipal or federal taxes as a “legal procedure” within the meaning of
sec 302(c) of the Act. An Internal Revenue Service attachment of wages for
taxes due is an example of a wage attachment. This is the case even though
there may be no actual court proceeding involved in the tax lien or levy. (See
FOH 16c01.) Accordingly, such attachments are garnishments for purposes of the
discharge restriction in sec 304 of the CCPA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   An “administrative garnishment“ is an amount of money
withheld from a private sector employee’s disposable earnings for the payment
of a non-tax debt owed the federal government. Similar garnishments for federal
employees are called “salary offsets.” As used in this chapter, the term
“administrative garnishment” includes “salary offsets.” Usually, administrative
garnishments are instituted for the repayment of loans, such as those granted under
the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Administrative garnishments are garnishments
for purposes of the CCPA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
They are authorized by and subject
to the terms of the Debt Collection Improvement Act (DCIA), 31 U.S.C. 3720D.
For federal employees the terms are set at 5 U.S.C. 5514. These laws generally
limit the garnishable amount to fifteen percent of disposable earnings. (See
(4) below.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The Higher Education Act (HEA)
authorizes guaranty agencies for student loans to administratively garnish up
to 10% of disposable earnings for defaulted student loans. The Department of
Education may garnish up to 15% under the DCIA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
WH has no enforcement authority
with respect to such withholdings, provided they are within the CCPA’s limits.
Questions over the amount of withholding on an administrative garnishment,
where no CCPA violations are indicated, should be referred to the agency
initiating the withholding action. (See FOH 16a0l(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
When a debtor agrees in writing to
allow withholding of an amount greater than the DCIA or HEA limits, the
deductions are considered wage assignments. (See (d) below.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  A “wage assignment” is a voluntary transfer of the
right to receive wages. It is ordinarily a private transaction accomplished
through a contract, without any court compulsion. A wage assignment is not a
garnishment within the meaning of the CCPA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16a06 - Restrictions of the CCPA are
self-executing.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The garnishment restrictions
of both sections 303 and 304 of the CCPA were enacted for the protection of the
public generally. They are enforced as matters of public, as well as private,
rights and thus do not have to be raised affirmatively. This differs from
garnishment limitations of state laws framed as exemptions, designed solely for
the protection of individual rights. Such state exemptions are privileges that
must be pled affirmatively and, therefore, may be waived.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16a07 - Applicability of the CCPA to
tips and gratuities.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The application of
garnishments to tips and gratuities under the CCPA is similar to the treatment
of their ownership under the FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Bona fide tips are not subject to the provisions of
the CCPA. A garnishment is inherently a procedural device designed to reach and
sequester earnings held by the garnishee (usually the employer). Tips paid
directly to an employee by a customer are not “earnings” within the meaning of
sec 302 of the CCPA, since they do not pass to the employer. This includes gratuities
transferred free and clear to an employee at the direction of credit customers
who add tips to the bill.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Service charges added to a customer’s bill constitute
“earnings” within the meaning of sec 302 when passed on to the employee. As
such, they are subject to the provisions of the CCPA. The following examples
demonstrate the point.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
A restaurant charges a customer
15% of the check, as a service charge, and in turn pays this amount to the
server (debtor). Since this is an automatic charge, there is no gratuity by the
customer. The compensation passed from the employer (garnishee) to the server.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The employment agreement is such
that the customer’s tips belong to the employer and must be credited or turned
over to the employer.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16a08 - Garnishment of federal employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>There are only very minor
distinctions between federal and non-federal employees with respect to the
reasons for or the amounts subject to garnishment. The Hatch Act Reform Amendments
of 1993 included provisions allowing the wages of federal employees to be garnished
for the same purposes as other individuals. The garnishment of a federal employee’s
wages is subject to the provisions of sec 303 of the CCPA, in the same manner and
to the same extent as if the agency were a private person. (See FOH 52v03.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16a09 - Garnishment of employees of
states or their political subdivisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Applicable state or local
laws regulate whether the earnings of a city, county or state employee are
subject to garnishment. To the extent that state or local law permits such garnishment,
the limitations imposed by the CCPA apply. WH has no authority to enforce provisions
of state or local garnishment laws. (See FOH 16a01, 52a11 and 52v02.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16a10 - Earnings deposited in a bank
account.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A bank served with a
garnishment directed at a depositor’s account is not required to determine the
depositor’s right to an exemption under the CCPA and is not required to calculate
the amount of that exemption before honoring the garnishment. (See Usery v.
First National Bank of Arizona (586 F.2nd 107 (1978).) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16a11 - Sick and vacation pay considered
earnings under the CCPA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sick and vacation pay are
compensation for personal services, and thus are “earnings” under the CCPA. Their
status as subject to withholding or FICA deductions is immaterial in determining
whether they constitute earnings.</p>

<h3>16b00 - Garnishment restrictions for
consumer debts, support payments and federal and state taxes.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 303 establishes limits
on the amount of earnings available for garnishment. These limits are based on
disposable earnings. (See FOH 16b0l.) The CCPA sets three levels of protection
for earnings. The first category deals with consumer debts (these are all debts
not covered by the two other categories). The second concerns support payments
(that is, child support and alimony). The final level pertains to debts owed
for federal and state taxes or personal bankruptcy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Garnishments for consumer debts must not exceed the
lower of:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
25 % of disposable earnings; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The amount by which disposable
earnings exceed 30 times the minimum wage multiplied by the number of weeks or
fraction thereof worked. (See FOH 16b02.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following chart shows
the current maximum garnishment of disposable earnings for consumer debts. It
is based on the $5.15 an hour minimum wage. These restrictions do not apply to
garnishments for child support, alimony, personal bankruptcy, or to recover
state or federal taxes. (See FOH 16b00(b) and (c).) </p>

<p>(b)  Garnishments for support payments may not exceed 50%
of disposable earnings, with the following two exceptions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
A support garnishment may be as
high as 60% of disposable earnings, if the wage earner is not supporting a
child or spouse, other than the subject of the garnishment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
An additional 5% of disposable
earnings may be garnished, if payments are more than 12 weeks in arrears.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note:   The limits on garnishment for consumer debt - the
lesser of 25% of disposable earnings or the amount by which disposable earnings
exceed 30 times the minimum wage - do not apply to support garnishments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   There is no CCPA earnings’ protection in cases of
garnishment due to any debt for federal or state tax, or personal bankruptcy.
Any amount may be garnished in such cases. (See FOH 16b14.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note:   The limits on
garnishment for consumer debt - the lesser of 25% of disposable earnings or the
amount by which disposable earnings exceed 30 times the minimum wage - do not
apply to cases of garnishment due to any debt for federal or state tax, or
personal bankruptcy.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16b01 - Disposable earnings.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 302(b) defines disposable earnings as, “that part
of the earnings of any individual remaining after the deduction from those
earnings of any amounts required by law to be withheld.” Examples of such
deductions are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)       
Federal (FWT), state or municipal
income taxes;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)       
Employee’s share of Social
Security (FICA) and state unemployment insurance taxes (UCI);</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)       
State employee retirement systems withholding
required by state law; and,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)       
Federal employee retirement
systems (such as CSRS and FERS) withholding required by law. Under OPM
regulations, voluntary Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) deductions are treated the
same as deductions required by law; however, note that WH does not have the
authority to enforce these regulations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Deductions not required by law are “disposable
earnings” subject to garnishment. Examples of deductions from employees’
earnings not ordinarily required by law are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)       
Medical and hospital insurance
premiums (these are considered required by law for federal employees under OPM
regulations; however, note that WH does not have any authority to enforce these
regulations);</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)       
Union dues and initiation fees;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)       
U.S. Saving Bonds;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)       
Salary advances;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)       
Contributions to religious,
eleemosynary, or educational organizations;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)       
Board, lodging or other
facilities;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)       
Purchase of stock in the
employer’s corporation;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)       
Wage assignments not effected by a
judgment;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9)       
Retirement plan contributions
(except those required by law and, under OPM regulations, TSP contributions;
however, note that WH does not have the authority to enforce the OPM
regulation);</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(10)    
Credit union loan payments;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(11)    
Uniform rentals;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(12)    
Allowances for attorney fees
permitted by state law; and,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(13)    
Garnishment service fees permitted
by state law.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The following example demonstrates how deductions
required by law are excluded in determining disposable earnings subject to

<p>Internal deductions are
included in disposable earnings, because the employer is not required by law to
withhold them.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>16b02 - Disposable earnings in
partial weeks.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The garnishment restrictions apply in all weeks,
whether an employee has worked a full or partial week. Although the unpaid
disposable earnings for a partial w/w are subject to garnishment, withholding
for a consumer debt garnishment is permitted only if the employee’s disposable
earnings are in excess of the restriction of sec 303(a)(2), currently $154.50
(30 X $5.15). (See FOH 16b00(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The following example takes place in a state where a garnishment
writ can only capture the earnings actually earned up to the time of service.
The employer of a debtor pays on a weekly basis. The w/w runs from Sunday
through Saturday and payday is Thursday. The employer is served with a consumer
debt garnishment on Wednesday. The employee earned $250.00 in disposable
earnings in the preceding w/w, and $150.00 in the current one. The amount that may
be garnished, under the provisions of sec 303(a), is computed as follows:</p>

  </td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p> </p>
<p>If withholding for the
current w/w is required under another garnishment order served at the end of
the week, the employer will recompute the garnishment based on the employee’s earnings
for the entire week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Under sec 303(a)(2), the floor for disposable earnings
exempt from garnishment is determined based on the length of the pay period.
This pay period restriction is not prorated or reduced in the case of earnings
for partial pay periods or pay periods of less than a week. This floor does not
apply to child support or alimony garnishments (See FOH 16b00(b)), or federal
or state tax or personal bankruptcy garnishments. (See FOH16b00(c).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16b03 - Determining earnings that may
be subjected to garnishment for consumer debts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Reg 870.10 sets the maximum part of disposable
earnings that may be subjected to consumer debt garnishment for weekly and other
than weekly pay periods. Where an individual’s pay period is longer than a week
(e.g., biweekly, semi-monthly, monthly, etc.,) the earnings that may be subjected
to garnishment are not dependent on the earnings or restrictions in any
particular w/w. They are determined by the amount earned up to the point when
the garnishee (usually the employer) is legally bound to make deductions from
such earnings pursuant to a garnishment, regardless of pay period length. (See
chart in FOH 16b00(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Examples:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)       
An employee with a biweekly pay
period works and is paid the following:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In this example, $125.00 is garnishable for consumer debts.
It does not matter that the employee’s disposable earnings for the second w/w
were less than $154.50, because the employer pays on a biweekly basis. In order
for any consumer garnishment to take place in a 2-week pay period, disposable
income must be greater than $309.00. In a biweekly pay period, when disposable
earnings are between $309.00 and $412.00, only the amount in excess of $309.00
is subject to such garnishment. When the disposable earnings are in excess of
$412.00, as in the above example, up to 25% of the biweekly disposable earnings
may be garnished for consumer debts. (See FOH 16b00(a).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
A company pays on a semi-monthly
basis. Pay periods run from the 1st through the 15th and the 16th  through the
end of the month. The employer pays employees in full on the last day of the
pay period. The firm is served with a garnishment on the 17th. The debtor
employee has accrued two day’s disposable earnings in the amount of $200.00. No
wages would be subject to garnishment at this time, because in a semimonthly pay
period disposable earnings must be greater than $334.75 for any garnishment to
take place. (See FOH 16b00(a).) The employee’s disposable earnings in any
particular w/w are not material. Therefore, in those states that do not allow
the garnishment of future earnings, the employer could not withhold on a
garnishment order issued that day. The garnishment amount will be recomputed on
all wages for the period, if another garnishment is served at the end of the
pay period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The restrictions of sec 303 are applicable to the pay
period of the individual whose earnings are subjected to garnishment. Where
there is a hold-back period for wages earned, the multiple limitations
prescribed in the Statute and Reg 870.10 are applied separately to the earnings
for each pay period. Earnings for two or more pay periods are not lumped
together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Sec 302(a) of the CCPA states “[t]he term ‘earnings’
means compensation paid or payable for personal services, whether denominated
as wages, salary, commission, bonus, or otherwise, and includes periodic
payments pursuant to a pension or retirement program. ” The statutory definition
generally embraces compensation for personal services. When the employment contract
provides furnished facilities, such as meals and lodging, the dollar value of
the furnished facilities is part of the earnings and must be considered in
applying the restrictions of sec. 303(a).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   The Supreme Court has held that the statutory terms
“earnings” and “disposable earnings” are, for the purposes of the CCPA,
generally confined to periodic payments of compensation. They do not pertain to
every asset that is traceable in some way to such compensation. (Kokoszka v. Belford,
417 US 642 (1974).) Under this decision, certain lump sum payments, such as tax
refunds, are neither periodic payments, nor subject to the limitations imposed
by the CCPA. The treatment of lump sum severance or pension payments is not
clear and contact should be made with the NO/OEP/FMLA Team with the facts
involved prior to making a final determination for any particular case. It is
WH’s position that bonuses are considered “earnings” for the pay period in
which they are received, and subject to the limits on garnishment.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16b04 - Withholding taxes - required
by law to be withheld.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As specified in FOH 16b0l(a)(l),
federal, state, or municipal income tax withholdings are considered deductions
required by law, and thus subtracted from gross earnings to determine disposable
earnings. Some employees do not claim the number of income tax exemptions to which
they are entitled. In such cases WH will accept the amount of withholding tax
actually withheld, as shown on the payroll, regardless of the number of exemptions
to which the employee is entitled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16b05 - Garnishee’s attorney fees are
subject to “consumer debt” restrictions of sec 303(a).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The withholding of a
garnishee’s (employer’s) attorney fees from a debtor’s earnings allowed under
state law is not considered to be required by law. They are not deducted from
gross earnings, in determining the employee’s disposable earnings pursuant to
sec 302(b). They are subject to the restrictions of sec 303(a). Further, such
deductions may not reduce the employee’s earnings below the MW or OT required
by the law. (See FOH 16b01(b)(12).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16b06 - Creditor’s attorney fees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A creditor’s attorney fees
may be collected through a wage garnishment order, when allowed by state law.
The attorney fees are not considered to be required by law when determining disposable
earnings. They are subject to the CCPA sec 303(a) limits on garnishment
amounts. (See FOH 16b0lb(12).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16b07 - Attorney fees in support
cases (alimony and child support).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The awarding of attorney
fees in support cases constitutes part of the support award. Therefore, if a
court orders garnishment of a husband’s earnings to collect the attorney fees incurred
by a wife during a support case, the earnings are subject to the sec 303(b)(2)
limit (i.e., 50 to 65% of disposable earnings). In a case pertaining to a wage
garnishment order involving a domestic relations matter, care must be given to
determine whether the order is for support (subject to the 50 - 65% limit) or
property settlement (subject to the 25% limit). (See FOH, 16b0lb(12), and 16b13.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16b08 - Service charges deducted
pursuant to state law.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In some cases, a state law
may permit an employer to deduct a service fee each time a deduction is made.
Such deductions are not considered to be required by law, for the purpose of
determining the employee’s disposable earnings. Thus, they are subject to the
restrictions of sec 303(a). Further, such deductions may not reduce the
employee’s earnings below the MW or OT required by the FLSA or WD in the case
of a government contract. (See FOH 16b01(b)(13).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16b09 - Excess garnishment
withholdings are not wages.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Part 531.39(b) states, “[w]hen
the payment to a third person of monies withheld pursuant to a court order
under which the withholding exceeds that permitted by the CCPA, the excess will
not be considered equivalent to payment of wages to the employee for purpose of
the Fair Labor Standards Act.” Therefore, amounts withheld by the employer from
an employee’s earnings under a garnishment order in excess of the withholdings
allowed by sec 303 of the CCPA are not wages pursuant to sec 3(m) of the FLSA.
Accordingly, where such excess withholdings decrease wages below the
compensation due under the FLSA a violation of that Act exists. This is not
altered by the fact that such excess withholdings are for the benefit of the
employee, paid to a third person and the employer derives no profit or benefit
from the transaction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>16bl0 - Draw against commission.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The definition of “earnings”
in sec 302(a) of the Act includes, “compensation paid or payable … whether
denominated as wages, salary, commission, ...” WH considers a draw against
commission to be earnings. As such, the draw is subject to the restrictions of
sec 303(a), in the same manner as other forms of compensation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, for a period of
8 weeks an employee receives disposable earnings in the amount of $150.00 a
week, as a draw against commission. The employer may make no deduction pursuant
to a consumer debt garnishment during the 8 weeks, because only disposable earnings
in excess of $154.50 may be withheld. At the end of the 8-week period, the employee
receives $6,000.00 settling the remainder of commissions earned. After
subtracting the deductions required by law from this $6,000.00, 25% is
available for garnishment. The $1200.00 drawn during the first 8 weeks of this
period is not included in the total subject to garnishment. These wages
constitute the earnings subject to capture in each week of the eight week
period. (See FOH 16b00.) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16b11 - Sec 303 restrictions are
separately applicable to each employment situation.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The restrictions of sec 303
are separately applicable to each employer (garnishee), where an employee
(debtor) works for more than one employer in the same pay period. Each employment
must be separate and distinct (that is, the employers must be completely disassociated
and act independently of each other), in order for the garnishments to be
treated separately. An employee whose pay period is a week, and who works for
two different employers in the week receiving $140.00 in disposable earnings
from each is an example of such an employee. The employee’s wages are not
subject to garnishment for a consumer debt even though the total earnings for
the week are $280.00, because the employee’s disposable earnings from each
employer are less than $154.50. (See FOH 16b00(a).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16b12 - Effect of “excepted” (sec
303(b)) garnishments.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Garnishments for consumer
debts may not exceed the amount permitted under sec 303(a). (See FOH 16b00(a).)
Support garnishments are limited to the amount permitted under sec 303(b)(2).
(See FOH  16b00(b).) Once the applicable limit is reached, no other garnishment
may be made, unless it is further excepted (for example, bankruptcy or state
taxes). The following example demonstrates the principle. Pursuant to a
garnishment order for support, an employer withholds $90.00 a week from the
wages of an employee who has disposable earnings of $240.00 a week. A
garnishment order for the collection of a retail credit debt is also served.
The sec 303(a)(l) limit for consumer debt garnishments of 25% applies to the retail
debt. Under the formula for consumer debts, a maximum of $60.00 (25% of
$240.00) is garnishable. The $90.00 support payments may be withheld, because
the restrictions of sec 303(a) do not apply to court orders for support. No
consumer debt garnishment may be made, because the amount already garnished is
more than the amount that may be withheld under sec 303(a)(l). Additional
withholdings could be made for those purposes listed in sec 303(b).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16b13 - Court orders involving family
support and property settlement agreements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The provisions of sec
303(b)(2) only apply to orders for alimony, support or maintenance. A court
order for specific performance of an agreement that is truly or substantially a
property settlement agreement is not considered, “for the support of any
person,” within the meaning of sec 303(b)(l). A garnishment resulting from such
an order is, therefore, subject to the restrictions of sec 303(a).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16b14 - Bankruptcy.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The section of the
Bankruptcy Act under which the bankruptcy is filed determines if the CCPA’s
limitations apply to garnishment orders related to the bankruptcy. The CCPA
does not limit garnishment orders of courts acting under chapter XIII of the
Bankruptcy Act. (See CCPA sec 303(b)(l)(B)). Chapter XIII provides
post-bankruptcy consumer protections and remedies separate from the CCPA. The
CCPA is designed to provide such protections pre-bankruptcy, in the hope of
preventing personal bankruptcy. The CCPA limitations do apply to garnishment
orders filed under other chapters of the Bankruptcy Act. (See Kokoszka v. Belford,
417 US 642 (1974).)</p>

<h3>16c00 - “Subjected to garnishment”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 304(a) provides a
restriction on discharge from employment because an employee’s earnings were
subjected to garnishment for any one indebtedness. (See FOH 16c03.) Earnings
are subjected to garnishment when the employer is legally bound to make
deductions from the earnings of an employee to satisfy a garnishment order.
Where a binding garnishment order absorbs all disposable earnings and the
employer may, therefore, not make deductions for additional garnishments until
satisfying the first order, sec 304 prohibits discharge from employment until
the employer is legally bound to withhold for the second garnishment. Thus, in
such a case, there is no second garnishment until the second garnishment is
actionable.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16c01 - Restriction on discharge
applies to all garnishments.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The restriction on discharge
of sec 304(a) applies to all types of garnishments. The protection provided by
sec 304(a) is available even though the amount of the garnishment withholdings
is not subject to the restrictions of sec 303(a). For example, if a tax debt
results in the garnishment of earnings and there are no previous garnishments,
discharging the employee for the garnishment would violate sec 304(a). (See FOH
16a05(b) and (c).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16c02 - Discharge for non-tax debts
owed the federal government.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Debt Collection
Improvement and Higher Education Acts prohibit an employer from discharging,
refusing to employ, or taking any disciplinary action against an individual
subject to an administrative garnishment. WH has no enforcement authority with
regard to these provisions, questions should be referred to the agency
initiating the garnishment. (See FOH 16a05(c).) A CCPA violation exists if an
employee is terminated because of a single administrative garnishment. A CCPA
violation does not exist if the discharge is based on an administrative
garnishment in conjunction with any other garnishment. (See FOH 52v13(b)(3).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16c03 - One indebtedness.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The term “one indebtedness” refers to a single debt,
regardless of the number of levies made or the number of separate garnishment
proceedings instituted in connection with the indebtedness. In cases of
garnishment after judgment, it is WH policy that the judgment itself is a
“debt.” This debt may represent one or more claims of a single creditor or the
claims of several creditors who joined in the proceeding. Also, the protection
against discharge is renewed with each employment since the new employer has
not been a garnishee with respect to that employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  As provided in paragraph (a) above, there is a
distinction between a single debt and the garnishment proceeding brought to
collect it. After a garnishment proceeding for one debt becomes effective, the
law does not prohibit discharge if there is another garnishment proceeding
pursuant to a second debt. Such multiple garnishments need not be from
different creditors. They may be from the same or different creditors so long
as they involve separate debts. All of the facts in the particular case must be
considered, to determine whether there is more than one debt. Ordinarily, a
separate debt may be identified as the full amount of the debt represented by a
single judgment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The distinction between a single debt and the
garnishment proceeding(s) brought to collect it has particular importance in
states only allowing garnishment of wages earned prior to the garnishment order
being served, or that of future wages subject to a time limitation. In such states,
the judgment creditor may need to secure a number of garnishment orders to
collect the full amount of the single debt represented by a judgment. Sec
304(a) prohibits discharge of an employee under such circumstances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  An employee discharged after a second garnishment that
occurred long after the first may have been discharged solely because of the
second garnishment. As a rule of thumb, where the interval between successive
garnishments for separate debts exceeds one year WH will carefully scrutinize a
discharge from employment following the latest garnishment. A determination of
whether a violation of sec 304(a) exists must be based on all the facts and circumstances.
(See FOH 52v13(b)(l).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16c04 - Discharge - suspension,
demotion and/or transfer.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Although the protection provided by sec 304 is limited
to discharge, a suspension for an indefinite period or for so long that the
employee’s return to duty is unlikely may be considered tantamount to a
discharge. A careful examination of all the facts in a particular case is
needed to determine if the limitation on discharge provision applies to a
particular suspension action. A suspension would not be considered a discharge,
if the employee can obtain the funds necessary to satisfy the garnishment or
can otherwise secure a release from the garnishment. However, a suspension
action may be a “discharge” within the meaning of sec 304(a), if the employee
is unable to secure a release or obtain funds to satisfy the garnishment and is
no longer in pay status to enable the earning of wages to apply against the debt
(See FOH 52v13(b)(2).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The term “discharge” is interpreted to include any
adverse action that interrupts employment to the degree that a prudent employee
would look for another job. A long suspension is considered tantamount to a
termination of employment, and thus a “discharge” within the meaning of sec 304(a).
For example, if an employer disciplines an employee by a series of gradually
increased suspensions of several days duration following subsequent
garnishments on the same indebtedness, it could result in a violation of sec
304(a). Even where a suspension is five or ten days long, the circumstances may
indicate that a discharge in violation of sec 304(a) exists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   A demotion and/or transfer based wholly or in part on
a single garnishment is constructively a discharge in violation of sec 304(a).
A reasonable interpretation of the effect of transferring a person to a
position paying less money is that of a discharge.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16c05 - Filing bankruptcy.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 304 does not apply to
the filing of bankruptcy proceedings. Therefore, an employer is not restricted
under the CCPA from discharging an employee for filing bankruptcy. Section 525 of
the Bankruptcy Act contains protections from discriminatory treatment due to
the filing of bankruptcy. WH has no authority to enforce the provisions of the
Bankruptcy Act.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16c06 - Statute of limitations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The CCPA does not prescribe any time limit during
which an improperly discharged employee or the DOL must file a complaint
pursuant to sec 304. In any case instituted solely under sec 304(a), the relief
sought is elimination of the adverse effects of the unlawful action and redress
of the employee’s rights by such means as attaining restoration to the same
employment held before wrongful discharge and restitution of the wages and
benefits lost as a result of the illegal discharge. Such relief is equitable in
nature.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  In an equitable action, the employee’s neglect or
omission to assert a right is to be considered in terms of whether there has
been not mere delay but an inexcusable one prejudicial to the employer. Delay
operates as a bar against the assertion of rights provided the employee knows
of them and takes no steps to enforce them until the condition of the employer,
in good faith, becomes so changed that restoration to the employee’s former
state is impossible or where witnesses and records necessary to the employer’s
defense are no longer available. These are considerations in applying the
general rule that persons who seek the aid of equity must show the use of
reasonable diligence in asserting their rights and demanding their protection.
Inexcusable delay by the employee and consequent detriment to the employer will
generally prove a bar to the exercise of equity jurisdiction. (See FOH
52v13(b)(5).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>16c07 - Discharge may not be based,
either wholly or partly, on a single garnishment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A violation of sec 304(a)
can exist even if garnishment is not the only factor for an employee’s discharge.
Thus, WH interprets sec 304(a) to mean that only where garnishment for a single
indebtedness plays no real part in the discharge is it beyond the prohibition
of the Act.</p>

<h3>20a00 - General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Reg
526 and IB 780 contain the basic interpretations regarding the agriculture and
related exemptions. Chapter 20 supplements these interpretations.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20a06 - Responsibility for compliance by independent contractors on farms.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
it is clear that certain agricultural operations performed on a farm are
performed for the farmer by a bona fide independent contractor, the independent
contractor will be tested for coverage in his own right and considered
responsible for MW compliance with respect to his own employees. (However, see
IB 780.305(c) and 780.331(d).)</p>
<h4> </h4>

<h3>20a07 - Application of Sec 3(m) and Reg 531 on farms.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In
many instances, farm workers are furnished their meals, lodging, and other
facilities. In the ordinary case, for purposes of applying Sec 3(m) (Reg 531),
the employer may treat as wages the reasonable cost or fair value of board,
housing, fuel, and a garden plot furnished the employee. Where such facilities
as a house and garden plot are furnished to a family that has several members
working on the employer’s farm during the year, no more than the amount
representing the reasonable cost to the employer, or the fair value, can be
charged to the entire family occupying the house.</p>
<h4> </h4>

<h3>20a08 - Sharecroppers and tenant farmers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Numerous
questions have arisen as to the employee-employer relationship in agriculture
where sharecropping arrangements or landlord-tenant agreement provide for
shares of crops as rental payments in farm operations. Sample situations and
comments thereon have been prepared for guidance in resolving such question.
These are included, with an explanation, in WH Publication 1187 which is filed
in FOH Vol. I. (See also IB 780.330.)</p>
<h4> </h4>

<h3>20a10 - Effect on Sec 13(a)(6) of Sec 13(g) - "Conglomerates".</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The MW exemption
component of Sec 13(a)(6) does not apply with respect to any employee employed
by an establishment which is part of a &quot;conglomerate&quot; as defined in
Sec 13(g). (See FOH 25o.) This exception applies to employment under all Subs,
i.e., A, B, C, D, E, of Sec 13(a)(6). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  A small experimental farm operated or
controlled by an agribusiness &quot;conglomerate&quot; or a ranch controlled by
a conglomerate are illustrative of the types of situations which may be within
the Sec 13(g) exception.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Employment in
&quot;agriculture&quot; outside of Sec 13(a)(6) because of Sec 13(g) is subject
to the MW rate provided by Sec 6(a)(5), i.e., $2.20 per hour in calendar year
1977 and the Sec 6(a)(1) rate thereafter. Sec 13(g) has no effect on the Sec
13(b)(12) OT exemption.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>20b01 - "Off-farm" driving.</h3>
<h4> </h4>
<p>Workers
not employed by the farmer, such as the harvesting crew of a canner, processor,
packer, or independent contractor, or employees of a &quot;chicken
factory&quot; or hatchery, are employed in &quot;agriculture&quot; if they are
employed &quot;on a farm&quot; in duties which constitute &quot;primary&quot;
or &quot;secondary&quot; agriculture as defined in IB 780, Subpart B. The fact
that a minor or incidental part of the work of such employees occurs off the
farm will not change the situation. This is true, for example, where a small
amount of time within the w/w is spent by an employee in transporting equipment
or other employees to and from the farm or between farms, or where the
&quot;off-farm&quot; driving is isolated or sporadic.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20b02 - Field
packers not employed by the farmer.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Employees not
employed by the farmer (such as employees of a shipper, packer, or independent
harvesting contractor) are employed in &quot;agriculture&quot; if they are
engaged in &quot;field packing&quot; lettuce, celery, asparagus, cabbage, or
other vegetables involving closely comparable packing operations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  ”Field packing&quot; by such
employees must be performed either in the field or on the edge of the field
where the vegetables are grown, and without a substantial lapse of time between
harvesting and packing. Included in this term are such operations as: setting
up or distributing packing containers; sorting, trimming and washing the
vegetables; placing the vegetables in containers; closing or fastening the
containers; cooling (but not freezing) the vegetables; and loading. Operations
performed away from the field or its edge, including transportation to market
or to shipping points, unloading, cooling or reloading are not within the
meaning of &quot;field packing&quot; and are not considered
&quot;agriculture&quot;.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Where such
employees are engaged in &quot;field packing&quot; vegetables in situations not
closely comparable to packing lettuce, celery, asparagus, or cabbage, or in
&quot;field packing&quot; fresh fruits, the question shall be referred to the
Adm.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20b03 - Stripping
of tobacco in an independent warehouse.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The stripping of
tobacco in an independent warehouse that prepares the crop for market is not a
practice performed &quot;by a farmer&quot; if performed by employees of the
warehouse, even though the warehouse employs as strippers, the farmers who grew
the tobacco. In a situation where tobacco farmers and their tenants exchange
services in stripping tobacco grown by them, careful examination of the
arrangement is necessary to determine whether the strippers:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Are individually
employed in turn by each farmer (in which event they would be considered as
employed in &quot;agriculture&quot;, if the stripping performed for each farmer
is a subordinate part of his activities), or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Are employed by
the warehouse (in which event the stripping is not performed &quot;by a
farmer&quot;), or </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Are jointly
employed by the several farmers (in which event it cannot be said that the
stripping is incidental to any particular farmer’s farming operations, and they
would not be considered as employed in &quot;agriculture&quot;).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
However, see Sec
7(m) and FOH Secs 20i00, 20t00, and 20t01.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20b04 - Fish
farming.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Fish
farming is included in the term &quot;farming in all its branches&quot; and an
employee performing such activities is engaged in agriculture within the
meaning of Sec 3(f) (see IB 780.109 and 780.120). The possibility of exemption
under Sec 13(a)(5) or a combination of exemptions should not be overlooked (see
FOH 25d02 and IB 784).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20b05 - Employees
of nurseries or florists engaged in caring for plants obtained from other
growers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
In some cases
nursery operators and florists purchase or secure agricultural or horticultural
commodities, such as rooted cuttings or young plants, from others and it
becomes necessary to determine whether the activities of particular employees
in connection with these commodities constitute primary agriculture, i.e.,
&quot;cultivation, growing.. . .&quot; within the meaning of Sec 3(f). In
making such a determination it is necessary to consider all the facts and circumstances
including whether the operations performed on the plants are calculated to
produce growth to maturity or substantial maturity or whether the operations
are merely designed to care for and preserve the plants while they are on the
employer’s premises. Among the factors to be considered are:</p>
<p>(1) 
The stage of
development of the plant at the time it is obtained, i.e., whether it is
immature, substantially mature or fully matured; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The nature and
purpose of operations performed on the plant; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
The length of
time the plant is retained from the time it is obtained to the time of sale or
other disposition and its stage of development at the time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The principles set forth in (a) above
are not hard and fast rules but must be applied in the total fact situation to
aid in determining the actual purpose and result of the activities engaged in
by the employees. The following examples will serve to illustrate the
application of these principles. Where plants are received in a state of
substantial maturity and are merely potted and preserved for a short period of
time prior to sale or other disposition, the activities of employees engaged in
caring for such plants would not be considered &quot;cultivation&quot; or
&quot;growing&quot; within the primary definition of agriculture. This would be
the case where substantially mature trees and shrubs from other nurseries are
planted or &quot;healed in&quot; for later use in landscaping operations. On
the other hand, where rooted cuttings or young plants are received and require
substantial growth to reach maturity and where a root system must be developed
and regular and intensive care such as spraying, watering, and fertilizing must
be performed, the activities of employees performing such operations will be
considered as &quot;cultivation&quot; or &quot;growing&quot; within the
definition. (See also IB 780.205-.209.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20b06 - Christmas
trees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Christmas
trees, whether wild or planted, are not &quot;agricultural or horticultural
commodities&quot; as these terms are used in Sec 3(f) (see IB 780.115.).
Consequently the planting, tending, cutting, and trimming of Christmas trees
does not constitute &quot;primary agriculture&quot; (see IB 780.208).
Activities in connection with Christmas trees may be considered &quot;secondary
agriculture&quot;, however. (See IB 780-.203.) The possibility of exemption
under Sec 13(b)(28) should not be overlooked (see IB 788 and FOH 25e).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20b07 - Pine straw.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Pine straw is the
fresh, undecomposed pine needles that have fallen from pine trees.  It is
produced commercially and collected for use as a mulch and groundcover.  The
raking, gathering, baling and loading of pine straw for commercial purposes is
usually performed in pine stands or plantations, from pine trees being grown
for forestry and lumbering operations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Based on the plain language of the
statute, forestry and lumbering operations are not considered primary
agriculture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Pine straw
activities generally will not qualify as secondary agriculture, unless all the
activities are performed by a farmer or on a farm in conjunction with the other
farming operations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Since pine straw activities typically
do not qualify as primary or secondary agriculture, the minimum wage and
overtime pay protections of the FLSA will apply to most pine straw workers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
Section 13(b)(28)
exempts from overtime pay “any employee employed in planting or tending trees,
cruising, surveying, or felling timber, or in preparing or transporting logs or
other forestry products to the mill, processing plant, railroad, or other
transportation terminal, if the number of employees employed by his employer in
such forestry or lumbering operations does not exceed eight.”  Pine straw workers
are typically employed in the forestry or lumbering operations described in
this exemption because pine straw is a natural substance of trees and therefore
a “forestry product.”  See 29 USC 213(b)(28).  Pine straw workers will
therefore qualify for the Section 13(b)(28) exemption when the employer employs
eight or fewer pine straw workers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)  
The FLSA
agricultural child labor standards, allowing pine straw workers under the age
of 16 to perform all pine straw activities except operating and assisting in
operation of a forklift, would generally only apply to pine straw activities if
they qualified as secondary agriculture.  The FLSA child labor provisions for
nonagricultural work prohibit pine straw workers under the age of 16 from
employment in pine straw activities and prohibit those who are 16 and 17 years
old from operating or assisting in the operation of power-driven hoisting
devices, such as forklifts, backhoes, and skid steer loaders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)  
Since pine straw
activities generally do not qualify as agriculture under the FLSA, employers
may continue to utilize the H-2B temporary worker program as opposed to the
H-2A temporary worker program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)  See FOH 57k for the application of
MSPA to pine straw workers and FOH 36b07 for the application of the OSH Act
Field Sanitation Standards to pine straw workers.</p>

<h3>20c00 - General
provisions of Sec 13(b)(5) exemption.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Sec
13(b)(5) provides that the OT provisions of the FLSA shall not apply to any
individual employed as an outside buyer of poultry, eggs, cream, or milk in
their raw or natural state.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20c01 - Meaning
of term "outside buyer".</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The term
&quot;outside buyer&quot; as used in Sec 13(b)(5) refers only to employees who
are engaged in buying or contracting to buy, and who are regularly performing
these functions away from their employer’s place of business. The term does not
include buyers who are located and perform their work in fixed establishments,
usually known as buying stations, which are located in the country or in small
rural communities away from the main plant where the goods are processed. Sec
13(b)(5) describes an occupation, rather than specific operations, as the basis
of exemption for the employees involved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The exemption applies to an employee
who has as his or her chief duty or primary function buying, in the sense of
obtaining and soliciting commitments from the persons on whom he calls, to sell
the named commodities. Such an employee will be exempt even though in the
course of his duties he spends substantial portions of his time in such work as
driving over fixed routes and calling on established customers to pick up the
commodities, delivering them to the company plant, returning the empty
containers and delivering payment checks, and other work incidental to his
occupation as an outside buyer. On the other hand, a routeman who merely trucks
commodities is not within the exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20c02 - Performance
of work not within the exemption.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>For
enforcement purpose, an outside buyer will be considered exempt even though he
spends 20% or less of his time in the w/w in nonexempt activities.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20c03 - "Promotional
work" by an outside buyer of poultry. eggs, cream, or milk.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Promotional
work with farmers, designed to increase the amount of poultry, eggs, cream, or
milk purchased in their raw or natural state by an outside buyer, is work
characteristic of the occupation or an individual employed as an outside buyer
of such products, and would not serve to defeat the exemption. Such promotional
work is different from work foreign to the occupation, as for example the
picking up of supplies bought by the employer, or the performance of productive
work on the products purchased (other than their incidental delivery to the
employer when purchased). These latter activities are not within the occupation
of &quot;outside buyer&quot;, and will defeat the exemption. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20c04 - Outside
buyer who also tests milk at plant.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>The
work of testing milk at the plant is not the work of an outside buyer within
the meaning of the Sec 13(b)(5) exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20c05 - Employees
of hatchery who "cull" poultry on farms.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>An
employee who is part of a crew employed by a hatchery to test poultry raised by
poultry farmers, for the purpose of eliminating diseased fowls, is not an
&quot;outside buyer&quot; within the meaning of Sec 13(b)(5), even though the
hatchery reimburses the poultry farmer for the loss of the culled fowls. These
employees are not primarily employed as buyers. Their primary purpose is to
dispose of the culled poultry so that the flock will not be adversely affected.
This particular activity, however, may be exempt under Sec 13(a)(6).</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>20c06 - "Outside
buyer" may qualify as an administrative employee.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>In
some instances it may be found that an employee may be properly exempt under
Sec 13(a)(1), if he meets the test provided in Reg 541, particularly with
regard to an administrative employee. </p>

<h3>20d00 - General
considerations.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Sec
13(b)(12) provides an OT exemption for the named operations. The principles
governing the application of the exemption are contained in IB 780.400 thru
780.409. The MW rate applicable to such employment is that of Sec 6(a)(5),
i.e., $2.20 per hour until 1/1/78, and Sec 6(a)(1) thereafter, except for the
irrigation activities specifically described in the exemption which are
performed off the farm by nonfarmers. The latter are due the Sec 6(a)(1) MW
rate. However, if the irrigation work which meets requirement for exemption is
employment in agriculture within the meaning of Sec 3(f), the possible
application of Sec 13(a)(6) should not be overlooked.</p>

<h3>20e00 - General
considerations.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Sec
13(b)(13) is an OT exemption. The principles in IB 780.600 thru 780.621 are
applicable for purposes of the Sec 13(b)(13) exemption. </p>

<h3>20f00 - General
provisions of the exemption.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>(a)  
Sec 13(b)(14)
exempts from the OT provisions of the FLSA &quot;any employee employed within
the area of production (as defined by the Secretary) by an establishment
commonly recognized as a country elevator, including such an establishment
which sells products and services used in the operation of a farm, if no more
than five employees are employed in the establishment in such operations&quot;.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  WH’s position with regard to this
exemption is set forth in IB 780, Subpart H, Sections .700-.724.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The term
&quot;area of production&quot; is defined in Reg 536.3. This definition applies
to Sec 13(b)(14) of the amended Act.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20f01 - Applying
tests - area of production.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>(a)  
Reg 536 defines
&quot;Area of Production&quot;. The Area of Production chart (FOH 20f02)
graphically represents a summary of the requirements in the definition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  In determining whether 95% of the
commodities come from the &quot;normal rural source of supply&quot; during a
particular month, only the commodities arriving at the establishment that month
are considered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Irrespective of
segregation, employees who work only on commodities received from within the
specified distances are not exempt if the establishment itself does not meet
the distance-percentage tests for receipt of commodities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  In applying the population tests of
Reg 536, the 1980 U.S. decennial census of population shall be used for all
w/w’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
Where an
establishment is engaged in performing operations on two or more commodities,
one for which a 20-mile distance is specified, and soybeans for which the
specified distance is 50 miles, the tolerance of 5% applies to the combined
receipts of the commodities. Thus, if more than 95% of the soybeans are
received from within the 50 miles, but less than 95% of the cream from within
20 miles, the distance test could be met if the dollar value of the receipts of
both commodities from disqualifying sources or distances does not exceed 5% of
the total receipts. (See Reg 536.3(b)(4).) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20f02 - Area

<p> </p>
<p>Receipts
which may be counted towards 95 percent: 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Receipts
which may not be counted towards 95 percent: X, Y, Z.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If
more than 5 percent of the commodities come from X, Y, or Z, the exemption does
not apply.</p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20f03 - Measuring
distances - area of production.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The Regs specify
that the distances involved in the area of production definition shall be
airline distances. However, the extent to which a CO must go in making an
actual physical check of required distances will be governed by the needs of
the particular investigation. For normal investigation purposes, the distance
between required points may be based on a &quot;rule of thumb&quot;
measurement; that is, a roughly practical rather than a scientific measurement.
On a comparatively straight road the odometer reading on an automobile may be
used, or the distance may be determined by the scale of miles on a map.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Measurements for distances shall be
made from the nearest boundaries of the premises on which the establishments in
question are located, the nearest boundaries of the farm or farms, and the
nearest boundaries of the city, town, or village to be considered. Where some
portion of a particular farm lies outside the specified distance, the entire
farm shall be counted as if it were within the specified distance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
If any difficulty
is experienced in measuring distances where an unincorporated community is
involved, the matter shall be referred to the AA for OFLS in order that the
&quot;metes and bounds&quot; of the community as used in the 1980 Census of
population may be secured from the Bureau of Census.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>20g00 - Statutory provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Sec 13(b)(15)
provides an OT exemption for &quot;any employee engaged in the processing of
maple sap into sugar (other than refined sugar) or syrup&quot;.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The principles in IB 780.815 thru
780.819 are applicable for purposes of Sec 13(b)(15). However, the exemption is
presently limited to maple sap processing.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>20h00 - Statutory
provisions.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>(a)  
Sec 13(b)(16)
provides an OT exemption for &quot;any employee engaged</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
in the transportation
and preparation for transportation of fruits or vegetables, whether or not
performed by the farmer, from the farm to a place of first processing or first
marketing within the same State, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b) 
in
transportation, whether or not performed by the farmer, between the farm and
any point within the same State of persons employed or to be employed in the
harvesting of fruits or vegetables&quot;.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The principles contained in IB
780.900 thru 780.923 explain the application of this exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20h01 - Sugar
cane and sugar beets.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Sugar
cane and sugar beets are neither &quot;fruits&quot; nor &quot;vegetables&quot;
for purposes of the Sec 13(b)(16) exemption (see IB 780.907). On the other
hand, however, Secs 13(b)(26) and 13(h)(1)(D) relate specifically to sugar cane
and sugar beets.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>20i00 - Statutory
provisions.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>(a)  
Sec 13(b)(22)

growing and harvesting of shade-grown tobacco who is engaged in the processing
(including, but not limited to, drying, curing, fermenting, bulking, rebulking,
sorting, grading, aging, and baling) of such tobacco, prior to the stemming
process, for use as cigar wrapper tobacco&quot;.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20j00 - Enforcement
policy for computing BW when the employer is subject to Sec 7(m), 13(h), (i),
and (j) exemptions.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>(a)  
When an employer
has failed to pay OT specifically required by Sec 7(a) but could have properly
applied any of the above exemptions to the period when no OT was paid, care
must be taken in determining the extent of liability to assure that he/she is
not given an advantage in applying the exemption retroactively that would not
have been available to an employer who conscientiously applied the exemption
each week as he/she went along. For this reason, WH will be guided by the
following in enforcing the Act:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
If the employer
has available during a particular investigation period year any of the
exemptions, but has failed to post the required notice of exemption and has
failed to keep the records as required in Reg 516, Subpart B, it will be
assumed that he has claimed as exempt weeks the first 14 weeks in the year in
which the establishment engaged in operations subject to the exemption and in
which the employer did not pay OT compensation for hours over 40 in a week. If
in any of these first 14 weeks of OT any employee has worked in excess of 10
hours a day or 48 hours in week, without receiving OT pay, BW shall be sought
in these weeks for the employee for hours in excess of 10 or 48 in those weeks.
Such weeks will be counted as weeks of exemption. Of course, when the exempt
weeks are used up, OT is due for hours worked in excess of 40 in all remaining
weeks in the calendar year. (See also FOH 32a01.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The calendar year
(or period of 52 consecutive weeks) is used in determining the weeks of
exemption irrespective of the fact that some part of a calendar year (or
period) may fall outside a 2-year investigation period. While the Statute of
Limitations may preclude a request for BW for more than a 2-year period of
time, it has no application insofar as the selection of the exempt w/w’s is
concerned. Thus, if a 2-year investigation period started in the latter part of
the calendar year or period, it is possible that all (or some) of the weeks of
exemption for that year or period were used up before the investigation period
started, and no more weeks (or fewer than the specified number of weeks) are
available for the balance of that year or period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The policy regarding BW contained in
FOH 32a01(b) is also applicable to Secs 7(m), 13(h), (i), and (j).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20j01 - Selection
of weeks.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The choice of the
fourteen weeks is a matter that is within the discretion of the employer.
Exemption may be taken, however, only for such w/w’s during which the
operations specified in the Act are carried on and only for those employees who
worked not more than 10 hours in a day or 48 hours in a week, or were
compensated at time and one half their regular rate of pay for hours worked in
excess of 10 a day or 48 a week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The exempt weeks need not run
consecutively. The decision as to each w/w during which the establishment
operated under the exemptions may be made at the end of the w/w, the employees
being paid accordingly, the nature of the exemption taken being recorded on the
payroll, and a notice thereof being posted in accordance with Reg 516.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20j02 - Application
of exemption when same employer operates more than one establishment.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>The
weeks taken under these exemptions are applicable on an establishment basis,
and an employee may be subject to an exemption in each establishment in which
he works, even though the establishments are operated by a single employer.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20j03 - Exempt w/w overlapping end of old and beginning of new year.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If
the w/w overlaps the end of the old year and the beginning of the new year, the
employer may charge the week against the quota under either year; that is, it
may be charged against the old year if he has unused exempt weeks remaining
from that year, but it must be charged against the new year’s quota if he has
exhausted exempt weeks in the old year.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20j04 - OT
standard.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Since
these are exemptions from Sec 7(a), neither can be operative with respect to
any employee in a w/w when he does not work hours in excess of those specified
in Sec 7(a). If an employer can qualify for one of these exemptions he need not
pay daily OT for hours in excess of 10 in a day when no Sec 7(a) weekly OT is
worked by the employee. If an employee works two 14-hour days in a particular
w/w (28 hours total for the w/w) no OT compensation is due as he has not
exceeded the 40-hour weekly OT standard. But if an employee engaged in exempt
operations worked three 14-hour days in a selected w/w (42 hours total for the
w/w), payment of OT compensation would be due for 12 hours.</p>

<h3>20t00 - Statutory
provisions.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>(a)  
Sec 7(m) provides
a partial OT exemption: &quot;for a period or periods of not more than fourteen
workweeks in the aggregate in any calendar year, any employer may employ any
employee for a workweek in excess of that specified in subsection (a) without
paying the compensation for overtime prescribed in such subsection, if such
employee -</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
is employed by
such employer -</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)               
to provide
services (including stripping and grading) necessary and incidental to the sale
at auction of green leaf tobacco of type 11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31,
35, 36, or 37 (as such types are defined by the Secretary of Agriculture), or
in auction sale, buying, handling, stemming, redrying, packing, and storing of
such tobacco,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)               
in auction sale,
buying, handling, sorting, grading, packing, or storing green leaf tobacco of
type 32 (as such type is defined by the Secretary of Agriculture), or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)               
in auction sale,
buying, handling, stripping, sorting, grading, sizing, packing or stemming
prior to packing, of perishable cigar leaf tobacco of type 41, 42, 43, 44, 45,
46, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 61, or 62, (as such types are defined by the Secretary
of Agriculture); and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
receives for -</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)               
such employment
by such employer which is in excess of ten hours in any workday, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)               
such employment
by such employer which is in excess of forty-eight hours in any workweek,
compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at
which he is employed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer who receives an exemption under this
subsection shall not be eligible for any other exemption under this
section.&quot;</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20t01 - Application
of Sec 7(m).</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>(a)  
The weeks taken
under the Sec 7(m) exemption are applicable on an establishment basis, and an
employee may be subject to the 14-week exemption in each establishment he
works, even though such establishments are operated by a single employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Sec 7(m) is available only to the
types of employment named in the language of the exemption. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Sec 7(m) is
applicable on a w/w basis. See FOH 20j00 and 32a01 regarding computation of BW
where its terms are not met. The employer may use the Sec 7(m) exemption for
any of 14 w/w’s ending in the calendar year if the tests are met. Pursuant to
the last sentence of Sec 7(m), where an employer claims exemption for an employee
under this exemption he or she may not claim another exemption from Sec 7 for
such employee, such as under Sec 13(b)(12). </p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>20u00 - Statutory
provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
This Sec provides
a partial OT exemption (up to 10 hours in a workday and up to 48 hours in a w/w
for up to 14 w/w’s in the aggregate in any calendar year) for employees
employed &quot;exclusively to provide services necessary and incidental
to&quot;:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&quot;(A) . . . the ginning of cotton in an establishment
primarily engaged in the ginning of cotton;&quot; or </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“(B) . . . the receiving, handling, and storing of raw cotton
and the compressing of raw cotton when performed at a cotton warehouse or
compress-warehouse facility, other than one operated in conjunction with a
cotton mill, primarily engaged in storing and compressing;&quot; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&quot;(C) . . . the receiving, handling, storing, and
processing of cottonseed in an establishment primarily engaged in the
receiving, handling, storing, and processing of cottonseed; or&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&quot;(D) . . . the processing of sugar cane or sugar beets
in an establishment primarily engaged in the processing of sugar cane or sugar
beets . . . .&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   </p>
<p>(1) 
An employer’s use
of the Sec 13(h) exemption for a particular group of employees precludes use of
any other exemption under Secs 7 or 13 for those employees. Such use, however,
does not prohibit utilizing Secs 13(i) or 13(j) for certain other employees
simply because Sec 13(h) is used. Thus, for example, if an employer claims Sec
13(h) for certain employees in the establishment, he or she cannot claim other
Sec 7 or Sec 13 exemptions for them, but can utilize Secs 13(a)(1), 13(i), or
13(j) for non-Sec 13(h) activities by other employees. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The statutory
wording &quot;necessary and incidental&quot; in Sec 13(h) is not analogous in
scope to that of &quot;engaged in&quot; in Secs 13(i) and 13(j) and shall not
be interpreted to have the same meaning and effect. For example, employers
whose employees actually perform the operations described in Sec 13(i) or 13(j)
may claim the exemption for those so engaged. Employers whose employees are
engaged in occupations &quot;necessary and incidental&quot; to work performed
pursuant to Sec 13(i) or 13(j), who work exclusively in such operations and who
work solely in those portions of the premises devoted by their employer to such
operations, may claim exemption(s) provided by Sec 13(h).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Sec 13(h) is more
narrow in its application than the expired Secs 7(c) and 7(d) with respect to
the cotton storing and compressing and cottonseed processing industries.
Pursuant to Reg 526.10(b)(8) and 526.11(b)(1), old Secs 7(c) and 7(d) exempted
entire industries, whereas Secs 13(h)(1)(B) and 13(h)(1)(C) exempt only
individual employees. Sec 13(h) requires that              employees be
&quot;exclusively&quot; involved in specified activities (thus permitting no
tolerances).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Sec 13(h)
provides an exemption for employees performing auxiliary services (services
that are &quot;necessary and incidental&quot; to the named operations) which
are not exempt under Secs 13(i) and 13(j). It also replaces Secs 7(c) and/or
(d) with respect to the operations named in Sec 13(h) which were previously
exempted under Secs 7(c) and/or 7(d). For example employees not actually engaged
in ginning cotton (see IB 780.810) or processing sugar beets, sugar beet
molasses, or sugar cane into sugar (see IB 780.818) may be eligible for the
exemption provided by this Sec.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>20u01 - Cottonseed
processing.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Pursuant to Sec
13(h) the term &quot;processing of cottonseed&quot; includes cleaning and
removing hulls and linters from cottonseed, extracting oil therefrom, making
cottonseed cake and, when done in a continuous series of operations with the
crushing, grinding cake into meal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The following processing operations
are included during the period when the seed is being received: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
The grinding of
cottonseed cake, even when not part of a continuous series of operations with
the crushing, and even though an insubstantial amount of hull bran purchased
from other sources is added. Handling and grinding of the purchased bran when
only an insubstantial amount is added, are included in the exemption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The processing of
hulls into fiber and bran. The exemption is not applicable to the further
processing into fiber and bran of hulls which have been received from other
cottonseed crushing mills, except where the amount of such hulls is
insubstantial.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
The manufacture
of pellets from cottonseed meal and hulls (same exception as noted in (2) above).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
The refining of
crude cottonseed oil, which has been produced exclusively at the crushing mill,
only when done in a continuous series of operations with the crushing. The
exemption extends to laboratory employees testing crude or refined oil during
the crushing season.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Processing
cottonseed includes preparation of cottonseed for planting by means of drying,
screening, delinting, redrying, or poisoning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  As a practical matter, CO’s are not
expected to check for trivial amounts of time spent by an otherwise exempt
employee in nonexempt work such as selling bagging and ties as an
accommodation. </p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>20u02 - Cotton
storing and compressing within the meaning of Sec 13(h).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Includes
the receiving, handling, and storing of raw cotton and the compressing of raw
cotton when performed at a cotton warehouse or compress-warehouse facility
other than one operated in conjunction with a cotton mill. Also included are
any operations incident to the foregoing such as loading, unloading, weighing,
sampling, assembling, and preparing for shipment, when performed at the storing
establishment.</p>

<h3>20v00 - Statutory
provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Sec 13(i)
provides a partial OT exemption &quot;for a period or periods of not more than
fourteen workweeks in the aggregate in any period of fifty-two consecutive
weeks to any employee who – </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
is engaged in the
ginning of cotton for market in any place of employment located in a county
where cotton is grown in commercial quantities, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
receives for any
such employment during such workweeks – </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A.                
in excess of ten
hours in any workday, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>B.                
in excess of
forty-eight hours in any workweek, and compensation at a rate not less than one
and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed. No week included
in any fifty-two week period for purposes of the preceding sentence may be
included for such purposes in any other fifty-two week period&quot;.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Unlike Sec 7(c) (repealed effective
12/31/76) that applied on a calendar-year basis, Sec 13(i), like former Sec
13(b)(25), is applicable during the active season within a period of 52
consecutive weeks. This means an employer may start his or her exemption year
in any w/w during the active season and can select the Sec 13(i) exemption
weeks available from the rest of the subsequent 51 w/w’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Prior to the 1977
amendments (effective 1/1/78), Sec 13(i) replaced Sec 13(b)(25) and the latter
provided a partial OT exemption as illustrated in the following table: </p>

<p>Includes
the following operations, when performed during the period or periods when
cotton is being received for ginning: the receiving of seed cotton at the gin,
the handling, cleaning, ginning, and baling of the cotton, the handling of the
baled cotton and cottonseed, and any operations or services necessary or
incident to the foregoing, including the placing of the cotton and cottonseed
in storage or transportation facilities on or near the premises.</p>

<h3>21a00 - General provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 13(a)(2) provides an exemption from Secs 6 and 7
for any employee employed by any retail or service establishment (except an
establishment or employee engaged in laundering, cleaning, or repairing
clothing or fabrics or an establishment engaged in the operation of a hospital,
institution, or school described in Sec 3(s)(5)), if more than 50% of such
establishment’s ADV of sales of goods or services is made within the State in
which the establishment is located, and such establishment is not in an
enterprise described in Sec 3(s).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Additionally, Sec
13(g) provides that the MW exemption component of Sec 13(a)(2) shall not apply
with respect to any covered employee employed by an establishment which is part
of a “conglomerate” (see FOH 25o).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The exemption does not apply to establishments of
enterprises including public enterprises, and any retail or service
establishment controlled by a conglomerate pursuant to Sec 13(g) even though
the establishment is not an enterprise (as defined in Sec 3(r)): e.g., company
store owned by a coal company.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   A “retail or service establishment” shall mean an
establishment 75% of whose ADV of sales of goods or services (or of both) is
not for resale and is recognized as retail sales or services in the particular
industry.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21a01 - Application of Sec 13(a)(2).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 13(a)(2) applies to all employees employed by any
retail or service establishment which meets the tests for the exemption except:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  An establishment or employee engaged in laundering,
cleaning or repairing clothing or fabrics (however, see FOH 12e03); or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  An establishment engaged in the operation of a
hospital, institution, or school described in Sec 3(s)(5); or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  An establishment to which Sec 13(a)(2) is inapplicable
because of Sec 13(g).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The application of Sec 13(a)(2) was changed by the
1977 Amendments through changes to Sec 3(s). See Sec 3(s), FOH 12b00(d)(1), and
FOH 12d00. The following illustrates this relationship:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  All enterprises covered under Sec 3(s)(1), 3(s)(2),
3(s)(3), 3(s)(4), 3(s)(5), or 3(s)(6), whichever is applicable.  Retail or
service establishments of such enterprises cannot qualify for Sec 13(a)(2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  An enterprise comprised exclusively of retail or
service establishments which met the ADV test on 6/30/78 but later did not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An establishment of such an enterprise must continue to pay its
employees the MW in effect on the day before the increase in the statutory ADV
level took effect. (See FOH 12d.) If the ADV later falls below $250,000, Sec
13(a)(2) is applicable. Sec 13(a)(2) will remain applicable to such an
establishment until the ADV for the enterprise rises to the current ADV under
Sec 3(s)(2) ($362,500).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  An enterprise comprised exclusively of retail or
service establishments which was not covered under Sec 3(s)(2) on 6/30/78.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An establishment of such an enterprise would be exempt under Sec
13(a)(2) unless and until the enterprise meets the expanded AGV tests of Sec
3(s)(2):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$275,000 effective 7/1/78</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$325,000 effective 7/1/80</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$362,500 effective 1/1/82</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Hospitals, nursing homes, and certain schools do not
qualify for Sec (13(a)(2) (see FOH 12f).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  A veterinary hospital is not a “hospital” within the
meaning of this exclusion from Sec 13(a)(2). Therefore, a veterinary hospital
may qualify for Sec 13(a)(2) if the tests are met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Schools described in Sec 3(s)(5) are excluded from
exemption under Sec 13(a)(2). However, in some cases, particularly in colleges
or universities, the school enterprise may operate (or lease for operation) on
the campus a separate and distinct physical place of business (see IB 779.302
-779.305), which invites the patronage of the public (including students and
faculty) and which standing alone meets all the tests for exemption as a retail
or service establishment. In such cases, such a separate establishment shall be
tested for exemption in the same manner as any other retail or service
establishment. For example, if a college operates a bookstore which sells at
the retail level and the store is a separate place of business open to the
general public as well as the students and faculty of the university, having
its own employees, management, accounts, and records, and meets other tests
specified in the exemption, the employees in the bookstore may be exempt from
the Act’s pay requirements.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21a02 - Employees “employed by” a new retail or service establishment
before it opens for business.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Situations may be
encountered where employees are hired prior to the opening of a new retail or
service establishment to prepare the premises for occupancy, to receive and
arrange the stock, and to perform other activities which are a necessary
incident to opening the establishment for business. To the extent that these
are employees of the establishment itself, and not “central office or
warehouse” employees assigned to do this preparatory work for a chain, they are
“employed by” an establishment which, when open, will be a retail or service
establishment. In such cases these employees will be treated as “employed by” a
retail or service establishment in applying Sec 13(a)(2). (See IB 779.269,
“Computations for a new business”.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21a03 - Use of FOH Chapter 21 and IB 779.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>IB 779 contains the
basic interpretations by the Adm of the scope and terms of the retail and
service establishment and related exemptions. FOH Chapter 21 supplements these interpretations.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21a04 - Exemption effect on FLSA CL and R/K requirements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The retail or service
establishment exemptions provide exemption only from Secs 6 and 7. They do not
provide exemption from the CL and R/K provisions of the Act. (See IB 779.500 through
779.515.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21a06 - Employees employed in the work of more than one establishment of
the same employer.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>IB 779.309 through
779.311 sets forth the principles to be followed in determining whether an
employee who is employed in the work of more than one establishment of his
employer in the same w/w is “employed by” a retail or service establishment for
purposes of exemption. The principles may be further illustrated in the case of
a tailor, who may make alterations upon clothing in one retail establishment
which was sold in another of his employer’s retail establishments. In such
cases the tailor at any given time during the week is actually performing
alterations which are incidental to the specific retail sales of a particular
retail establishment and is engaged in the work of such exempt establishment
itself and thus is “employed by” the establishment while so engaged. An
employee would not, therefore, be disqualified for exemption in any w/w when he
is “employed by” an exempt retail establishment at all time during the w/w even
though not “employed by” the same exempt establishment for the entire week.
(See also IB 779.369(g) for the application of this principle to morticians.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21a07 - Incidental processing and servicing distinguished from manufacturing.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Processing incidental to retail selling of goods or
services is not a manufacturing activity. For example, a grocery store may
grind coffee; a drug store may prepare prescriptions; a restaurant may process
food; a clothing store may make alterations on suits; or a repair garage may
grind valves. The applicability of a retail or service exemption to the
establishment or to the individual employees is not affected by the performance
of such processing activities which are incidental to retail selling or
servicing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Work performed on the customer’s own goods where the
completed job will not result in the creation of a different product from that
which the customer brought in will be considered as “services” for purposes of
the retail or service exemptions, and, if recognized in the particular industry
as retail services, will be considered as such for purposes of determining the
applicability of the exemption. For example, the recapping of a tire for a
customer, the upholstering of a chair for a customer, the repairing of an
automobile for a customer regardless of the degree of repairs, the rebuilding
of a pair of shoes for a customer, or the rebuilding of a typewriter for a
customer, are regarded as the performance of services for purposes of the
application of the retail or service establishment exemptions. Where, however,
the job would result in the creation of a different product from that which the
customer brought in such as, for example, where a truck or a bus is made out of
the customer’s automobile, or where a suit of clothes is made out of a piece of
cloth the customer brought in, the activity of making the truck, the bus, or
the suit of clothes is a manufacturing activity and employees engaged in such
activities, to be exempt, must qualify under Sec 13(a)(4).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   If the activity is not performed on the customer’s own
goods as in (b) above but is performed for commercial purposes, as for example,
where old tires are purchased by an establishment and recapped for purposes of
sale, or old typewriters are purchased and rebuilt for purposes of sale, or old
furniture is purchased and reupholstered for purposes of sale, the
manufacturing involved in these operations would not constitute a “service” for
purposes of the retail and service exemptions. To be exempt, employees engaged
in these activities must qualify for exemption under Sec 13(a)(4).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21a08 - Establishments engaged in making sales through outside salesmen.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A retail or service
establishment within the meaning of the Act is one which is open and available
to the general public, with which it has direct dealings, either in person or
by telephone or by mail. (See IB 779.319.) An establishment which merely
distributes goods to outside salesmen (or door-to-door canvassers), or merely
delivers goods sold by such outside salesmen, does not qualify as a retail or
service establishment even though, on occasion, it may make some retail sales
on the premises.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21a09 - Establishments located on instrumentalities or facilities of
commerce.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The fact that an establishment
is located on an instrumentality or facility of commerce, including government
installations, does not of itself preclude the possible applicability of a
retail or service establishment exemption. It is possible under certain
circumstances, for example, that employees of a post exchange or barbershop
located on a military installation may be subject to a retail or service
establishment exemption if all the tests for exemption are met.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21a10 - Vending machine “establishments”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Some independently owned and operated vending machine
companies install, control, service, and supply with merchandise their vending
machines located in plants, buildings, transportation terminals, and the like.
Such vending machine installations operate and function independently of the
plant or building in which they are located, under a lessor-lessee arrangement.
Typically, the machines are installed in groups or banks, in some cases
together with tables and/or benches. There may be several groups of these
machines in one building. Employees called “matrons” or “hostesses” are
assigned to keep the machines filled, offer assistance to customers, make
change, maintain the area and generally see to the operation of the machines;
“inside routemen” may be assigned to stock these machines. In such cases where
the machines are independently owned and operated by the vending machine firm
and are attended by its employees, it is the position of Wage and Hour that
each group or bank of machines may constitute a separate and distinct
establishment; in some cases those vending locations (perhaps one or more
groups) which are located in the same building can be considered a single
establishment if operated as such. Since sales through vending machines are
considered retail, the employees employed at these locations may qualify for
exemption under Sec 13(a)(2) if the tests are met. Sec 13(b)(8) may also apply
since the food stations will qualify as restaurants. Similarly, an employee who
services two or more groups of machines may qualify for exemption per FOH 21a06
as he or she is considered engaged in retail activities and not central office
functions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  In many cases the groups or banks of machines as
described in (a) above are controlled by a central office and/or commissary
kitchen or warehouse located off the premises which purchases merchandise,
prepares food and performs accounting, clerical, and related duties. These
central offices, etc., do not qualify as retail establishments and employees
employed by the firm at such locations are not exempt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   In some cases, usually in larger plants, the vending
machine company may operate an office located on the premises to supervise all
operations of the firm in the particular plant. Such an office may include a
storage area for merchandise for the machines. The storage area and office
serve only the food banks located at the particular plant. The employees
employed by the firm work exclusively at this location and the office keeps its
own records and orders it own supplies. Hostesses and routemen are employed by
this office to service the machines located at various points in the plant. In
such a case the firm is operating a business possessing unity of ownership,
unity of operations, unity of function, and though consisting of separate
“stations” or “food banks” the business at the location is consolidated and
operated as a functionally integrated unit. Where a business with such
characteristics is located in one plant, factory, or building and serves no
outside establishments, the parts of such a business, including the office,
storage area, and food banks will be considered one single establishment for
purposes of exemption. As such, Secs 13(a)(2) and 13(b)(8) may apply if the
tests are met.</p>

<h3>21b00 - Establishment--single concession.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A concession such as
one in a ball park which supplies its stands and hawkers with hot dogs,
popcorn, and the like from one central commissary is a single establishment for
the purposes of the retail and service establishment exemptions. The business
possesses unity of ownership, unity of operations, unity of functions, and
though broken into units known as stands, is consolidated and operated as an integrated
unit. The stands and the vendors do not have independent characters of their
own as establishments, for they are on a temporary relationship to the
commissary and fulfill the functions of departments for an establishment. Only
together with the commissary can they constitute a definable establishment.
Thus, unlike a commissary serving a chain of retail stands operated in a
transportation terminal or similar area, the concession commissary does not in
essence perform a warehouse function for a group of establishments within the
meaning of the FLSA, but is rather fundamentally a necessary complement to an
integrated retail establishment. This business operates on the same premises of
the ball park stadium, and no other establishments separate the parts of the
business.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21b01 - Establishment-multiple concessions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The fact that the
firm’s concessions are “under one roof”, as in the case of a firm which leases
space at an airport terminal building, a railway station, or similar restricted
area, does not of itself create a “single establishment”. (Nor is this
situation comparable to that involving the operation of leased departments
within the meaning of IB 779.225 or 779.306.) A determination as to whether the
operations constitute one or more than one establishment must be made. Among
the factors to be taken into consideration are the relative physical location
of the units, the degree of segregation along functional lines, whether or not
there is a common supervisory staff, the amount of employee interchange, and
the extent to which separate sales or other records are kept. If it is found
the operations constitute more than one establishment, each individual
establishment must meet the tests for exemption. With respect to employees who
perform work for more than one of the establishments see FOH 21a06.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21b02 - Casinos in hotels.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   In some cases a hotel and a gambling casino are
operated in conjunction with each other, often in the same building. In view of
the normal physical and functional separation of casino operations in a hotel
setting, as influenced by the differences in legal requirements for hotels as
such and for casino operations, the casino will be considered a separate
establishment under the principles expressed in IB 779.305. (See also FOH 21cg00.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  In such combined establishments there are various
employees such as bookkeepers, custodial workers, maintenance workers, porters,
and others whose work relates in part to the casino as well as to the hotel.
For enforcement purposes, such an auxiliary employee will be considered to be
within any exemption for which the hotel qualifies (such as Secs 13(a)(2) or
13(b)(8) in any w/w in which 20% or less of his time is allocable to the work
of the nonexempt casino).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21b03 - “Open to the public”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Where membership in an establishment may be purchased,
without restriction, by the general consuming public, the business may qualify
as a “retail or service establishment” for purposes of Sec 13(a)(2) and also
may qualify for Sec 13(a)(3).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Whether such an establishment is open to the public or
is a “private club” is a factual determination. Some of the factors which are
of primary importance in the determination of whether membership is selective
are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Whether the existing members have any control over the
administration of applicants for membership, e.g., whether there is a
membership committee selected by the members to represent them, whether there
is a blackball system by which individual members can reject an applicant even
though he might have been recommended by another member;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Whether the existing members have any control over
revocation of membership of other members;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Whether the recommendations of members are required on
applications;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Whether the number is limited in any way other than by
the capacity of the facilities;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Whether there are any genuine qualifications for
membership, e.g., residence in a particular location, position in a particular
social or economic class, good reputation or character; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Whether the members exercise control over the
operations of the establishment. While there are other facts which determine
whether an establishment serves the public or is a “private club”, the above
are the core factors. (See also IB 779.319.)</p>

<h3>21c00 - Purpose and use.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The interpretations
contained in FOH 21c illustrate the application of the principles set out in IB
779 to specific situations involving the retail concept, sales for resale, and
the making of sales of goods or services recognized as retail. The examples
selected have been chosen primarily to serve as guides in those situations
where the principle involved is of widespread application or where field experience
has indicated a specific need.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ca00 - Advertising distribution.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>The distribution of
advertising is a service which is the same in nature whether it is performed
for a retail store, a mail-order house, or a manufacturer, or to advertise a
parade or political rally, or to urge a segment of the public to organize
itself. Such services are totally unrelated to the concept of a retail service,
as it is commonly and traditionally understood, and are not recognized as
retail services.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21c01 - Airport limousine service.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees performing
activities in connection with the operation of an airport limousine or other
transportation terminal limousine service are not within the Sec 13(a)(2)
exemption. Such activities are wholly lacking in any retail concept and are
not, therefore, within the scope of their employer’s otherwise exempt retail
business. (See IB 779.308.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ca02 - Airports - aviation sales and services.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>There is no concept of
retailing in the operation of an airport as such nor is the sale of aviation
supplies, parts, or services recognized as retail in the industry. (See also IB
779.317.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ca03 - Auto, truck, and trailer rental.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An establishment engaged exclusively or nearly so in
the business of renting and leasing trucks or trailers to commercial and
industrial firms is not normally considered to be within the retail concept
since its services are performed in the midst of commercial transactions rather
than at the retail distribution level.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The rental of trucks or trailers by establishments
other than those described in (a) above may be recognized as retail. In such
cases, if the sale of a type of truck or trailer is recognized as retail, then
the rental of such truck or trailer may also be recognized as retail. (See IB
779.371.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The rental of passenger cars ordinarily is retail. In
making a determination as to the status of rentals the tests set out in IB
779.371 for the sales of such vehicles should be used.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Vehicles used by rental firms in leasing and renting
operations are ordinarily sold after the vehicles have outlived their
usefulness for leasing or rental purposes. Such sales are included in the
establishment’s ADV of sales. Where the vehicles are sold to used car dealers
for resale, as is frequently the case, such sales are not recognized as retail.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ca04 - Auto repairs.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Repairs of cars for other garages which in turn charge
their customers for the repairs are sales for resale.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Repairs of cars for used car dealers, prior to their
sale by such dealers, are sales for resale.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Repairs of cars used by employees at the expense of
their employers, to whom the bills are sent directly, are retail sales.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Repairs on privately owned cars even though paid for
directly by insurance companies are retail sales.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ca05 - Ambulance services.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>See IB 779.369. This
Section provides that an employee of a mortuary will continue to be within an
otherwise applicable Sec 13(a)(2) exemption if he devotes an insubstantial
amount of his time in the w/w (not more than 20%) in performing nonexempt
ambulance transportation activities. These same principles are equally
applicable where nonexempt ambulance transportation activities are performed by
employees of other types of retail establishments, such as a garage or a
general merchandise store.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ca06 - Apartment houses.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>The leasing or renting
of space to tenants of apartment houses lacks the retail concept necessary to
qualify an establishment as a retail or service establishment under Sec
13(a)(2). (See IB 779.317.) The sale of leasehold interests in real property is
not included in the “sales of goods or services” in which a retail or service
establishment (as defined in Sec 13(a)(2)) must engage. Receipts from such
leasing or rental activities are included in the ADV of the enterprise for purpose
of amended Sec 3(s)(1).</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ca07 - Auto license plate sales by retail establishments.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>Some privately owned
retail establishments operate “auto tag agencies” or “auto license bureaus” and
sell auto license plates. The sales of auto license plates are sales to which
the retail concept does not apply, and the gross price of the plates is
included in the ADV for purpose of Sec 13(a)(2).</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21cb00 - Baby chicks.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>The sale of baby
chicks for raising and reselling is a sale for resale, and furthermore is not recognized
as a retail sale in the industry. Such sales are between the producer and the
grower and are far removed from the retail level of distribution.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21cb01 - Boatyards.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The two types of establishments found in this industry
are boatyards, where boats are built or large boats are repaired, and the
marina, which includes yacht basins, yacht clubs, and repair establishments
where small boats are serviced or repaired. Both the boatyards and the marina
usually sell boats, boat supplies, and accessories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Boatyards are not recognized as retail establishments
in the industry and are not the type of establishment contemplated by the
exemption. A sales analysis should never be necessary of such an establishment.
A marina, however, is the type of establishment which is recognized as retail
in the industry. It may qualify for the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption and its sales
may be analyzed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   To distinguish between a boatyard and a marina note
the permanent physical facilities for repairing boats. Boatyards have facilities,
such as a railway, for taking large boats out of the water for repairs. Marinas
do not have such facilities. Occasionally, a marina may utilize manpower or a
portable crane to take a boat out of the water but this does not transform the
marina into a boatyard, since large boats normally cannot be taken out of the
water in this manner. The servicing of large boats by a marina is a retail
service because it is of the same general type the marina provides for small
boats.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Operations of individual establishments in this
industry may change. For example, a marina may, after a time, broaden out and
acquire equipment until it has the characteristics of a boatyard even though it
may still retain the title of marina. Or, a boatyard may find, because of a
change in the nature of its customers, that it now only services small boats
and that its railway is no longer in use. Thus, the facilities of an
establishment are important but not necessarily conclusive as to its status.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21cb02 - Beauty preparations and cosmetics.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>Sales to beauty shops
of beauty preparations, such as creams, lotions, and rinses, which are used
upon the persons of the beauty shops’ customers as a part of the service
rendered, are sales for resale regardless of whether the customer is charged
separately for these items.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>2lcc00 - Contract mail hauling.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees performing
activities in connection with the hauling of mail under contract with the Post
Office Department are not within the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption. Such activities
are wholly lacking in any retail concept and are not, therefore, within the
scope of their employer’s otherwise exempt retail business. (See IB 779.308.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21cc01 - Contract post offices.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The remuneration which a contract post office receives
from the government should not be included in the sales analysis. The receipts
from “sales of goods or services” are the monies collected from the public for
the sales of stamps, money orders, and the like. Such sales are not recognized
as retail. With reference to money orders only, the fees are counted and not
the money transmitted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  An employee engaged in performing post office work in
an exempt retail or service establishment is “employed by” such an
establishment within the meaning of IB 779.308 unless he is employed by the
Post Office Department. If the establishment, including the contract post
office, meets the tests of the retail exemption, all employees employed by it
will be exempt. However, the employer may claim that the postal substation and
the retail establishment constitute separate establishments, and such a claim
will be allowed if the conditions for segregation contained in IB 779.305 are
met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   An auxiliary employee of an exempt retail or service
establishment performing general office, custodial, maintenance, or messenger
work for a nonexempt contract postal station will, for enforcement purposes, be
considered exempt in any w/w if no more than 20% of his time is spent in such
work.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21cc02 - Concrete blocks and flues.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>Sales of concrete
blocks and flues may be recognized as retail sales. Such items are considered
to be building materials and sales shall be classified as retail or nonretail
in accordance with the principles set out in IB 779.335, 779.336, 779.355, and
FOH 21cL00.</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>21cd01 - Driving schools.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>The retail concept
does not apply to establishments engaged in the activity of selling and giving
driving instructions and preparing members of the public for examination given
by the State for driver’s license.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ce00 - Exterminating service.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Exterminator service establishments may be recognized
as retail. However, where the facilities and equipment of an establishment are
designed for the service of factory or commercial buildings and are of a type
which the general consuming public does not ordinarily have occasion to use,
the services are specialized and are not traditionally recognized as retail
within the meaning of the exemption even though the firm may also,
occasionally, render services to the general consuming public. On the other
hand, if the exterminating facilities and equipment used in servicing
commercial buildings are no different from those used in servicing private
residences, such services may be regarded as retail.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Exterminating services performed regularly and
repeatedly for a commercial or industrial firm under contract, covering an
extended period of time, constitute maintenance operations and are not,
therefore, recognized as retail services.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21cf00 - Farm implement sales.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sales of new or used farm implements and farm
machinery, including such items as gardening and lawn care equipment, are
recognized as retail regardless of whether they are purchased by farmers or
non-farmers. Servicing and repair of such items, and sales of parts for them,
are also recognized as retail. (See IB 779.371(e).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Sales of equipment such as the specialized types of
construction and processing machinery set out in IB 779.371(e)(3) which are not
normally used in farming operations are not recognized as retail sales.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Certain types of equipment, such as land levelers, may
be used both in construction and in farming operations. Where exemption depends
on the retail or nonretail nature of sales of such multi-purpose equipment, the
facts shall be obtained and submitted through channels to the RS for an
opinion.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21cf01 - Florists’ Telegraph Delivery sales.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sales of flowers to consumers through Florists’
Telegraph Delivery (FTD) are considered retail sales. Under the FTD
Arrangement, in order to serve retail customers who wish flowers delivered at
distant locations, other member florists have agreed that the flowers sold by
the establishment to which the customer comes will be supplied and delivered by
an establishment in whose delivery area the recipient is located. Each member
establishment will both sell flowers for delivery from the stock of other
members and deliver from its own stock flowers sold by them, with settlement
made periodically through clearing house procedures. The ADV allocable to
either of these activities, as computed under (b) below, is counted as receipts
from retail sales and/or services for purposes of the 75% test in Sec 13(a)(2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The ADV for purposes of enterprise coverage and the
application of Sec 13(a)(2) shall be determined as follows: Florist A takes an
order from a customer and receives full payment ($20) for the flowers plus
$2.00 for the telegram and service charge, a total of $22.00. The order is
telegraphed to florist B who delivers the flowers to the recipient. As a result
of this transaction, florist A retains 20% of the sales price, plus the charges
($6.00 in all) and florist B receives 80% of the sales price ($16). In such a
case, florist A must include the total amount received by him ($22) from the
customer in his ADV; florist B must include in his ADV the total amount he or
she receives in the transaction ($16). If florist A is in Colorado and florist
B in Illinois, the interstate sales for purposes of the 50% test as set out in
(c) below would be ($22) for florist A and ($16) for florist B. In the above
example, florist A’s ADV would also include any additional amounts charged the
customer for taxes, except that any excise taxes at the retail level which are
separately stated are not to be computed as part of the ADV for purposes of the
monetary test of Sec 3(s)(2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   In any case where a florist’s establishment meets the
statutory definition of a “retail or service establishment” and is not part of
a covered enterprise, it is still necessary to determine for purposes of the
Sec 13(a)(2) exemption whether more than 50% of the establishment’s ADV of
sales is made within the State. For example, florist A in Colorado receives an
order for flowers to be delivered in Illinois; he wires the order (FTD) for
florist B in Illinois to deliver the flowers. The sale is an interstate sale
for purposes of Sec 13(a)(2), both with respect to the florist in Colorado and
the florist in Illinois. Also included as interstate sales for this purpose are
sales by a florist for direct delivery by him into another State. (In
determining the ADV for purpose of this test, see also (b) above.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21cg00 - Gambling receipts.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>The receipts from
gambling activities are not recognized as receipts from retail sales or
services. Thus, for example, employees engaged in the operation of a gambling
casino are not within the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21cg01 - Golf shops in country clubs.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>In the ordinary case a
golf shop in a country club is not open to the public and cannot qualify for
the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption (see IB 779.317). However, if such a golf shop is
open and available to the general public as well as to club members and is a
“distinct physical place of business” separate from other facilities and
qualifies as an “establishment” the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption may apply if the
tests are met.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21cg02 - Gasoline sales to truckers.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>Sales of gasoline at
the ordinary gasoline service establishment (not a truck stop) by the “tankful”
to truckers for use in the operation of the vehicle are generally recognized as
retail sales notwithstanding that discounts such as 2 cents per gallon are
allowed or that the sales are made on a credit card basis. (See also IB
779.371(c)(6).)</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21cg03 - Civic and convention centers.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Civic and convention centers whether publicly or
privately owned or operated are normally engaged primarily in the business of
renting space to business and civic organizations attracted to the locality. [n
order to attract conventions such centers “sell” their capability to “house”
business meetings, trade shows, auto and boat shows, open-air exhibitions and
mass meetings, including the directly related ancillary capabilities, i.e.,
parking lot, recreation, eating facilities, etc. Such rental of space to
business and civic organizations constitutes a business activity lacking the
retail concept. (See also FOH 21ca06.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The fact that independent contractors are engaged to
cater food and beverages to the various groups and participants in activities
held at the Centers does not alter the nonretail character of the Centers.
Also, the fact that certain exemptions (e.g., Sec 13(a)(2), 13(b)(8), or 14)
may be applicable to employees of such independent contractors, depending upon
circumstances and character of the contractor’s business, does not affect the
applicability of the Act to employees of the Center.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ch00 - Hotels, motels, and restaurants - competitive bid sales.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>In determining the
application of the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption to hotels, motels, and restaurants,
sales resulting from competitive bids are not considered characteristic of
retail selling and are not generally recognized as retail. For example, certain
contracts for furnishing meals and/or lodging to government employees or
military personnel may be let on the basis of competitive bid procedures. (See
IB 779.328(d).)</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ci00 - Industrial maintenance services.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>An organization which
cleans air ducts, elevator shafts, air conditioning equipment, ventilating
systems, flues, stacks, and the like, and repairs and refills fire
extinguishers, fireproofs drapes, decorations, show booths, and the like, and
performs maintenance work almost entirely for commercial or industrial
establishments is performing specialized services which the general consuming
public does not ordinarily have occasion to use. The organization is not
engaged in activities which are traditionally recognized as retail even though
it may also sometimes sell goods or render services to the general consuming
public.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21cL00 - Lumber and building materials sales to contractors or builders.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The lumber and building materials determination (see
IB 779.355) together with Sec 3(n) form the basis for determining which sales
are not for resale and are recognized as retail in the industry. In applying
the tests of the lumber and building materials determination and Sec 3(n) to
sales of materials to contractors or builders it is necessary to take into
consideration, also, the general principles contained in IB 779.327 - 779.329,
779.335, and 779.336 which relate to retail and wholesale sales in general and
sales for resale.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The sale of lumber and building materials to
contractors or builders for residential, farm or commercial construction,
repair or maintenance are sales for resale unless excluded from this category
by Sec 3(n). In order for such sales for to be excluded for the category of
“for resale” all the tests of Sec 3(n) must be met (see IB 779.335 and
779.336). The tests are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The goods sold must be used in residential or farm
building construction, repair, or maintenance, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The sale must be recognized as a bona fide retail sale
in the industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With respect to the
first test contained in Sec 3(n) it is clear that sales of materials to
contractors for use in the construction, repair, or maintenance of apartment
houses, motels, churches, schools or other commercial or industrial structures
are sales for resale. Such structures are not “residential” buildings of the
type contemplated by Sec 3(n).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   With respect to the second test of Sec 3(n), in
determining whether sales of lumber and building materials are recognized as
bona fide retail sales in the industry, it is necessary first to test such
sales under the lumber and building materials determination. If they are not
recognized as retail under the principles set forth in the determination, they
will not meet the second test of Sec 3(n). It does not follow, however, that
all sales recognized in the determination as retail are recognized as bona fide
retail sales for purposes of Sec 3(n). Thus, although the determination, among
other things, recognizes sales in other than direct carload lots as retail sales
(see IB 779.355(b)(3)), regard must be given to the legislative history and
Wage-Hour’s position that sales of lumber to a contractor to build a whole
residential subdivision are not recognized as bona fide retail sales under Sec
3(n) (see IB 779.335). There may, therefore, be certain circumstances under
which sales in other than direct carload lots are not recognized as bona fide
retail sales within the meaning of Sec 3(n). For example, some contractors
engaged in the building of subdivisions may build only a few houses at a given
time, and possibly purchase materials in lot quantities sufficient to construct
only one house at a given time. Where such lumber sales are made pursuant to a
contract, agreement or understanding that the dealer is to supply the
contractor with all his lumber requirements for a subdivision consisting of a
fixed or indefinite number of houses such sales would not be recognized as
retail regardless of whether the lumber is to be delivered in small quantities
as construction progresses or all at one time (see IB 779.328(c)).
Consequently, such sales would not qualify for exclusion from the category of
sales for resale under Sec 3(n).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Situations may be encountered where a contractor is
engaged in building a number of houses on scattered lots and is purchasing the
materials for his own use in total amounts as great as a contractor who is
building a whole subdivision. Where, as in (c) above, the total amount of
materials contemplated for delivery pursuant to a direct or indirect contract,
agreement or understanding between the dealer and the contractor is materially
in excess of the total quantity of goods which might reasonably be purchased by
a member of the general consuming public during the same period, under Sec 3(n)
such sales would not be recognized as bona fide retail sales. Of course, in
those instances where a contractor is purchasing materials to build a single
house only, whether or not in behalf of the home owner, such a sale may be
recognized as being a bona fide retail sale within the meaning of Sec 3(n).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Where the retail or nonretail nature of sales to
contractors or builders cannot be determined on the basis of the above
principles and such questions are determinative of the compliance status of the
establishment, the facts shall be obtained and the matter referred through
channels to the RS for an opinion.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21d00 - General provisions and IB 779.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 13(a)(4) provides an exemption from Secs 6 and 7
of the Act for any employee employed by an establishment which qualifies as an
exempt retail establishment under Sec 13(a)(2) of the Act and is recognized as
a retail establishment in the particular industry notwithstanding that such
establishment makes or processes at the retail establishment the goods that it
sells: Provided, That more than 85 percentum of such establishment’s annual
dollar volume of sales of goods so made or processed is made within the State
in which the establishment is located.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  IB 779.345 through 779.350 set forth Wage-Hour’s
position regarding the applicability of Sec 13(a)(4).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21d01 - Where FLSA Sec 13(a)(4) exemption is inapplicable.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Where an establishment meets the requirements of the
Sec 13(a)(2) exemption, but fails to meet the additional requirements provided
under Sec 13(a)(4), all employees employed by the establishment, other than
employees engaged in the making or processing activities, will be exempt under
Sec 13(a)(2). In such a case it is, therefore, necessary to determine which
employees are engaged in the making and processing activities and thus are not
eligible for the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Where clerical, messenger, or custodial employees work
for both the selling as well as the manufacturing part of the establishment,
the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption will apply to such employees, for enforcement
purposes if in any w/w no more than 20% of their time is allocable to the
manufacturing portion of the establishment. (See IB 779.368.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21d02 - Homeworkers employed by exempt establishment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Sec 13(a)(4)
exemption does not extend to homeworkers.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21d03 - R/K under Sec 13(a)(4).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   To furnish proof of an exemption under Sec 13(a)(4), a
retail establishment may find it necessary to keep detailed records showing not
only where its sales were made, but which sales were of goods made or processed
by it. Without this more detailed record, the establishment may be able to
prove that at least 50% of its ADV of sales was made within the State but not
be able to prove that at least 85% of the goods made or processed by it were
sold within the State.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  While generally a claim by an establishment to
exemption under Sec 13(a)(4) must be supported by records, care shall be
exercised not to impose an unnecessary R/K burden on the establishment.
However, if the establishment makes or processes goods which it does not sell
within the State and a proper determination of exemption under Sec 13(a)(4)
will be difficult in the future without this additional sales information, the
establishment shall be advised of the wisdom of showing such additional data in
its records.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21d04 - Example of application of Sec 13(a)(4) requirements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   As an example of how the percentage requirements for
exemption under Sec 13(a)(4) might be applied, the following illustration is
offered. The ABC Bakery Shop, located at Portchester, New York, near the New
York-Connecticut boundary, does all of the baking of breads and pastries and
the selling of these bread and pastries at the same establishment, and in
addition purchases milk and cream for resale to its customers. It sells and
delivers not only to private individuals for home consumption, but also to
certain restaurants and roadside diners located in New York and nearby
Connecticut.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  An analysis of its ADV of sales discloses:</p>

</div>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The establishment meets the qualification that 50% or
more of its ADV of sales must be made within the State in which it is located -
$76,000 out of a total of $100,000.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  The establishment meets the qualification that 75% or
more of its sales are recognized as retail in the industry and not for resale -
$86,000 out of $100,000.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   The establishment does not meet the qualification that
85% of its ADV of sales of the goods made by it, namely the breads and
pastries, must be sold within the State—only $70,000 out of $90,000 is sold
within the State.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Because it does not meet the requirement that 85% of
its ADV of sales of the goods made by it must be sold within the State, the ABC
Bakery Shop cannot be exempted under Sec 13(a)(4), and the employees making the
breads and pastries are not exempt. However, since the establishment meets the
requirements for exemption under Sec 13(a)(2), all other employees employed by
it are exempt, except those who engaged in producing breads and pastries</p>

<h3>21e00 - Purpose and use.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>FOH 21e contains
examples relating to retail recognition in the industry of establishments
engaged in making or processing the goods sold. These examples are to be used
in conjunction with IB 779 for the purpose of distinguishing establishments
recognized as retail from factories for which there is no retail recognition in
the particular industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ea00 - Auto engines or transmissions rebuilt.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>An establishment which
removes engines or transmissions from cars and replaces them with engines or
transmissions rebuilt on the premises is engaged in manufacturing and is not
recognized as a retail establishment in the industry under Sec 13(a)(4).</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ea01 - Auto wrecking.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>An establishment
engaged in wrecking automobiles would not be exempt under Sec 13(a)(4) since a
wrecking yard is not recognized as a retail establishment. It does not matter
that the wrecking activities consist of dismantling automobiles to salvage
parts sold at retail. The sale of new or used automobile parts to individuals
for their own use is recognized as retail sales, whether the sales are made by
a service garage or a wrecking company. An auto wrecking establishment,
although it is not recognized as a retail establishment for Sec 13(a)(4)
purposes, may be entitled to the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption if it meets the
statutory tests for the latter exemption. If it is exempt under Sec 13(a)(2)
only, those employees not engaged in the wrecking or dismantling activities
will be exempt. Sales of junk are not recognized as retail.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21eb00 - Bakeries.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>A bakery which sells
through special outlets or which makes virtually all of its sales at the homes
of its customers through driver-salesmen is not recognized as a retail
establishment in the particular industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ec00 - Canvas covers.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>The Sec 13(a)(4)
exemption does not apply to a manufacturing establishment which makes and sells
canvas products such as truck covers, hay stack covers, luggage covers, combine
canvases, cream can lid covers, miscellaneous canvas bags, or other canvas
products manufactured to specifications of the purchaser.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>2lec01 - Concrete blocks. flues, and pipe manufacture.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An establishment engaged in manufacturing concrete
blocks, flues, and pipes is not recognized as a retail establishment in the
industry and, therefore, would not qualify for exemption under Sec 13(a)(4).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Situations may be encountered where an establishment
engaged in the sale of lumber and other building materials at retail makes or
processes concrete blocks and flues at the establishment and sells them there.
In such a case, where the making or processing of concrete blocks, flues, and
other materials at the establishment is not so extensive as to characterize the
establishment as a manufacturing establishment, and if it is determined that
the establishment as a whole is recognized as a retail establishment and meets
the other tests of Sec 13(a)(2) and Sec 13 (a)(4), the employees making and
processing the concrete blocks and flues will be considered as within the Sec
13(a)(4) exemption.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ec02 - Concrete ready-mix.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An establishment engaged in producing and selling ready-mix
concrete is not recognized as a retail establishment in the industry and,
therefore, cannot qualify for exemption under Sec 13(a)(4).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Since the production and sale of ready-mix concrete is
entirely foreign to the retail concept, employees engaged in making or
processing ready-mix concrete cannot be exempt under Sec 13(a)(4) even though
the establishment may otherwise qualify for the Sec 13(a)(2) exemption.
Further, transit-mixed concrete or any ready-mix concrete with respect to which
some processing in transit is required to keep it in condition for its intended
use at the point of delivery to the customer is not “made or processed at the
retail establishment”.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ec03 - Curtains. slip covers, and draperies.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>An establishment which
sells readymade curtains at retail, and also makes curtains, slip covers, and
draperies to order for private individuals, may be recognized as a retail
establishment under Sec 13(a)(4).</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ed00 - Dairy plants.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Establishments which manufacture milk into butter,
processed cheese, condensed and evaporated milk, ice cream, and the like are
engaged in manufacturing activities and are not recognized as retail.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Establishments engaged in the pasteurization and
consumer distribution of fluid milk may also make and distribute orange drink
and such milk products and byproducts as premium milk, homogenized milk,
regular milk, skim milk, cream, bulk milk, cottage cheese, buttermilk, and sour
cream. Such establishments are not regarded as manufacturing establishments in
the industry, but rather as part of the distributive trade and may be
recognized as retail establishments. The fact that goods made or processed on
the premises are sold by the establishment through outside salesmen will not
defeat the exemption provided all of the other requirements of Sec 13(a)(4) are
met. (See IB 779.348(c).)</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ef00 - Farm implements manufacture.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>An establishment
manufacturing farm implements such as tomato planters, land planes, farm
trailers, harvesting equipment, and fertilizer spreading equipment is not
recognized as a retail establishment in the industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>21ef01 - Fertilizer manufacturers.</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>An establishment
engaged in the manufacture of fertilizer or similar products is not recognized
as a retail establishment.</p>

<h3>21h00 - General provisions and IB 779.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 7(i) provides an exemption from Sec 7(a) for any
employee of a retail or service establishment “if (1) the regular rate of pay
such employee is in excess of one and one-half times the minimum hourly rate
applicable to him under section 6, and (2) more than half his compensation for
a representative period (not less than one month) represents commissions on
goods or services. In determining the proportion of compensation representing
commissions, all earnings resulting from the application of a bona fide
commission rate shall be deemed commissions on goods or services without regard
to whether the computed commissions exceed the draw or guarantee”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Wage-Hour’s position with regard to the application of
the Sec 7(i) exemption is set forth in IB 779.410-779.421.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21h01 - R/K requirements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The R/K requirements
with respect to employees for whom the OT exemption under Sec 7(i) is taken are
set forth in Reg 516.16. While failure to maintain such records would
constitute a R/K violation, it does not in itself invalidate an otherwise
applicable exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21h02 - Representative period for applying Sec 7(i) to new employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   IB 779.417(d) indicates that the same representative
period for purposes of Sec 7(i)(2) may be used for a group of employees where
it can be demonstrated that the factors affecting the proportionate
relationship between total compensation and compensation representing
commissions will be substantially identical for all of the employees in the
group. If a new employee becomes part of a group, all of whom clearly meet the
test of Sec 7(i)(2) based on the representative period designated for them, the
new employee may also be treated for enforcement purposes as meeting the test
of Sec 7(i)(2) from the start of his employment if it can reasonably be
expected that, considering the experience and other qualifications of the new
employee, there will be no significant difference as to the proportionate
relationship between the types of compensation in his situation from that
prevailing for the other members of the group. Similarly, if a new employee is
hired to fill a specific job previously occupied by an employee for whom
substantial information as to compensation is available, and if it can
reasonably be expected that the proportionate compensation for the new employee
will not be substantially different from that of the previous employee, the
period applicable to the previous employee can be applied to the new employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  In situations when it cannot reasonably be expected
that the proportionate compensation of a new employee will correspond to that
shown in the representative period applicable to a group or to the prior
occupant of the position, as may happen, for example, in the case of a new
employee who is inexperienced, Wage-Hour will, for enforcement purposes, permit
the employer to determine compliance with Sec 7(i)(2) on the basis of the new
employee’s earnings experience (of not less than one month) until the completion
of the full representative period applicable to other employees in the
department or establishment.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21h03 - Regular rate determinations under Sec 7(i)(1).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   A week-by-week determination of the regular rate for
purposes of Sec 7(i)(1) is not necessary if the earnings are consistently and
obviously higher than required to meet the test. However, situations may be
encountered where the test is not clearly met and specific determinations of the
regular rate for particular weeks are required. This will present no difficulty
in the ordinary case. However, if the employee is paid commissions under a pay
plan involving balancing factors, complex problems as to the regular rate are
raised. For example, a guarantee plan may operate on a formula basis which
reflects the cumulative effect of the employee’s sales work with the
understanding that additional payments will be made when the amount due from
commissions over the period exceeds the total compensation previously paid. Or,
the guarantee plan may include a provision that if commissions allocable to a
particular w/w fail short of the guarantee the amount of the insufficiency will
be carried forward as a “deficit” and deducted from an “overage” in some future
w/w. In such cases the CO shall obtain the facts as to the operation of the pay
plan and submit the matter through channels to the RS for an opinion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  In determining whether or not the employee’s R/R of
pay is in excess of 1 1/2 times the minimum hourly wage as required by sec
7(i)(1) of the FLSA, the employer may divide the employee’s total earnings
attributed to the pay period by the employee’s total hours worked during such
pay period. Total earnings include commissions, any part of a draw that exceeds
commissions, and supplemental payments, if any, that may have been paid to the
employee. Supplemental payments means payments that have been made in order to
increase the employee’s earnings to an amount in excess of 1 1/2 times the
minimum hourly wage.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21h04 - Commissions computed as a percentage of charges for services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Some retail or service establishments compute an
employee’s compensation on the basis of percentage of the charge to the
customer, such as the charge for labor or the charge for service and parts used
in repair. Compensation computed in this manner “represents commissions on
goods or services” for purposes of applying Sec 7(i). Employees whose
compensation (either in whole or in part) is frequently computed in this
fashion are barbers, beauty shop operators, household appliance repairmen, and
automobile mechanics.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Some auto service garages compensate mechanics or
painters on the basis of commissions which are based on a percentage of the
estimated labor charges to recondition used cars which are subsequently sold.
Such payments “represent commissions on goods or services” for purposes of sec
7(i). The term “commissions or services” includes commissions measured by value
as well as by sale of services and the value of such services is ultimately
reflected in the price of the used cars worked on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Some auto service garages pay employees a flat fee to
recondition used cars which are subsequently sold. Such payments which are paid
without regard to the value of the service performed do not represent
“commissions on goods or services” for purposes of Sec 7(i). Such employees are
considered to be compensated on a piece rate basis and not on the basis of
commissions. Commissions, for purposes of Sec 7(i), usually denotes a
percentage of the amount of monies paid out or received (see (b) above).
(However, see (d) below.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  Some auto service garages and car dealerships
compensate mechanics and painters on the following basis: The painter or
mechanic gets so much a “flat rate” hour for the work he or she performs. A
“flat rate” hour is not an actual clock hour. The painter or mechanic may work
only 7, 8 or 9 hours a day and still receive credit for 10, 11 or 12, etc.,
flat rate hours depending upon how much work he or she has done. Each job is assigned
a certain number of hours for which the customer is charged, regardless of the
actual time it takes to perform the job. The employee is given a certain
proportion of that charge expressed in terms of so many dollars and cents per
“flat rate” hour rather than in terms of a percentage of the charge to the
customer. The dealer does not change the employee’s share per flat rate hour if
the charge to the customer is changed. In such situations Wage-Hour will not
deny that such payments represent “commissions on goods or services” for
purposes of Sec 7(i) (see IB 778.117 and 779.413(b)). Such employment will
qualify for exemption under Sec 7(i) provided all the other tests of the
exemption are met.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21h05 - Failure to choose a representative period.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Reg 516.16, IB 779.415
and 779.417 require the employer to choose a representative period and such
period must be designated and substantiated in the employer’s records. The
absence of such a designation is a violation of the R/K requirements (see FOH
21h01) and may be grounds for denying application of the exemption. However, in
order to avoid unjustifiably penalizing an employer in the case of a first
investigation, retroactive selection of the representative period by the
employer shall be allowed if such period meets the requirements of IB 779.417.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21h06 - Commissions paid to department or store managers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In some cases a
department manager or store manager is paid a commission on all or some of the
sales made by his department or store. For purposes of applying Sec 7(i) to
such a manager, these payments are considered to represent commissions on goods
or services, even though the other employees actually made all or most of the
sales. The role, position and function of the manager greatly contribute to the
sales of his store or department.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21h07 - Service charges may be commissions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   A service charge levied on its customers by an
establishments e.g., hotel, motel, or restaurant, for services rendered by
waiters, waitresses or other such service employees (see FOH 30d04(a)), may
qualify as a “commission” pursuant to Sec 7(i). This is so because a service
charge that is completely or partially paid to such employees is keyed to sales
since it bears a direct relationship to the goods and services which the establishment
sells, and it is a specific percentage of the bill presented to the customer.
Accordingly service employees paid such service charges may qualify for Sec
7(i) if the other tests are met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Tips, however, are not “commissions” for purposes of
Sec 7(i).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21h08 - Laundry and similar establishments excluded from Sec 7(i)
exemption.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 7(i) does not
apply to any employee of an establishment which derives more than 25 percent of
its annual dollar volume from laundering, cleaning, or repairing clothing or
fabrics, including rug and carpet cleaning, or other nonretail activities,
since such an establishment would not qualify as a retail or service
establishment as defined in Sec 13(a)(2). (See also FOH 21cL02 for discussion
of types of establishments included from Sec 13(a)(2).)</p>

<h3>21i00 - General provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Effective 5/1/74, Sec 13(b)(27) of the Act provides an
exemption from the OT provisions for “any employee employed by an establishment
which is a motion picture theater”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  There are no monetary tests under Sec 13(b)(27) nor is
it necessary in order for the exemption to apply that the establishment be a
“retail or service” establishment as defined in Sec 13(a)(2). The exemption may
thus apply without regard to whether or not the establishment is itself a
covered Sec 3(s) enterprise, or is a part of one.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21i01 - Motion picture theater defined.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The definition set out
in IB 779.384 shall be used to identify establishments to which the Sec
13(b)(27) exemption will apply. As a rule-of-thumb the establishment will be
considered to be “primarily engaged in the exhibition of motion pictures” if
50% or more of the presentation time is devoted to the showing of motion
pictures.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21i02 - Application of Sec 13(a)(2).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>While it is not
necessary that an establishment be a “retail or service” establishment for Sec
13(b)(27) to apply, such establishments may qualify for the Sec 13(a)(2)
exemption if the tests are met.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21i03 - Application of Sec 13(a)(3).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Sec 13(a)(3)
exemption may apply to drive-in theaters if the tests are met.</p>

<h3>21k00 - General provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 13(b)(8) of the amended Act, effective 5/1/76,
provided a partial OT exemption for:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“(A) Any employee
(other than an employee of a hotel or motel who performs maid or custodial
services) who is employed by an establishment which is a hotel, motel, or
restaurant and who receives compensation for employment in excess of forty-six
hours in any workweek at a rate not less than one and one-half times the
regular rate at which he or she is employed”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>”(B) Any employees of
a hotel or motel who performs maid or custodial services and who receives
compensation for employment in excess of forty-four hours in any workweek at a
rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he or she
is employed”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Effective 5/1/77, maid and custodial workers in hotels
and motels became entitled to OT compensation after 40 hours in a week; all
other nonexempt employees in hotels and motels and all nonexempt employees in
restaurants remained at a 46 hour week through 1977.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The 1977 Amendments phased out Sec 13(b)(8) in two
steps:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Effective 1/1/78, Sec 13(b)(8) is amended by requiring
OT compensation for hours in excess of 44 per week for employees previously
limited to 46 hours; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Effective 1/1/79, Sec 13(b)(8) is repealed and thus on
that date OT is required for hours over 40 per week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  There are no monetary tests which must be met in order
for the exemption to apply nor is it necessary that the establishment meet the
definitions of a “retail or service establishment”. The exemption may thus
apply without regard to whether or not the establishment is itself a covered
Sec 3(s) enterprise, or is a part of one. (See IB 779.382, 779.383, 779.386,
and 779.387.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21k01 - Applicable OT standard.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>OT compensation at a
rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay must be paid

<h3>21k02 - Maid and custodial workers in hotels and motels.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A “custodial” employee
is one who guards and protects or maintains the premises of the hotel or motel
facility in which he is employed. This includes an employee who performs
janitorial functions, who keeps the facility clean, who tends the heating
system, makes minor repairs, and the like. It includes housemen and gardeners.
It also includes employees of the facility engaged in activities incidental to
the operation of the hotel or motel, such as maids and custodial employees in
the facility’s beauty or barber shops, valet, restaurant, and the like. It
includes employees engaged in laundering, cleaning, or repairing clothing or
fabrics of guests. OT protection is thus afforded to those who have duties such
as laying carpets and rugs and arranging furniture, and to those who have
duties such as making beds, dusting furniture, and replenishing linen.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21k03 - Restaurants in private clubs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   A question has been raised concerning the
applicability to employees of a country club’s dining room of the Sec 13(b)(8)
exemption for “any employee employed by an establishment which is a . . .
restaurant”. Wage-Hour will consider this exemption applicable to employees of
a private club who are engaged in preparing or serving food or beverages on its
premises to its members and guests. Typical of the employees within the
exemption are cooks and kitchen service employees, bus boys, waiter and
waitresses, bartenders, snack bar attendants, and other similar employees
engaged in the preparation and serving of food or beverages on club premises.
In other words, the employees engaged in a club’s food and beverage service
could qualify as employees “employed by an establishment which is a restaurant”
even though their work may take them into other areas of the club premises.
Thus, the food and beverage employees may provide service, for example, to
members and guest at poolside, in the locker rooms, on terraces, on the lawn,
in cardrooms or in other recreation areas without loss of the exemption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  As described in (a) above, our position that these
exemptions will be considered to apply to the club’s food and beverage service
employees has the effect of a general determination, applicable only to such
club’s food and beverage service employees has the effect of a general
determination, applicable only to such clubs, that the employees described will
be considered to qualify under Sec 13(b)(8) as “employed by an establishment
which is a . . .  restaurant”. This means that we will not, in individual
cases, question whether they are “employed by” an identifiable separate establishment
on the premises which is a “restaurant”. The exemption does not apply to other
service employees, such as those who maintain the tennis courts, the swimming
pool, or who attend to the general running of the club even though such
employees may work in the same areas as the food and beverage service
employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The term “private clubs” as used in (a) and (b) above
refers to private clubs where membership requirements disqualify them for the
Sec 13(a)(2) exemption, but which offer to members and guest a meal service of
the kind provided by restaurants. Examples of clubs which may have such
membership restrictions and may offer such restaurant service to members and
guests are country, town, swimming pool, tennis, golf, ski, and beach clubs,
and lodges of fraternal orders.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21k04 - Incidental activities by employees of a restaurant, hotel, or
motel.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Gift items. souvenirs, and tobacco products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees employed by
an establishment which is a hotel, motel, or restaurant in activities connected
with the incidental sale of such items as gifts, souvenirs, and tobacco
products will be considered as within the scope of the business and hence
subject to the exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21k05 - Multi-unit motel, hotel or restaurant organization central
functions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employment in central
functions of a firm operating more than one hotel, motel, or restaurant
establishment, as in the case of employees of a central office, warehouse,
garage, or commissary which serves a chain of exempt hotels, motels, or
restaurants would not be within the exemption since such employees are not
employed by any single exempt establishment.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21k06 - Sec 13(b)(8) may apply to a restaurant engaged in laundering.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Prior to 5/1174, the
Sec 13(b)(8) exemption applied to any employee employed by an establishment
which is a hotel, motel, or restaurant including those engaged in laundering.
Employees of a restaurant engaged in laundering are subject to Sec 13(b)(8).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21k07 - Hotel employees--construction activities.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hotel employees who
engage in work that is in the nature of construction or reconstruction do not
qualify for the Sec 13(b)(8) exemption in any w/w in which they are so engaged.
For example, employees employed by a hotel as maintenance personnel but who
perform renovation construction activities such as tearing down walls, digging
ditches and jackhammer work, are not within the Sec 13(b)(8) exemption in any
w/w that some (there is no tolerance for such nonexempt work) construction work
is performed. (See also FOH 25j13.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21k08 - Campsites and campgrounds.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Campsites and
campgrounds are not considered hotels and motels for purposes of Sec 13(b)(8).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>21k09 - “Restaurant” defined.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   General guidance in defining “restaurant” is contained
in IB 779.387. A “restaurant” may be further identified as an establishment
engaged in serving prepared food and beverages selected by the patron from a
full menu. Waiter or waitress service is usually provided (except in some
cafeterias) and the establishment has dining (seating) facilities and
equipment. Thus, establishments known as cafes, cafeterias, coffee shops,
diners, dining rooms, lunchrooms, tea rooms, etc., may qualify as
“restaurants”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  There are many types of retail establishments that
sell prepared food or beverages for consumption on the premises or for
immediate consumption that are clearly not “restaurants”, such as drinking
places, social caterers, and ice cream and frozen custard stands. This
distinction is not so readily apparent with respect to establishments, such as
quick-service food establishments, primarily engaged in selling limited lines
of refreshments and prepared food items, such as hamburgers, fried and
barbecued chicken, pizza, etc., for consumption on or near the premises or for
“take-home” consumption. Such establishments range from “carryouts”, which have
no seating facilities and cannot qualify as “restaurants”, to establishments
that have tables and booths, parking for eating in one’s car, and “take-home”
containers. Whether a quick-service food establishment is a “restaurant”
pursuant to Sec 13(b)(8) depends on the facts in a particular situation. Such
quick-service food establishments that do not provide the characteristic
employee services and the physical and functional equipment and furnishings
that patrons require for consumption of meals on the premises are not
“restaurants” for purposes of Sec 13(b)(8). On the other hand, where a
particular quick-service food establishment does provide the customary employee
and dining room services, pursuant to the above and IB 779.387, WH will not
deny the exemption. As in cafeterias, the fact that waiters and waitresses may
not be employed would not alter this position. The present examples in IB
779.387 of “refreshment stands” and “lunch counters” should be interpreted in
the light of and consistent with the discussion above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The case of Foodservice and Lodging Institute. Inc..
et al. v. Dunlop which challenged the above position, has been tried in the
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. On 9/30/75, the court stated
that it appeared the plaintiffs (Institute, et al.) “failed to establish that
the ruling and opinion letter challenged herein are plainly unreasonable or in
conflict with the intent of Congress . . . .“ The Court granted the Secretary’s
motion for Summary Judgment and denied Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief
and dismissed the case with prejudice. The Institute has filed a Notice of
Appeal on the case, however. If the Department prevails in the appeal process,
the Institute will not be able to raise this challenge on its merits again.
They will have to wait for a specific case to try the issues. WH will continue
to apply such exemptions under the guidelines of FOH 21k09 and IB 779.387.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  The “on the premises” test referred to above does not
necessarily mean a physical structure. For example, a garden restaurant or
sidewalk cafe could qualify as a restaurant if it provides the customary
employee and dining room services and facilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Where the patrons of a drive-in food service
establishment with no seating facilities are served in their cars, the
establishment is not a restaurant within the meaning of the exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22a00. Regulations: part 541 (29 CFR part 541).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR part 541 defines the terms “executive” (541.100), “administrative”
(541.200), “professional” (541.300), “computer” (541.400), and “outside sales”
(541.500) employees for purposes of the 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) exemption from
minimum wage and overtime.  29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(17) exempts computer
systems analysts, computer programmers, software engineers, and other similarly
skilled workers in the computer field from minimum wage and overtime if they
meet the prescribed duties tests, as discussed in 29 CFR §§ 541.400 through 541.402,
and they receive the proper level of pay.</p>

<p>The
effective date of the revised exemption tests under 29 CFR part 541 is

<h3>22a02.             Scope of 541 exemptions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>29
U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) exemptions apply only to certain types of “white collar”
employees who meet the salary and duties tests and who are employed as bona
fide executive, administrative, professional, computer, and outside sales
employees, as 29 CFR part 541 defines each of these terms.  Manual laborers or
other “blue collar” workers do not qualify for exemption under 29 CFR part 541.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR  § 541.3(b) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22a03.             Exemption period.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
exemptions provided by 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) are applied on the basis that each
workweek constitutes a separate period of exemption.  However, certain of the
tests are so worded that a determination of exemption must be made by
considering the conditions of employment over a more extended period of time. 
For example, the “primary duty” test does not expressly apply on a workweek
basis and must be applied using a holistic approach that is sufficient to
capture the character of the employee’s job as a whole (29 CFR § 541.700; 69 FR
22186), rather than a day-by-day scrutiny of the tasks performed.  Similarly,
an employee may be paid the salary required during certain workweeks, but an
analysis of the compensation paid over a longer period may reveal that the
employee is not actually paid “on a salary basis.”  Likewise, investigation may
reveal that a supervisor does not “customarily and regularly” direct the work
of two or more employees in his or her department, despite the fact that in
particular weeks the supervisor may supervise more than one employee.  It must
always be kept in mind, however, that a change in an employee’s duties,
responsibilities, or salary (even though temporary) may bring a change in
exemption status.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22a04.             Job titles and job descriptions insufficient.</h3>

<p>(a)  
29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) exemptions do not apply to employees
training for employment in an executive, administrative, professional, outside
sales or computer employee capacity who are not actually performing the duties
required for exemption as a bona fide executive, administrative, professional,
outside sales or computer employee. </p>

However, time spent by an exempt store manager attending a
several week management training program which will qualify the manager for
placement in a higher level management position will not result in loss of
exemption for the manager for the time spent in the training program. The
manager’s primary duty is not changed by the mere fact that the manager attends
such a training program.</p>

<p>When
an employee performs work in more than one capacity for an employer, for
example, an office assistant, -a position that is typically nonexempt, and as a
manager - a position that is typically exempt, the standard for determining
whether the combined duties are exempt is the primary duty test, which considers
the character of the employee’s job viewed as a whole. If the exempt managerial
duties are the primary duty, the employee will be exempt. If the nonexempt
office assistant duties are the primary duty, the employee will be nonexempt.
If the employee is determined to be nonexempt, normal regular rate principles
apply in calculating overtime due to the employee.</p>

<h3>22b00. Criteria for exemption of “executive” employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
To be exempt as a bona fide “executive” under 29 CFR § 541.100,
all of the following tests must be met:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employee
must be compensated on a “salary basis” at a rate not less than $455/wk
($380/wk if employed in American Samoa by employers other than the Federal
government), exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The employee’s
primary duty must be management of the enterprise in which employed (or a
customarily recognized department or subdivision thereof),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The employee
must customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more other employees,
and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The employee
must have the authority to hire or fire other employees, or the employee’s
suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement,
promotion or any other change of status of other employees must be given
particular weight.</p>

<h3>22b01. Primary duty test for executive employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
An exempt executive employee’s primary duty must be
management of the enterprise in which employed, or management of a customarily
recognized department or subdivision of the enterprise.  “Primary duty” is
defined in 29 CFR § 541.700 as the principal, main, major or most important
duty the employee performs, determined by examining all the facts in each case
with the major emphasis on the character of the employee’s job as a whole.  The
amount of time spent performing exempt work can be a useful guide in answering
this question, but time alone is not the sole test.  The regulations do not
require that employees spend more than 50 percent of their time performing
exempt work to qualify for exemption.  Thus, while employees who spend more
than half their time performing exempt work will generally satisfy the primary
duty requirement, employees who do not spend more than half their time
performing exempt duties may still meet the primary duty requirement if other
factors support that conclusion.  Factors to consider include, but are not
limited to, the relative importance of the exempt duties compared with other
duties, the amount of time spent performing exempt work, the employee’s relative
freedom from direct supervision, and the relationship between the employee’s
salary and the wages paid to other employees for the kind of nonexempt work
performed by the employee.  For example, managers in retail establishments who
perform exempt executive duties such as supervising and directing the work of
other employees, ordering merchandise, managing the budget and authorizing
payment of bills may have management as their primary duty even if they spend
more than 50 percent of the time performing nonexempt work such as running the
cash register.  However, if a particular manager is closely supervised and
earns little more than the nonexempt employees, such a manager generally would
not satisfy the primary duty requirement.  See also FOH 22b04 and 29 CFR § 541.106.

“Customarily recognized department or subdivision” means a
recognized subpart, within the larger business unit, which has a permanent
status and continuing function.  The term is intended to distinguish between a
mere collection of employees assigned from time to time to a specific job or
series of jobs and a recognized unit with permanent status and function.  Each
separate establishment of a multi-establishment enterprise qualifies as a
recognized subdivision.  However, a recognized subdivision need not be
physically within the employer’s establishment, and may even move from place to
place.  An employee may work in more than one location without invalidating the
exemption if factors show the employee is actually in charge of a recognized
unit with a continuing function in the employer’s organization.  Continuity of
the same subordinate personnel is also not required; an otherwise exempt
employee does not lose the exemption simply because the employee obtains and
supervises workers from a pool or supervises a team of workers from other
recognized units.  Examples of  “department or subdivision” include such
groupings as a shift; a functional area, i.e. “back of the house, front of the
house” in a store or restaurant; or a small group or team of  employees who work
on a related project within a larger group.</p>

<b>Primary duty during a strike period.  </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>During
a strike, otherwise exempt executive, administrative, and professional
employees often perform the work of nonexempt “rank and file” employees, which
raises a question as to their exemption status under 29 CFR part 541.  The
primary duty test does not expressly apply on a workweek basis. See 29 CFR §
541.700 and FOH 22a03.  In Marshall v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 621 F.2d
1246 (3rd Cir. 1980), which involved a three-month strike period, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that the primary duty requirement
then existing in the regulation’s “short test” for high-salaried managerial
employees could not be applied on a workweek basis (or over any specific
timeframe under the regulatory language).  Based on this ruling, WHD will, on a
nationwide basis, deem the primary duty test to be satisfied during a strike
period, provided that the otherwise exempt employee who performs nonexempt work
during that period (1) satisfied the primary duty test prior to the strike and
(2) is paid on a salary basis at a rate not less than the required weekly
amount of $455 during the strike.</p>

<h3>22b02. Supervision of two or more other employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Whether an employee “customarily and regularly directs the
work of two or more other employees” under 29 CFR § 541.100(a)(3) depends on
all the facts. “Customarily and regularly” means greater than occasional but
may be less than constant; it includes work normally and recurrently performed
every workweek, but does not include isolated or one-time tasks.  The fact that
an occasional workweek passes when an otherwise exempt executive does not give
direct instructions to subordinate employees will not defeat the exemption,
provided the executive in fact customarily and regularly directs the
subordinate employees’ work.  In addition, in certain instances, a supervisor
(such as a district sales manager) may not work at the same time or within the
same establishment as the assigned subordinates being supervised; this will not
defeat the exemption if the criteria of 29 CFR § 541.100(a)(3) in fact are
met.  </p>

<p>WHD
Opinion Letter FLSA 2006-35 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
“Two or more other employees” means two full-time employees
or the equivalent (29 CFR § 541.104).  For example, one full-time and two
half-time employees are equivalent to two full-time employees.  Four half-time
employees are also equivalent to two full-time employees.  Full-time generally
means someone who works 40 or more hours per week.  If occasional, temporary or
part-time employees are involved when determining if the two full-time employee
equivalency is met, an exempt executive must supervise two or more employees
for a combined total of 80 hours of work by such employees.  In other words,
the total number of hours worked by subordinate employees supervised must
ordinarily total 80 within the workweek to qualify as the equivalent of two
full-time employees. If a full-time employee works over 40 hours in the
workweek, he or she counts as the equivalent of only one employee. For example,
if a full-time employee works 60 hours per week and a part-time employee works
20 hours per week, although the two employees together work a total of 80
hours, an equivalent of only one full-time and one part-time employee is
supervised, thereby not meeting the criteria. Only other employees of the
employer may be considered when determining if the two full-time employee
equivalency is met; supervision of volunteers, employees of independent
contractors, or any other “non-employees” (trainees, interns) in relation to
the employer are not considered for purposes of this test. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The supervisory function can be distributed among two,
three or more exempt executives, but each executive must customarily and
regularly direct the work of two or more other full-time employees or the
equivalent.  For example, a department with five full-time nonexempt workers
may have up to two exempt supervisors if each supervisor customarily and
regularly directs the work of two full-time nonexempt workers.  However, the
hours worked by a subordinate employee may not be counted or credited more than
once for different executives. Thus, shared responsibility to supervise the
same two employees in the same department does not meet the requirement that
the executive direct the work of two or more employees or their equivalent.  On
the other hand, a full-time employee who works half of the time for one
supervisor and the other half of the time for a different supervisor may be
credited as a half-time employee for each of the supervisors.  However, if a
full-time employee usually works more than 40 hours per week and the employer
wants to “split” this employee’s time evenly between two supervisors, then each
supervisor is still supervising only one-half of this full-time employee’s
time.  Subdividing one full-time employee’s time between more than one
supervisor for purposes of this test should never add up to more than one
full-time employee</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also,
there is no requirement that the manager work at the same time or at the same
location as the subordinates in order to qualify for the exemption, as long as
the manager regularly directs the subordinate’s work.</p>

WHD has occasionally accepted a lower full-time workweek
standard but only when unusual circumstances justified it in an industry (and
never because an individual employer’s rules defined full-time as something
less than 40 hours per week for purposes of pension or benefit plan
participation or other reasons). The exception was limited to firms in
industries that had established workweeks of 37 ½ or 35 hours for full-time
employees, such as banking and insurance in the 1970s. For example, banks
historically operated fewer hours each week compared to their normal business
operations today – i.e., they were closed to the public by mid-afternoon on
most weekdays and did not open for business on weekends (thus, the term
“banker’s hours” became known as a reference to a reduced workweek schedule
compared to the norm). Such qualifying circumstances no longer appear to be
present in the banking and insurance industries today. In the 2004 revisions to
the 541 regulations, WHD reinforced “its current interpretation that an exempt
supervisor generally must direct a total of 80 employee-hours of work each
week.” 69 FR 22135 (April 23, 2004) See also Perez v. Radioshack Corporation,
386 F. Supp. 2d 979, 990 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (to “customarily and regularly”
direct work of two or more full-time employees, an exempt executive must
supervise 80 or more hours of subordinates’ time at least 80 percent of the
time to indicate frequency greater than occasional but less than constant). </p>

<h3>22b03. Authority to hire or fire, particular weight.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>To
qualify as an exempt executive, an employee must have the authority to hire or
fire other employees, or have his or her suggestions and recommendations as to
the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of
other employees be given “particular weight.”  Factors considered when
determining if an employee’s recommendations as to hiring, firing, advancement,
promotion or any other change of status are given “particular weight” include
whether it is part of the employee’s job duties to make such recommendations,
and the frequency with which such recommendations are made, requested, and
relied upon.  For example, an employee who provides few recommendations that
are never followed would not meet the requirement of 29 CFR § 541.100(a)(4). 
Generally, an executive’s recommendations must pertain to employees whom the
executive customarily and regularly directs or supervises.  It does not include
occasional suggestions regarding co-workers.  An employee’s recommendations may
still be deemed to have “particular weight” even if a higher level manager’s
recommendation has more importance and even if the employee does not have
authority to make the ultimate decision as to the employee’s change in status,
such as where a higher level manager or a personnel board makes the final
hiring, promotion or termination decision.  “Other change of status” refers to
tangible employment actions and means a significant change in employment
status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with
significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant
change in benefits.  A supervisor who provides recommendations on any one of
the specified changes in employment status may be considered to meet the
requirement of 29 CFR § 541.100(a)(4). </p>

<h3>22b04. Concurrent performance of exempt and nonexempt duties.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Concurrently
(or simultaneously) performing both exempt and nonexempt duties does not
automatically disqualify an otherwise exempt employee from the executive
exemption if all the requirements for exemption are met.  For example, if the
primary duty of a manager of a retail food service establishment is management
of that establishment, performing work such as serving customers or cooking
food during peak customer periods would not preclude exempt status.  Generally,
exempt executives make the decision regarding when to perform nonexempt duties
and remain responsible for the success or failure of business operations under their
management while performing such nonexempt tasks, and can both supervise
subordinate employees and serve customers at the same time without being
disqualified from the exemption.  In contrast, the nonexempt employee generally
is directed by a supervisor to perform the exempt work or performs the exempt
work for defined time periods.  An employee whose primary duty is ordinary
production work or routine, recurrent or repetitive tasks does not qualify for
exemption as an executive even if the employee also has some supervisory
responsibilities.  A relief supervisor or working supervisor whose primary duty
is performing nonexempt work on the production line in a manufacturing plant
does not become exempt merely because the nonexempt production line employee
occasionally has some responsibility for directing the work of other nonexempt
production line employees when, for example, the exempt supervisor is not
available.  Nonexempt employees do not become exempt executives simply because
they direct the work of other employees upon occasion or provide input on
performance issues from time to time; such employees typically would not meet
the other requirements of 29 CFR § 541.100 (such as having a primary duty of
management).  Whether an employee is exempt as an executive while performing
concurrent duties must be determined on a case-by-case basis according to the
factors set forth in 29 CFR § 541.700.  See 29 CFR § 541.703 for a discussion
of work that is “directly and closely related” to the performance of exempt
work and is, therefore, also considered exempt work, and the examples discussed
therein to illustrate types of work that are or are not considered “directly
and closely related” to exempt work.</p>

<h3>22b05. Exemption of business owners with 20 percent equity interest.</h3>

<p>An
employee who owns at least a bona fide 20-percent equity interest in the
enterprise in which employed, regardless of the type of business organization
(e.g., corporation, partnership, or other), and who is actively engaged in its
management, is considered a bona fide exempt executive.  The salary and salary
basis requirements do not apply to the exemption of business owners under 29 CFR
§ 541.101. An individual with a 20 percent or greater interest in a business
who is required to work long hours, makes no management decisions, supervises
no one and has no authority over personnel does not qualify for the executive
exemption. To qualify for the exemption, a minority owner with at least a
bona-fide 20 percent interest in the business must be actively engaged in its management.

<h3>22c00.             Criteria for exemption of “administrative” employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
To be exempt as a bona fide “administrative” employee under
29 CFR § 541.200, all of the following tests must be met:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employee
must be compensated on a “salary” or “fee” basis (as defined in the
regulations) at a rate of not less than $455/wk ($380/wk if employed in
American Samoa by employers other than the Federal government), exclusive of
board, lodging or other facilities, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The employee’s
primary duty must be the performance of office or non-manual work directly
related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the
employer’s customers, and </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The employee’s
primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with
respect to matters of significance. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
“Salary basis” and “fee basis” are defined at 29 CFR §§
541.602 and 541.605, respectively. See FOH 22g02.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22c01.             Primary duty test for administrative employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
An exempt administrative employee’s primary duty must be
the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management
or general business operations of the employer or of the employer’s customers.  For
further explanation of the term “primary duty” see the discussion under
“executive” at FOH 22b01.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Office or non-manual work.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
administrative exemption applies only to employees whose primary duty is the
performance of office or non-manual work.  Thus, for example, production line
workers and employees in maintenance, construction and similar occupations who
perform work involving repetitive operations with their hands, physical skill
and energy are not exempt as administrative employees.  For a discussion of
manual laborers and other “blue collar” workers outside the scope of the “white
collar” exemptions. See 29 CFR § 541.3 and FOH 22a02.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Directly related to management or general business
operations.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
phrase “directly related to management or general business operations” refers
to the type of work performed by the employee.  To meet this requirement, an
employee must perform work directly related to assisting with the running or
servicing of the business, as distinguished, for example, from working on a
manufacturing production line or selling a product in a retail or service
establishment.  Work “directly related to management or general business
operations” includes, but is not limited to, work in functional areas such as
tax, finance, accounting, budgeting, auditing, insurance, quality control,
purchasing, procurement, advertising, marketing, research, safety and health,
personnel management, human resources, employee benefits, labor relations,
public relations, government relations, computer network, Internet and database
administration, legal and regulatory compliance, and similar activities.  This
list is intended only to be illustrative.  It is not intended as a complete
listing of exempt areas, nor is it intended as a listing of specific jobs; rather,
it is a list of functional areas or departments that generally relate to
management and general business operations of an employer or an employer’s
customers, although each case must be examined individually.  Within such
areas, it is still necessary to analyze the level or nature of the work
performed (i.e., does the employee exercise discretion and independent judgment
as to matters of significance) in order to determine if the administrative
exemption applies.  Whether a particular employee primarily performs exempt
work depends on the actual duties performed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
production versus staff dichotomy is a useful analytical tool in evaluating
whether an employee’s primary duty is work directly related to management or
general business operations.  See 69 FR 22140 – 22142.  Courts have noted that
determining whether the administrative exemption applies is not as simple as a
drawing the line between “white collar” and “blue collar” employees. Rather,
non-manufacturing employees can be considered to be “production” employees if
their job is to generate the product or service that their employer’s business
offers to the public. The distinction is between those employees whose primary
duty is administering the business affairs of the enterprise from those whose
primary duty is producing the commodity or commodities, whether goods or
services, that the enterprise exists to produce and market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Employer’s customers.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>An
employee may qualify for the administrative exemption if the employee’s primary
duty is work directly related to the management or general business operations
of the employer’s customers, rather than those of the employer.  Thus,
employees acting as advisors or consultants to their employer’s clients or
customers – such as tax experts or financial consultants, for example - may be
exempt.  Nothing in 29 CFR part 541 precludes the administrative exemption
because the customer is an individual, rather than a business, as long as the
work performed relates to “management or general business operations.”  While
the exemption would not apply when the client’s or customer’s “business” is
purely personal, providing expert advice to a small business owner or a sole
proprietor regarding management and general business operations would be an
exempt administrative function.  For example, many bona fide administrative
employees perform important functions as advisors or consultants in analyzing
and recommending changes in business operations but are employed by an entity
engaged in furnishing such services to others for a fee (e.g., management
consultants).  Such employees, if they meet the other requirements of the
regulations, would qualify for exemption regardless of whether the management
or general business operations to which their work is directly related are
those of the employer’s clients or customers, or those of their employer.  This
provision is meant to place administratively exempt work done for a client or
customer on the same footing as such work done for the employer directly,
regardless of whether the client is a sole proprietor or a “Fortune 500”
company, as long as the work directly relates to “management or general
business operations.”</p>

<h3>22c02.             Discretion and independent judgment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
To qualify for the administrative exemption, an employee’s
primary duty must include the exercise of discretion and independent judgment
with respect to matters of significance.  The exercise of discretion and
independent judgment involves the comparison and the evaluation of possible
courses of conduct and acting or making a decision after the various
possibilities have been considered.  The term must be applied in light of all
the facts of the employee’s particular employment situation, and implies that the
employee has authority to make an independent choice, free from immediate
direction or supervision.  Factors to consider include, but are not limited to
whether the employee has authority to formulate, affect, interpret, or
implement management policies or operating practices; whether the employee
carries out major assignments in conducting the operations of the business;
whether the employee performs work that affects business operations to a
substantial degree (even if the work relates to operation of only a particular
segment of the business); whether the employee has authority to commit the
employer in matters that have significant financial impact; whether the
employee has authority to waive or deviate from established policies and
procedures without prior approval; whether the employee has authority to
negotiate and bind the company on significant matters; whether the employee
provides consultation or expert advice to management; whether the employee is
involved in planning long- or short-term business objectives; whether the
employee investigates and resolves matters of significance on behalf of
management; and whether the employee represents the employer in handling
complaints, arbitrating disputes or resolving grievances.  Federal courts
generally find that employees who meet at least two or three of these factors
are exercising discretion and independent judgment, although a case-by-case
analysis is required.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>69
FR 22143 through 22144</p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.202(a), (b), and (c) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The fact that an employee’s decisions or recommendations
are on occasion revised or reversed after higher review does not mean that the
employee is not exercising discretion and independent judgment.  For example,
the credit policies formulated by the credit manager of a large corporation may
be subject to review by higher company officials who may approve or disapprove
these policies.  A management consultant who has studied the operations of a
business and proposed changes in organization may have the plan reviewed or
revised by superiors before it is submitted to the client.  These factors do
not detract from the fact that the work of these employees includes the
exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of
significance directly related to management or general business operations.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.202(c) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The exercise of discretion and independent judgment must be
more than the use of skill in applying well-established techniques, procedures
or specific standards described in manuals or other sources. Exempt employees
may use manuals, guidelines or other established procedures if they contain or
relate to highly technical, scientific, legal, financial or other similarly
complex matters that can be understood or interpreted only by those with
advanced or specialized knowledge or skills.  Employees who simply apply
well-established techniques or procedures within closely prescribed limits,
however, are not exempt.  The exercise of discretion and independent judgment
also does not include clerical or secretarial work; recording or tabulating
data; or performing other mechanical, repetitive, recurrent or routine work. 
An employee who simply tabulates data is not exempt even if labeled a
“statistician.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR §§ 541.202(e), 541.704 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
The term “matters of significance” refers to the level of
importance or consequence of the work performed to the management or general
business operations of the employer or of the employer’s customers.  An
employee does not exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to
matters of significance merely because the employer will experience financial
losses if the employee fails to perform the job properly.  A messenger, for
example, who is entrusted with carrying large sums of money does not exercise
discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance
even though serious consequences may result from the employee’s neglect. 
Similarly, an employee who operates very expensive equipment does not exercise
discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance
merely because improper performance of the employee’s duties may cause serious
financial loss to the employer.  </p>

<h3>22d00.             Types of professional employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
professional exemption includes three types: “learned,” “creative,” and
“teaching.”  Each type is defined separately in 29 CFR part 541 according to
its own specific duties tests.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22d01. Criteria for exemption of “learned” professional employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="4"></a>(a)  
To be exempt as a bona fide learned professional employee
under 29 CFR §§ 541.300 and 541.301, all of the following tests must be met:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employee
must be compensated on a <a href="http://www.dol.gov/esa/regs/compliance/whd/fairpay/fs17g_salary.htm">salary</a>
or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate of not less than $455/wk
($380/wk if employed in American Samoa by employers other than the Federal
government), exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The employee’s
primary duty must be the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge,
defined as work which is predominantly intellectual in character and which
includes work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The advanced
knowledge must be in a field of science or learning, and </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The advanced
knowledge must be customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized
intellectual instruction. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
“Salary basis” and “fee basis” are defined at 29 CFR §§ 541.602
and 541.605, respectively. See FOH 22g02 and 22g07.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22d02.             Primary duty test for “learned” professional employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
An exempt “learned” professional employee’s primary duty
must be the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of
science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized
intellectual instruction (29 CFR § 541.301(a)).  For further explanation of the
term “primary duty,”see the discussion under “executive” at FOH 22b01.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.301(a) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
“Work requiring advanced knowledge” means work which is
predominantly intellectual in character, and which includes work requiring the
consistent exercise of discretion and judgment.  Learned professional work is
therefore distinguished from work involving routine mental, manual, mechanical
or physical work.  A learned professional employee generally uses the advanced
knowledge to analyze, interpret or make deductions from varying facts or
circumstances.  Advanced knowledge cannot be attained at the high school
level.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.301(b)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
“Field(s) of science or learning” include law, medicine,
theology, accounting, actuarial computation, engineering, architecture,
teaching, various types of physical, chemical and biological sciences, pharmacy
and other similar occupations that have a recognized professional status and
can be distinguished from the mechanical arts or skilled trades where the
knowledge could be of a fairly advanced type, but is not in a field of science
or learning. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.301(c) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
The phrase “customarily acquired by a prolonged course of
specialized intellectual instruction” restricts the learned professional
exemption to professions where specialized academic training is a standard
prerequisite for entrance into the profession.  The best evidence of meeting
this requirement is having the appropriate academic degree for the particular
profession.  However, the word “customarily” means the exemption is available
to employees in such professions who have substantially the same knowledge
level and perform substantially the same work as the degreed employees, but who
attained the advanced knowledge through a combination of work experience and
intellectual instruction.  Thus, for example, the learned professional
exemption is available to the occasional lawyer who has not gone to law school,
or the occasional chemist who does not possess a degree in chemistry.  However,
the learned professional exemption is not available for occupations that
require only a four-year degree in any field or a two-year degree as a
prerequisite for entrance into the field. The learned professional exemption is
not available for occupations that customarily may be performed with knowledge
acquired through an apprenticeship, or with training in the performance of routine
mental, manual, mechanical or physical processes.  The learned professional
exemption also does not apply to occupations in which most employees acquire
their skill by experience rather than by advanced specialized intellectual
instruction.  </p>

FR 22150</p>
<p>WHD
Letter FLSA 2005-35NA </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Accredited
curriculums and certification programs are relevant to determining exempt
learned professional status only to the extent they provide evidence that a
prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction has become a standard
prerequisite for entrance into the profession.  Neither the identity of the
certifying organization nor the mere fact that certification is required is
determinative if certification does not involve a prolonged course of
specialized intellectual instruction.  For example, certified physicians
assistants meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption
because certification requires four years of specialized post-secondary school
instruction; employees with cosmetology licenses are not exempt as learned
professionals because the licenses do not require a prolonged course of
specialized intellectual instruction.  In addition, the fact that an employee
possesses a license to practice a certain profession must be considered along
with all the other criteria in determining the exempt status of the employee. 
The possession of a license permitting an employee to perform duties which
would meet the tests of an exempt employee under 29 CFR part 541 does not make
that employee necessarily exempt.  In order for an employee to meet the duties
tests under 29 CFR part 541, the employee must actually perform exempt duties. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>69
FR 22157</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
The areas in which the professional exemption may be
available are expanding.  As knowledge is developed, academic training is
broadened and specialized degrees are offered in new and diverse fields, thus
creating new specialists in particular fields of science or learning.  When an
advanced specialized degree has become a standard requirement for  entrance
into a particular occupation, that occupation may have acquired the
characteristics of a learned profession.  Accrediting and certifying
organizations similar to those listed in 29 CFR § 541.301(e)(1), (e)(3),
(e)(4), (e)(8) and (e)(9) also may be created in the future.  Such
organizations may develop similar specialized curriculums and certification
programs which, if a standard requirement for a particular occupation, may
indicate that the occupation has acquired the characteristics of a learned
profession.  </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22d03. Special exceptions for the practice of law or medicine.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Special provisions in 29 CFR § 541.304 exempt, as bona fide
learned professionals:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Any employee
who holds a valid license or certificate permitting the practice of law or
medicine or any of their branches, and is actually engaged in the practice
thereof, and </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Any employee
who holds the requisite academic degree for the general practice of medicine,
and is engaged in an internship or resident program pursuant to the practice of
the profession.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
This exemption applies to physicians and other
practitioners licensed and practicing in the field of medical science and
healing or any of the medical specialties practiced by physicians or practitioners. 
“Physicians” includes medical doctors including general practitioners and
specialists, osteopathic physicians (doctors of osteopathy), podiatrists,
dentists (doctors of dental medicine), and optometrists (doctors of optometry
or bachelors of science in optometry).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Employees engaged in internship or resident programs,
whether or not licensed to practice prior to commencement of the program,
qualify as exempt learned professionals if they enter such internship or
resident programs after earning the appropriate degree required for the general
practice of their profession.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
The minimum salary and salary or fee basis requirements do
not apply to the employees described in this section.  NOTE:  In the case of
occupations in the medical field, the exception from the salary or fee
requirement does not apply to pharmacists, nurses, therapists, technologists,
sanitarians, dieticians, social workers, psychologists, psychometrists, physician
assistants, nurse practitioners or other professions which service the medical
profession. </p>

<h3>22d04. Criteria for exemption of “creative” professional employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
To be exempt as a bona fide “creative” professional
employee under 29 CFR §§ 541.300 and 541.302, all of the following tests must
be met:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employee
must be compensated on a <a href="http://www.dol.gov/esa/regs/compliance/whd/fairpay/fs17g_salary.htm">salary</a>
or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate of not less than $455/wk
($380/wk if employed in American Samoa by employers other than the Federal
government), exclusive of board, lodging, or other facilities, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The employee’s
primary duty must be the performance of work requiring invention, imagination,
originality or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
“Salary basis” and “fee basis” are defined at 29 CFR §§ 541.602
and 541.605, respectively.  See FOH 22g02 and 22g07</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22d05. Primary duty test for “creative” professional employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
An exempt “creative” professional employee’s primary duty
must be the performance of work requiring invention, imagination, originality,
or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor, as opposed to
routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work.  This requirement
distinguishes the creative professions from work that primarily depends on
intelligence, diligence and accuracy.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Exemption as a creative professional depends upon how much
invention, imagination, originality or talent the employee exercises.  Whether
the exemption applies, therefore, is determined on a case-by-case basis.  The
requirements are generally met by actors, musicians, composers, conductors, and
soloists; painters who are given at most the subject matter of their painting;
cartoonists who are told only the title or underlying concept for a cartoon and
must rely on their own creative ability to express the concept; essayists,
novelists, short story writers and screenplay writers who choose their own
subjects and submit completed works to their employers; and persons in the more
responsible writing positions in advertising agencies.  Someone employed as a
copyist, as an animator of motion picture cartoons, or as a re-toucher of
photographs would not meet the requirements since such work is not properly
described as creative in character.  Journalists may satisfy the duties
requirements for the creative professional exemption if their primary duty is
work requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent, as opposed to
work that depends primarily on intelligence, diligence and accuracy. 
Journalists are not exempt creative professionals if they only collect,
organize and record information that is routine or already public, or if they do
not contribute a unique interpretation or analysis to a news product. Reporters
who merely re-write press releases or who write standard recounts of public
information by gathering facts on routine community events are not exempt
creative professionals. Reporters whose work products are subject to
substantial control by their employer also do not qualify as exempt creative
professionals.  See also FOH 22i25.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.302(c) &amp; (d) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
To qualify for exemption as a creative professional, the
work performed must be “in a recognized field of artistic or creative
endeavor.”  This includes such fields as music, writing, acting and the graphic
arts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.302</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22d06. Criteria for exemption of teachers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
To be exempt as a bona fide teacher under 29 CFR § 541.303,
all of the following tests must be met:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employee’s
primary duty must be teaching, tutoring, instructing or lecturing in the
activity of imparting knowledge, and </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The employee
must be employed and engaged in the teaching activity as a teacher in an
“educational establishment” (as defined in 29 CFR § 541.204(b)) by which the
employee is employed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.303 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
There is no minimum salary or “salary basis” requirement
applied to teaching professionals. See 29 CFR § 541.303(d).  In addition, there
is no minimum educational or academic degree requirement for bona fide teaching
professionals in educational establishments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.303(d) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Exempt teachers include (but are not limited to): regular
academic teachers; teachers of kindergarten or nursery school pupils; teachers
of gifted or disabled children; teachers of skilled and semiskilled trades and
occupations; teachers engaged in automobile driving instruction; aircraft
flight instructors; home economics teachers; and vocal or instrumental music
instructors.  Faculty members engaged as teachers who also spend a considerable
amount of their time in extracurricular activities such as coaching athletic
teams or acting as moderators or advisors in such areas as drama, speech, debate
or journalism are engaged in teaching.  Such extracurricular activities are a
recognized part of the schools’ responsibility in contributing to the
educational development of the student.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.303(b) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Possession of an elementary or secondary teacher’s
certificate identifies the individuals who are considered within the scope of
the exemption for teaching professionals.  Teachers who possess a teaching
certificate qualify for the exemption regardless of the terminology (e.g.,
permanent, conditional, standard, provisional, temporary, emergency, or
unlimited) used by the State to refer to different kinds of certificates. 
However, private schools and public schools are not uniform in requiring a
certificate for employment as an elementary or secondary school teacher, and a
teacher’s certificate is not generally necessary for employment in institutions
of higher education or other educational establishments.  Therefore, a teacher
who is not certified may be considered for exemption, provided that such
individual is employed as a teacher by the employing school or school system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.303(c) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
“The term ‘educational establishment’ means an elementary
or secondary school system, an institution of higher education or other
educational institution.  Sections 3(v) and 3(w) of the Act define elementary
and secondary schools as those day or residential schools that provide
elementary or secondary education, as determined under State law.  Under the
laws of most States, such education includes the curriculums in grades 1
through 12. Under many it includes also the introductory programs in
kindergarten, and some States may also include nursery school programs in
elementary education and junior college curriculums in secondary education.  The
term ‘other educational establishment’ includes special schools for mentally or
physically disabled or gifted children, regardless of any classification of
such schools as elementary, secondary or higher.  Factors relevant in
determining whether post-secondary career programs qualify as educational
institutions include whether the school is licensed by a state agency
responsible for the state’s educational system or accredited by a nationally
recognized accrediting organization for career schools.  Also, for purposes of
the exemption, no distinction is drawn between public and private schools, or
between those operated for profit and those that are not for profit.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>An
employee who holds a full-time nonexempt position with an educational
institution, who is also employed to teach a course at night, has the full-time
nonexempt position as the primary duty. In such cases, all hours suffered or
permitted to work, including out of class preparation time, must be counted
when determining the total hours worked. Overtime due may be computed using
regular rate principles, or by applying the provisions of 29 U.S.C. § 207(g)(2)
if the requirements for their use  have been met.</p>

<h3>22d08. Preschool teachers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
revised final regulations effective August 23, 2004, made no changes in the
Division’s interpretation of the law regarding the exempt status of bona fide
teachers in qualifying educational establishments.  The activity of imparting
knowledge through teaching, tutoring, instructing or lecturing implies a type
of work which is predominantly intellectual and which includes the exercise of
discretion and judgment in providing instruction to pupils.  See WHD Fact Sheet
17D.  Although preschools and day care centers (particularly at the earliest
ages of preparing children to enter school) may engage in some educational
activities, employees whose primary duty is to provide custodial care for the
basic physical needs of the children attending (as opposed to being engaged in
the intellectual activities of teaching, tutoring, instructing or lecturing in
order to impart knowledge) do not ordinarily meet the primary duty test for
exemption as teachers.  Conversely, bona fide teachers in preschool and
kindergarten settings may qualify for exemption under the same conditions as a
teacher in an elementary or secondary school, i.e., if they meet the primary
duty test for a teacher and are employed and engaged in this activity as a
teacher in a qualifying “educational establishment.”  Daycare centers providing
custodial care and protection of preschool age children before they are old
enough to enter the kindergarten or nursery school programs established for the
particular State’s elementary school curriculum do not qualify as “educational
establishments” for purposes of the teacher exemption.</p>

<h3>22d09.             Substitute teachers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
A substitute teacher may qualify for the professional
exemption if the duties test is met. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Certain
states do not require substitute teachers to have a college degree or teaching
certificate. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Instead,
a state, for example, may indicate that a person wishing to work as a
substitute teacher need only meet certain other requirements, such as obtaining
a substitute teaching permit, having completed a requisite number of college
semester hours, or having obtained an associate's degree from a regionally or
nationally accredited institution; or having obtained a high school diploma or
G.E.D. certificate, and completing 24 hours of in-service training and ten
hours of classroom observation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Substitute
teachers qualify for the professional exemption if their primary duty is
teaching and imparting knowledge in an educational establishment. On the other
hand, substitute teachers whose primary duties are not related to teaching—for
example, performing general clerical or administrative tasks for the school
unrelated to teaching their assigned students, or manual labor—do not qualify
for the professional exemption. The term &quot;educational establishment&quot;
includes &quot;an elementary or secondary school system, an institution of
higher education or other educational institution.&quot; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A
substitute teacher with a teaching certificate clearly qualifies for the professional
exemption. However, private schools and public schools are not uniform in
requiring a certificate for employment as an elementary or secondary school
teacher, and a teacher’s certificate is not generally necessary for employment
in institutions of higher education or other educational establishments.
Therefore, a teacher who is not certified may be considered for exemption,
provided that such individual is employed as a teacher by the employing school
or school system. Further, there is no minimum educational or academic degree
requirement for bona fide teaching professionals in educational institutions.
Employees working as substitute teachers are within the teaching professional
exemption whether or not they possess an advanced academic degree so long as
teaching is their primary duty. </p>

<h3>22d12. Flight instructors.</h3>

A flight instructor may qualify for exemption as a teacher
under 29 CFR § 541.303 if the instructor: (1) is certified in accordance with part
61 of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reg (14 CFR part 61) and (2) is
engaged and employed as an instructor by a flight school approved by the FAA
under FAA Reg 14 and CFR part 141.  A flight school which is approved under FAA
Reg part 141 would constitute an “educational establishment” for purposes of 29
CFR § 541.204(b).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Although there is no salary requirement for exemption as a
teacher, a flight instructor must meet the primary duty test of teaching,
tutoring, instructing or lecturing in the activity of imparting knowledge in
order to be exempt.  Exempt teaching activities would include, among other
things, all student flight instruction including related ground training such as
the maintenance of an airplane engine, instruction in FAA regulations,
navigation, meteorology, radio procedure, maintenance of student progress and
accomplishment records, scheduling of students and aircraft used for
instruction, as well as maintaining liaison with the FAA for current teaching
techniques and requirements.  Performing minor repairs on aircraft the
instructor uses in training would also be considered an exempt activity.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Public
Law 101-583 (Nov. 15, 1990), directed DOL to issue regulations permitting
computer systems analysts, computer programmers, software engineers, and other
similarly-skilled professional workers to qualify as exempt executive,
administrative, or professional employees under 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1); the law
also exempted employees in the named occupations if they were paid on an hourly
basis at a rate of at least 6 ½ times the minimum wage.  These statutory
provisions were incorporated into former 29 CFR §§ 541.3(a)(4) and 541.303, as
part of the “professional” employee exemption, in 1992.  When Congress
increased the minimum wage in 1996, Congress adopted most – but not all – of
the Department’s regulatory language constituting the computer employee
“primary duty test” as a separate statutory exemption in a new 29 U.S.C. §  213(a)(17). 
29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(17) exempts “any employee who is a computer systems analyst,
computer programmer, software engineer, or other similarly skilled worker,
whose primary duty …” meets one of three specified sets of duties, or a
combination of the specified duties requiring the same level of skills.  The
1996 amendment also froze the hourly compensation test at $27.63 (which equaled
6 ½ times the former $4.25 minimum wage).  The 1996 law included no delegation
of rulemaking authority to DOL to further interpret or define the scope of the
exemption; however, it also did not repeal the original 1990 statute. The 2004 part
541 final rule aligned the duties test in the regulatory text with the 1996
law. Thus the same duties test now applies for determining the exempt status of
computer-related occupations under either 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) or 29 U.S.C.
§ 213(a)(17), but an exempt computer employee may be paid either “on a salary
basis” at a rate not less than $455 per week, or on an hourly basis at a rate
not less than $27.63 per hour.</p>

<h3>22e01. Criteria for exemption of “computer” employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
To be exempt as a bona fide “computer” employee under 29 CFR
§ 541.400, all of the following tests must be met:<a name="6"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employee
must be compensated on a salary or fee basis at a rate of not less than $455/wk
($380/wk if employed in American Samoa by employers other than the Federal
government), exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities, or if paid on an
hourly basis, at a rate not less than $27.63/hour;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The employee
must be employed as a computer system analyst, computer programmer, software
engineer, or other similarly skilled worker in the computer field performing
the duties described below; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The employee’s
primary duty (defined in 29 CFR § 541.700) must consist of:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The application of systems analysis techniques and
procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or
system functional specifications.</p>

<h3>22f00.  Criteria for exemption of “outside sales” employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
To be exempt as a bona fide “outside sales” employee under 29
CFR § 541.500, all of the following tests must be met:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employee’s
primary duty must be making sales (as defined in 29 U.S.C. § 203(k)), or
obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities for
which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer, and </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The employee
must be customarily and regularly engaged away from the employer’s place or
places of business in performing his or her primary duty. </p>
<p><a name="7"></a> </p>
<p>(b)  
“Primary duty” is defined in 29 CFR § 541.700 as the
principal, main, major or most important duty that the employee performs. 
Determination of an employee’s primary duty must be based on all the facts in
each case with the major emphasis on the character of the employee’s job as a
whole.  In determining the primary duty of an outside sales employee, work
performed incidental to and in conjunction with the employee’s own outside
sales or solicitations, including incidental deliveries and collections, is
considered exempt outside sales work.  Other work that furthers the employee’s
own sales efforts is also considered exempt work, e.g., writing sales reports,
updating or revising the employee’s sales or display catalogue, planning
itineraries and attending sales conferences.  (29 CFR § 541.500(b))  For
further explanation of the term “primary duty” see the discussion under
“executive” at FOH 22b01.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The salary requirements of 29 CFR part 541 do not apply to
the outside sales employee exemption.</p>

<h3>22f01.  Making sales or obtaining orders.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
“Sales” include any sale, exchange, contract to sell,
consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.  It includes the
transfer of title to tangible property, and in certain cases, of tangible and
valuable evidences of intangible property.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.501(b) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
“Obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use
of facilities” extends the outside sales exemption to more than just sales of
commodities.  Obtaining orders “for the use of facilities” includes the selling
of time on radio or television, the solicitation of advertising for newspapers
and other periodicals, and the solicitation of freight for railroads and other
transportation agencies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.501(c)</p>

The word “services” extends the outside sales exemption to
employees who sell or take orders for a service, which may be performed for the
customer by someone other than the person taking the order.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.501(d)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
An employee whose primary duty is to repair or service
products (e.g. refrigerator repair) does not qualify as an exempt outside sales
employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>69
FR 22161</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
Soliciting business through a dealer or merchant to offer a
product or service to a customer is not a sale within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. §
203(k).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22f02.  Customarily and regularly away from employer’s place of
business.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
An exempt outside sales employee must be customarily and
regularly engaged away from the employer’s place or places of business. 
“Customarily and regularly” means greater than occasional but less than
constant; it includes work normally and recurrently done every workweek, but
does not include isolated or one-time tasks.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.701</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
“Away from the employer’s place of business” means the
outside sales employee makes sales at the customer’s place of business or, if
selling door-to-door, at the customer’s home.  Outside sales does not include
sales made by mail, telephone or the Internet unless such contact is used
merely as an adjunct to personal visits to the customer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.502 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Any fixed site, whether home or office, used by a
salesperson as a headquarters or for telephonic solicitation of sales is
considered one of the employer’s places of business, even though the employer
is not in any formal sense the owner or tenant of the property.  However,
displaying samples in hotel sample rooms during trips from city to city are not
considered as the employer’s places of business.  Similarly, displaying the
employer’s products at a trade show of short duration (i.e., one or two weeks),
if selling actually occurs (rather than just sales promotion), is not
considered as the employer’s place of business.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.502</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An
employee who does not qualify for the outside sales exemption may, if employed
by a qualifying retail or service establishment, be considered for exemption
from overtime under 29 U.S.C. § 207(i) if the employee’s regular rate of pay is
more than one-and-one-half times the minimum wage and more than half the
employee’s compensation for a “representative period” represents commissions on
goods or services.  See 29 CFR §§ 779.410 – 779.420; FOH 21h.</p>

<h3>22f03.  Promotion work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Promotion work may or may not be exempt outside sales work,
depending upon the circumstances under which it is performed.  Promotional work
that is actually performed incidental to and in conjunction with an employee’s
own outside sales or solicitations is exempt work.  Promotional work that is
not incidental to an employee’s own outside sales, or that is incidental to
sales made or to be made by someone else, is not exempt outside sales work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.503 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The arrangement of merchandise on shelves or the
replenishing of stock is not exempt outside sales work unless it is incidental
to and in conjunction with the employee’s own outside sales. </p>

CFR § 541.503(b) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22f04.  Drivers who sell.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Drivers who deliver products and also sell such products
may qualify as exempt outside sales employees only if the primary duty is
making sales.  In determining the primary duty of drivers who sell, work
performed incidental to and in conjunction with the employee’s own outside
sales or solicitations is considered exempt outside sales work.  This includes
loading, driving or delivering the products that the employee sells. A driver
whose primary duty is to deliver products or goods, rather than selling
products or goods, is not exempt.                 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHD
Opinion Letter FLSA 2006-33 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Several factors should be considered to determine if a
driver has a primary duty of making sales, including (but not limited to):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Comparison of
the driver’s duties with those of other employees engaged as drivers and as
salespersons,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Presence or
absence of customary or contractual arrangements concerning amounts of products
to be delivered,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Whether the
driver possesses or has a selling or solicitor’s license when required by law,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The employer’s
specifications as to the qualifications for the position when hiring,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Description of
the employee’s occupation in collective bargaining agreements,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Sales training
and attendance at sales conferences,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  Method of
payment, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)  Proportion of
earnings directly attributable to sales.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
See 29 CFR § 541.504(c) and (d) for examples of drivers who
would, and who would not, qualify as exempt outside sales employees.</p>

<h3>22f05.  Employees obtaining or soliciting mortgages for banks, finance
companies or other lenders.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An
employee of a finance company that is engaged primarily in servicing mortgages
and takes mortgages in its own name may be exempt as an outside sales employee
if the employee is customarily and regularly engaged away from the employer’s
place(s) of business in obtaining mortgages from individuals or brokers.  Such
soliciting is exempt work under 29 CFR § 541.500.  Work incidental to the
employee’s obtaining the mortgage, such as obtaining credit information from
the mortgagor before and after the sale, would qualify as exempt work if done
with respect to the employee’s own sales.  Telephone solicitation, obtaining
credit and other information with respect to sales made by others, and other
work not incidental to the employee’s own outside sales would not be exempt
work.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mortgage
loan officers may qualify for the outside sales exemption even though they may
perform some activities at their employer’s place of business, so long as the
inside sales activity is incidental to and in conjunction with qualifying
outside sales activity. Activities such as making phone calls, sending e-mails,
and meeting with clients in the office are considered exempt if performed
incidental to or in conjunction with the mortgage loan officer’s own outside
sales activities. See 29 CFR § 541.503. </p>

<h3>22f06.  Real estate sales.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR § 541.500 requires that an outside sales employee’s
primary duty must be making “sales” within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 203(k) or
in obtaining certain orders or contracts for the use of facilities. Real estate
sales employees will generally meet this test, since “sales” under 29 U.S.C.
§ 203(k) includes contracts to sell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
An exempt outside sales employee also must be customarily
and regularly engaged “away from the employer’s place or places of business” in
making such sales.  Real estate sales employees typically are required, as a
customary and regular part of their employment, to spend time as necessary at the
site of property to be sold and in visiting prospects at the latter’s homes and
offices as a part of their sales effort.  Most of them must leave whatever
place of business of the employer they use as headquarters in order to perform
these tasks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
A real estate sales employee stationed in a model home on a
tract from which parcels of real property are being sold with or without
improvements, leaving the model home for such purposes, customarily and
regularly, would meet the requirement of the definition, so far as making sales
“away from” the employer’s place of business is concerned.  This is true even
though all of the property shown to prospects by the sales employee is within
the tract on which the model home is located.  Further, not every home called a
“model home” would be a place of business of the employer.  One which is in the
nature of an “open house” to which a sales employee is assigned to meet
prospects who may buy that house or another similar one on the tract may more
properly be viewed as analogous to the hotel sample room of a traveling sales
employee referred to in 29 CFR § 541.502 than to an actual place of business of
the employer.  Moreover, time spent on return to the model home or other
headquarters to conclude a sales transaction or to continue the sales effort
with the prospect would be deemed part of the sales employee’s outside sales
activity.</p>

<p>WHD
Opinion Letter FLSA 2007-02</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Certain activities performed by real estate sales employees
in the employer’s place of business may be exempt work if the activities
performed are in conjunction with and in furtherance of their outside sales
work. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For
example, the employees may perform duties at their employer’s place of business
including:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Bringing a
multiple listing book up to date, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Calling
prospects with whom the sales employee has been dealing during outside sales
activities, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Dictating or
writing letters to such prospects, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Talking to such
prospects in the office about their particular transactions, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Calling a list
of prospective buyers or sellers of homes with whom the sales employee has had
no prior contact,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Preparing a
contract and other forms required for a sale negotiated during the sales
employee’s outside sales activity, and </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  Talking to a
“walk-in” prospect with whom the employee has had no prior contact and showing
photographs and discussing terms on specific houses, if such activity results
in subsequent outside sales activity with the prospect.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
<b>Timeshare resort salespeople.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees
whose primary duty is to promote and to sell timeshare interests in resorts
owned or operated by their employers do not qualify for the outside sales
exemption when they sell timeshares on site at the resorts because they are not
engaged in sales away from their employer’s place of business. Sales conducted
at an office away from the resort that is a place of business of their employer
would also not qualify as sales made away from the employer’s place of
business. These employees may meet the tests of the outside sales exemption if
they customarily and regularly make sales at a location that is not the
employer’s place of business.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
question with timeshare salespeople is whether they are customarily and
regularly engaged away from the employer’s place of business in performing
their primary duty of making sales.  A resort is generally maintained on a
permanent basis as a location of the employer and is staffed with the necessary
personnel for maintaining the resort facilities.  Although the employer
sells timeshare interests in some of the properties on the resort, the employer
also retains a continuing business interest in the remaining resort facilities,
and in maintaining both the resort and the timeshare units that have been
sold.  Under these facts, the entire resort must be considered the
employer’s place of business.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Timeshare
salespeople differ from real estate sales employees selling lots of land from a
model home on a subdivision, who customarily and regularly leave the model
home, because in the latter situation the employer does not maintain a
continuing interest in the subdivision lots once they are sold or in the other
facilities in the subdivision, and thus these areas are not part of the
employer’s place of business.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If
timeshare resort salespeople never leave the employer’s place of business,
namely, the resort, they do not qualify for the outside sales exemption.  </p>

<h3>22f07.  Outside solicitors of charitable donations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Persons
employed in a capacity to solicit contributions on behalf of various charitable
organizations are not performing work within the scope of the outside sales
exemption. Soliciting promises of future charitable donations or “selling the
concept” of donating to a charity does not constitute “sales” for purposes of
the outside sales exemption. Such solicitors do not obtain orders or contracts
for services or for use of the charity’s facilities for which a consideration
will be paid.  Furthermore, the exchange of a token gift for the promise
of a charitable donation does not constitute a “sale” or “selling” for purposes
of the outside sales exemption.</p>

<h3>22g00. Amount of salary required for standard exemption tests.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
To qualify as a bona fide exempt executive, administrative
or professional employee, the  employee must be compensated on a salary basis
at a rate of not less than $455/wk (or $380/wk, if employed in American Samoa
by employers other than the Federal government), exclusive of board, lodging or
other facilities. Administrative, professional and computer employees may also
be paid on a fee basis, as defined in 29 CFR § 541.605.  The minimum weekly
salary specified in each category of the 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) exemptions is
one of several tests applied to determine if the exemptions are applicable; it
is not a minimum wage requirement.  No employer is required to pay an employee
the salary specified in 29 CFR part 541 unless the employer is claiming an
exemption pursuant to 29 CFR part 541 and 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.600(a) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The $455 required weekly minimum salary may be translated
into equivalent amounts for periods longer than one week.  The requirement will
be met if the employee is compensated biweekly on a salary basis of $910,
semimonthly on a salary basis of $985.83, or monthly on a salary basis of
$1,971.66.  However, the shortest period of payment that will meet this
compensation requirement is one week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.600(b) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
For academic administrative employees, the compensation
requirement also may be met by compensation on a salary basis at a rate at
least equal to the entrance salary for teachers in the educational
establishment by which the employee is employed, as stated in 29 CFR § 541.204(a)(1).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.600(c) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
For computer-related occupations exempt under 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(17),
the compensation requirement also may be met by payment on an hourly basis at
not less than $27.63/hour, as stated in 29 CFR § 541.400(b).          </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.600(d) </p>
<p> </p>

For professional employees, the compensation requirements
do not apply to employees engaged as teachers, see 29 CFR § 541.303; employees
who hold a valid license or certificate permitting the practice of law or
medicine or any of their branches and are actually engaged in the practice
thereof, see 29 CFR § 541.304; or to employees who hold the requisite academic
degree for the general practice of medicine and are engaged in an internship or
resident program pursuant to the practice of the profession. See 29 CFR §
541.304.  The exception from the salary or fee requirement for medical
occupations does not extend to pharmacists, nurses, therapists, technologists,
sanitarians, dieticians, social workers, psychologists, psychometrists, physicians
assistants, nurse practitioners or other professions which service the medical
profession.</p>

<h3>22g01. Highly compensated
employees test.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Under 29 CFR § 541.601, an employee who receives total
annual compensation of at least $100,000 is considered exempt if the employee
“customarily and regularly” performs any one or more of the exempt duties or
responsibilities of an executive, administrative or professional employee
identified in 29 CFR part 541 subparts B, C or D.  “Customarily and regularly”
means greater than occasional but may be less than constant, and includes work
normally and recurrently performed every workweek but does not include isolated
or one-time tasks.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR §§ 541.601, 541.707 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
 </p>
<p>(1)  “Total annual
compensation” must include at least $455/wk paid on a salary or fee basis. See 29
CFR §§ 541.602, 541.605.  Thus, highly compensated employees must receive at
least the same base salary throughout the year as required for exempt employees
under the standard exemption tests, while allowing highly compensated employees
to receive additional income in the form of commissions and nondiscretionary
bonuses.  Total annual compensation may include commissions, nondiscretionary
bonuses and other nondiscretionary compensation earned during a 52-week
period.  Total annual compensation does not include board, lodging and other
facilities as defined in 29 CFR § 541.606, and does not include payments for
medical insurance, payments for life insurance, contributions to retirement
plans and the cost of other fringe benefits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR § 541.
601(b)(1) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Whether bonuses
or other forms of compensation are discretionary or nondiscretionary is
determined by applying the principles in the Act and regulations defining
discretionary bonuses in 29 U.S.C. § 207(e)(3)(a) and 29 CFR § 778.211.  (Under
these principles, discretionary bonuses are excluded from an employee’s regular
rate of pay; nondiscretionary bonuses must be included in the regular rate. 
Similarly, under the highly compensated employee test, all nondiscretionary
bonuses and any other form of nondiscretionary compensation earned during the
year are counted, together with the employee’s salary, towards the $100,000
threshold.)  If the employer retains the discretion as to both the fact that a
payment will be made and the amount of the payment until at or near the point
in time that the payment is to be made, the payment is discretionary;
otherwise, it is nondiscretionary.  If an employer promises in advance to pay a
bonus, it is nondiscretionary.  If, under the terms of an employment agreement,
an employee has a contract right, express or implied, to receive a particular
type of payment, it is nondiscretionary.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following types
of payments are considered nondiscretionary: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Payments made pursuant to any prior contract, agreement, or
promise causing the employee to expect such payments regularly (e.g.,
commissions or bonuses paid monthly or quarterly based on the amount of sales
or profits),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Bonuses that are promised to employees upon hiring,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Bonuses that result from collective bargaining,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Bonuses that are announced ahead of time to induce
employees to complete assignments more quickly, more efficiently, or more
cost-effectively; (such as attendance bonuses, individual or group production
bonuses, or bonuses for quality and accuracy of work),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
Bonuses that are made contingent upon the employee
remaining employed with the employer until the time the payment is to be made.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All forms of
nondiscretionary compensation are included when determining if a highly
compensated employee has received not less than $100,000 in total annual
compensation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  If an
employee’s total annual compensation does not total at least $100,000 by the
final pay period of the 52-week period, the employer may, during the last pay
period or within one month after the end of the 52-week period, make one final payment
sufficient to achieve the $100,000 compensation level.  Any such final payment
made after the end of the 52-week period may count only toward the prior year’s
total annual compensation and not toward the total annual compensation in the
year it was paid.  If the employer fails to make such a payment, the employee
does not qualify as a highly compensated employee, but may be tested for
exemption under the standard exemption tests in 29 CFR part 541 subparts B, C
or D.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR §
541.601(b)(2) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  An employee who
does not work a full year for the employer, either because the employee is
newly hired after the beginning of the year or ends the employment before the
end of the year, may qualify for exemption as a highly compensated employee if
the employee receives a pro rata portion of the minimum $100,000 annual amount,
based upon the number of weeks that the employee will be or has been employed. 
An employer may make one final payment as under 22g01(b)(3) within one month
after the end of the employee’s employment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR §
541.601(b)(3) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  The employer
may utilize any 52-week period as the compensation year, such as a calendar
year, a fiscal year, or an anniversary of hire year.  If the employer does not
identify some other year period in advance, the calendar year will be applied.</p>

<p>(c)  
A high level of compensation is a strong indicator of a
“white collar” employee’s exempt status, thus eliminating the need for a
detailed analysis of the employee’s particular job duties.  A highly
compensated employee will qualify for exemption if the employee customarily and
regularly performs any one or more of the exempt duties or responsibilities of
an executive, administrative or professional employee identified in 29 CFR part
541 subparts B, C or D.  For example, an employee may qualify as a highly compensated
executive employee if the employee customarily and regularly directs the work
of two or more other employees, even though the employee does not meet all of
the other requirements for the executive exemption under 29 CFR § 541.100.  </p>

The highly compensated employee exemption applies only to
employees whose primary duty includes performing office or non-manual work. 
Thus, for example, non-management production-line workers and non-management
employees in maintenance, construction and similar occupations such as
carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen,
operating engineers, longshoremen, construction workers, laborers and other
employees who perform work involving repetitive operations with their hands,
physical skill and energy cannot qualify for exemption under this test no

<h3>22g02. “Salary basis” rule.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
To qualify for exemption under 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1), employees
generally must be paid not less than $455/wk “on a salary basis.”  However,
these salary requirements do not apply to outside sales employees (29 CFR
§ 541.500(c)), teachers (29 CFR § 541.303(d)), or employees practicing law
or medicine (29 CFR § 541.304).  Exempt computer employees may be paid either
on a salary or fee basis at not less than $455/wk or on an hourly basis at not
less than $27.63/hour (29 CFR § 541.400(b)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Being paid “on a salary basis” means that the employee
regularly receives a predetermined amount of compensation each pay period on a
weekly, or less frequent, basis and the predetermined amount cannot be subject
to reduction because of variations in either the quality or the quantity of
work performed by the employee.  Except for seven exceptions specifically cited
in the regulations (29 CFR § 541.602(b)(1) through (7)), an exempt employee
must receive the full salary for any week in which the employee performs any
work, regardless of the number of days or hours worked.  If the employer makes
deductions from the employee’s predetermined salary because of the operating
requirements of the business or absences caused by the employer, the employee
is not paid “on a salary basis.”  If an exempt employee is ready, willing and
able to work, deductions may not be made for time when work is not available. 
However, exempt employees need not be paid for any workweek in which they
perform no work.</p>

make deductions from the salaries of exempt employees in the following
circumstances:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  When the
employee is absent from work for one or more full days for personal reasons,
other than sickness or disability – if an exempt employee is absent for one and
a half days for personal reasons, the employer may deduct only for the one
full-day absence; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR §
541.602(b)(1)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  When the
employee is absent from work for one or more full days due to sickness or
disability (including work-related accidents) if the deduction is made
according to a bona fide plan, policy or practice of providing compensation for
loss of salary for these types of absences, including under a State disability
insurance law or State workers’ compensation law (the employer is not required
to pay any portion of the employee’s salary for full-day absences for which the
employee receives compensation under the plan, policy, or practice, or for full-day
absences before the employee has qualified under the plan, policy or practice
and after the employee has exhausted the leave allowance thereunder);</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR §
541.602(b)(2) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  While an
employer cannot make deductions from an exempt employee’s salary for absences
caused by jury duty, attendance as a witness or temporary military leave, the
employer may offset any amounts received by an employee as jury fees, witness
fees or military pay for a particular week against the salary due for that
particular week; </p>

<p>Certain
deductions permitted under the regulations may be taken only for “one or more full

only in full-day increments.  Deductions for partial-day absences violate the
salary basis rule generally, except those occurring in the first or final
weeks of employment (29 CFR § 541.602(b)(6)) or for unpaid leave taken
under the Family and Medical Leave Act (29 CFR §541.602(b)(7)).  Thus, for
example, if an employee is absent for one and a half days to handle personal
affairs, the employer may only deduct for the one full-day absence.  The
employee must receive a full day’s pay for the partial day worked to satisfy
the “salary basis” rule.  A deduction from pay as a penalty for violations of
major safety rules under 29 CFR § 541.602(b)(4) may be made in any amount.</p>

employee’s accrued leave accounts (regardless of whether to cover partial-day

record their hours worked; requiring exempt employees to work a specified
schedule of hours; and implementing bona fide, across-the-board changes in

<p> </p>
<p>Where an employer
has adopted a vacation leave and sick leave policy or plan, or a plan providing
employees leave to attend children’s school activities, or to transport family
members to routine medical appointments, it is permissible for the employer to
substitute or reduce the accrued leave in the plan for the time that an exempt
salaried employee is absent from work even if it is less than a full day
without affecting the salary basis of payment, if by substituting or reducing
such “leave bank” the employee continues to receive payment of an amount equal
to the employee’s guaranteed salary.  However, if an exempt employee is absent
for less than a full day, the employee must still receive payment of the full
guaranteed salary even if the employee has no accrued benefits in the “leave
bank” or if the employee’s account has a negative balance.  According to
§ 541.602(b)(1), the employer may deduct from the salary of an exempt
employee for being absent a full day for personal reasons. The employee’s
exempt status, however, would not be affected if the employer chooses to pay a
portion of the daily equivalent salary when the employee has insufficient leave
available to cover the full-day absence (e.g., an employer applies the last
remaining four hours of leave in an employee’s “leave bank” which only
partially covers the full-day, eight-hour absence).</p>

<h3>22g03. Effect of improper deductions from salary.</h3>
<p>                                              </p>
<p>(a)  
An employer will lose the exemption if the facts
demonstrate that the employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary
basis.  An “actual practice” of making improper deductions demonstrates that
the employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary basis.  The factors to
consider when determining whether an employer has an actual practice of making
improper deductions include, but are not limited to, the number of improper
deductions, particularly as compared to the number of employee infractions
warranting discipline; the time period during which the employer made improper
deductions; the number and geographic location of employees whose salary was
improperly reduced; the number and geographic location of managers responsible
for taking the improper deductions; and whether the employer has a clearly
communicated policy permitting or prohibiting improper deductions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.603(a) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
If the facts demonstrate that the employer has an actual
practice of making improper deductions, the exemption is lost during the time
period in which the improper deductions were made for employees in the same job
classification working for the same managers responsible for the actual
improper deductions.  Employees in different job classifications or who work
for different managers do not lose their exempt status.  For example, if a
manager at a company facility routinely docks the pay of engineers at that
facility for partial-day personal absences, then all engineers at that facility
whose pay could have been improperly docked by that manager would lose the
exemption; engineers at other facilities or working for other managers,
however, would remain exempt.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.603(b) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Isolated or inadvertent improper deductions will not result
in loss of the exemption for any employees if the employer reimburses the
employees for the improper deductions.  Whether deductions are “isolated” is
determined according to an analysis of the factors in 29 CFR § 541.603(a). 
“Inadvertent” deductions are those taken unintentionally, for example, as a
result of a clerical or time-keeping error.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.603(c) </p>
<p>69
FR 22181</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Safe harbor.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  29 CFR § 541.603(d)
provides a safe harbor for employers that have a clearly communicated policy
prohibiting improper deductions.  If an employer has such a clearly
communicated policy that prohibits the improper pay deductions specified in 29 CFR
§ 541.602(a), includes a mechanism for employees to file complaints, reimburses
employees for any improper deductions and makes a good faith commitment to
comply with the salary basis rule in the future, the employer will not lose the
exemption for any employees unless the employer willfully violates the policy
by continuing to make improper deductions after receiving employee complaints. 
Failure to reimburse employees for any improper deductions or continuing to
make improper deductions after receiving employee complaints will cause the
exemption to be lost during the time period in which the improper deductions
were made for employees in the same job classification working for the same
managers responsible for the actual improper deductions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Although a
written policy is the best evidence of the employer’s good faith efforts to
comply with the salary basis rule under 29 CFR part 541, a written policy is
not essential.  However, the policy must have been “clearly communicated” to
employees prior to the actual impermissible deduction.  The “clearly
communicated” standard can be met, for example, by providing a copy of the
policy to employees when they are hired, publishing it in an employee handbook
or distributing it to employees over the employer’s Intranet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The safe harbor
provision is available regardless of the reason for the improper deduction,
whether made for lack of work or for reasons other than lack of work.  For
example, where an employer has a clearly communicated policy prohibiting
improper deductions but a manager engages in an actual practice (neither
isolated nor inadvertent) of making improper deductions, regardless of the
reasons for the deductions, the exemption would not be lost for any employees
if, after receiving and investigating an employee complaint, the employer
reimburses the employees for the improper deductions and makes a good faith
commitment to comply in the future.  There are several ways in which an
employer could show its “good faith commitment” to comply in the future
including (but not limited to) adopting or re-publishing to employees its
policy prohibiting improper pay deductions; posting a notice including such a
commitment on an employee bulletin board or the employer’s Intranet; providing
training to managers and supervisors on the employer’s policy and commitment;
reprimanding or training the manager who took the improper deduction(s); or
establishing a telephone number for employees to file complaints concerning
improper deductions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>69 FR 22181 through 22182</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  An employer
should be allowed a reasonable amount of time to look into and correct a matter
after receiving an employee complaint of improper deductions.  While the amount
of time it will take an employer to complete an investigation will depend upon
the particular circumstances, an employer should begin such an investigation
promptly.  However, the mere fact that the employer receives other employee complaints
before timely completion of the investigation should not, by itself, defeat the
safe harbor. </p>

<h3>22g04. Employer employs both exempt and nonexempt employees in the same
capacity.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Having
some employees within the same job classification, who perform the same duties,
but are paid on a different (hourly) basis, does not affect the status of any
other exempt employees who are paid on a salary basis. An employer may,
therefore, employ both hourly and salaried registered nurses, for example, and
the salaried registered nurses will not lose their exempt status, assuming they
otherwise qualify for the exemption.</p>

<h3>22g05. Minimum guarantee plus extras.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
(An exempt employee may receive additional compensation
beyond the minimum required amount that is paid as a guaranteed salary without
violating the salary basis requirement.  29 CFR § 541.604(a).  Thus, for
example, an exempt employee guaranteed at least $455 each week paid on a salary
basis may also receive additional compensation of a one percent commission on
sales.  An exempt employee also may receive a percentage of the sales or profits
if the employment arrangement also includes a guarantee of at least $455 each
week paid on a salary basis.  Similarly, the exemption is not lost if an exempt
employee who is guaranteed at least $455 each week paid on a salary basis also
receives additional compensation based on hours worked for work beyond the
normal workweek.  Such additional compensation may be paid on any basis (e.g.,
flat sum, bonus payment, straight-time hourly amount, time and one-half or any
other basis), and may include paid time off.</p>

Opinion Letter FLSA 2006-43 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The prohibition against improper deductions from the
guaranteed salary under 29 CFR § 541.602(b) does not extend to any such
additional compensation provided to exempt employees. Therefore, deductions for
cash shortages, for example, may be made from a salaried exempt employee’s
commission payments without affecting the employee’s exempt status under
section 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1), so long as the commission payments are bona fide
and are not paid to facilitate otherwise prohibited deductions from the
guaranteed salary. </p>

<h3>22g06. Computation of salary on an hourly, daily or shift basis.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An
exempt employee’s earnings may be computed on an hourly, daily, or shift basis,
without losing the exemption or violating the salary basis requirement, if the
employment arrangement also includes a guarantee of at least the minimum weekly
required amount paid on a salary basis regardless of the number of hours, days,
or shifts worked; and a reasonable relationship exists between the guaranteed
amount and the amount actually earned.  The reasonable relationship test will
be met if the weekly guarantee is roughly equivalent to the employee’s usual
earnings at the assigned hourly, daily, or shift rate for the employee’s normal
scheduled workweek, as the case may be.  Thus, for example, an exempt employee
guaranteed compensation of at least $500 for any week in which the employee
performs any work, and who normally works four or five shifts each week, may be
paid $150 per shift without violating the salary basis requirement (such an
employee must receive the full $500 guarantee in any week in which he or she
works three or fewer shifts). The reasonable relationship requirement applies
only to situations where the employee’s pay is computed on an hourly, daily or
shift basis.  It does not apply, for example, to an exempt store manager paid a
guaranteed salary of $650 per week who also receives a commission of one-half
percent of all sales in the store or five percent of the store’s profits, which
in some weeks may total as much as, or even more than, the guaranteed salary. 
The actual facts under the employment arrangement must be scrutinized in each
instance to determine the predetermined amount that was actually guaranteed to
be paid “on a salary basis.”</p>

CFR § 541.604(b) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22g07. Computation of salary including bonuses and commissions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>To
qualify as a guaranteed salary, payment of a fixed, predetermined amount “free
and clear” (at a rate not less than $455 per week) is required for each
workweek in which an exempt employee performs any work. Bonuses and commissions
do not generally qualify as fixed, predetermined amounts that are paid “free
and clear” because they are normally subject to variations based on the quality
or quantity of the work performed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.602</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22g08. Fee basis.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Administrative, professional, and computer employees may be
paid on a fee basis, rather than on a salary basis.  An employee is considered
paid on a “fee basis” under 29 CFR § 541.605 if the employee is paid an agreed
sum for completing a single job, regardless of the time required to complete
the work.  These payments resemble piecework payments with the important
distinction that generally a “fee” is paid for the kind of jobs that are unique
rather than for a series of jobs repeated an indefinite number of times, and
for which payment on an identical basis is made over and over again.  Payments
based on the number of hours or days worked and not on the accomplishment of a
single task are not payments on a fee basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.605(a) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
To test whether a fee payment meets the minimum level
required for exemption, consider the time worked to complete the job and
determine if the payment is at a rate that would yield at least $455 per week
if the employee worked 40 hours.  For example, an artist paid $250 for a
picture that took 20 hours to complete meets the minimum $455 requirement for
exemption since earnings at this rate would yield the artist $500 if 40 hours
were worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.605(b) </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>(c)  
</b><b>Piece rate and percentages of hourly rates charged
do not constitute a “fee basis.” </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A
“fee basis” is an agreed sum for a single job without regard to the time
required for its completion. Payments based on an amount per transaction or per
line are more properly viewed as “piece rate” payments. A payment based upon a
percentage of hourly amounts billed or charged to a client is, likewise, not a
payment on a “fee basis.” </p>

<h3>22g09. Board, lodging or other facilities.</h3>
<p>                                    </p>
<p>(a)  
To qualify for exemption under 29 CFR part 541, an employee
must earn the minimum required salary amount “exclusive of board, lodging or
other facilities.”  This phrase means payment of the required salary amount
must be “free and clear” or independent of any claimed credit for non-cash
items of value that an employer may provide to an employee.  Thus, the costs
incurred by an employer to provide an employee with board, lodging or other
facilities may not count towards the minimum salary amount required for
exemption.  Such separate transactions are not prohibited between employers and
their exempt employees, but the costs to employers associated with such
transactions may not be considered when determining if an employee has received
the full required minimum salary payment. See 29 CFR § 541.606. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHD
FLSA Opinion Letter March 7, 1969 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
29 CFR part 531 defines what constitutes “board, lodging,
or other facilities.”  As described in 29 CFR § 531.32, the term “other
facilities” refers to items similar to board and lodging, such as meals
furnished at company restaurants or cafeterias or by hospitals, hotels, or
restaurants to their employees; meals, dormitory rooms, and tuition furnished
by a college to its student employees; merchandise furnished at company stores
or commissaries, including articles of food, clothing, and household effects;
housing furnished for dwelling purposes; and transportation furnished to
employees for ordinary commuting between their homes and work.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22g10. Annual salary earned in a shorter period.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
exemption is not lost in the situation where an annual salary covering a duty
period of less than a year, when prorated over the full 12 months, computes to
an amount less than the required minimum, provided that the amount of salary
when prorated over the actual duty period meets the required minimum amount
(e.g., employment provided by schools for ten months of the year, under which
the annual salary is paid in 12 equal monthly installments throughout the
year).</p>

<h3>22g11. Salary reduction as a result of reduced workweek.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A prospective
reduction in the predetermined salary amount to not less than the applicable
minimum salary due to a reduction in the employee’s normal scheduled workweek
is permissible and will not defeat the exemption, provided that the reduction
in salary is a bona fide reduction that is not designed to circumvent the
salary basis requirement (e.g., a 20 percent reduction in an exempt employee’s
salary while assigned to work a normally scheduled four-day reduced workweek
due to the financial exigencies of the employer and/or to avoid layoffs would
not violate the regulations as long as the reduced predetermined salary amount is
at a rate that is not less than the applicable minimum salary of $455 per
week). But see also FOH 22g20. For employees of public agencies, see 29 CFR §
541.710 and FOH 22h05(b).</p>

<h3>22g13. Deductions from salary or from leave/paid time off (PTO) banks.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Employers are free to require use of leave, thus reducing
time available in a leave bank, at any time. Since leave time is not required
by the FLSA, there is no prohibition against an employer giving vacation time
and later requiring that such vacation time be taken on a specific day. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHD
Letter FLSA 2005-41NA  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Section 541.602(b)(1) states that “deductions from pay may
be made when an exempt employee is absent from work for one or more full days
for personal reasons.”  Salary deductions, therefore, may be made when
exempt employees voluntarily take time off for personal reasons, other than
sickness or disability, for one or more full days.  For instance, an
exempt employee paid $500 per week on a salary basis may take voluntary time
off for personal reasons for four days in a workweek and receive one fifth of
the salary.  The employee’s decision to take voluntary time off, however,
must be completely voluntary and not “occasioned by the employer or by the
operating requirements of the business.”</p>

An employer may require use of leave for periods of
inclement weather, either in whole or partial day increments. If the firm is
open for operations, the employer may make deductions from salary for one or more
whole days of absence if the employee chooses to not report to work. A
deduction for an employee’s choice to not report to work during a period of
adverse weather is a deduction for personal reasons, other than sickness or
disability. If the firm is not open for operations, the employer must pay the
full amount of the salary due for any week in which the employee performs any
work. Neither an employee’s status as a probationary employee, nor the fact
that an employee may have a zero or negative accrued leave balance, provides an
excuse for the employer to pay less than the full amount of salary required to
maintain the employee’s salary basis status if the firm is not open for
operations.</p>

An employer may require exempt employees to use accrued
vacation time during a plant shutdown of less than a workweek without violating
the salary basis test. Likewise, an employer may require employees to use paid
time off to accommodate staffing levels needed during a period of reduced
workload.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since
employers are not required under the FLSA to provide any vacation time to
employees, there is no prohibition against an employer giving vacation time and
later requiring that such vacation time be taken on a specific day(s). 
Therefore, an employer may direct exempt staff to take vacation or debit their
leave bank account, whether for a full or partial day’s absence, provided the
employees receive in payment an amount equal to their guaranteed
salary.  </p>

<p>(e)  
Mandatory unpaid time off, when required for increments of
less than a full work week, in order to accommodate day-to-day or week-to-week
fluctuations of business will violate the requirement to pay on a salary basis.
This differs from a situation where a salary is reduced prospectively to
reflect a bona fide reduction in normal scheduled hours. (See FOH 22g10.)</p>

<h3>22g14. Deductions from salary when paid time off (PTO) bank is exhausted.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Deductions
may be made from an exempt employee’s paid time off (PTO) bank for both full
and partial day absences, without affecting the employee’s exempt status. In
such instances, the full salary is paid to the employee. If the PTO bank may be
used for absences related to sickness or disability, when an employee’s PTO
bank is exhausted, an employer may make deductions for one or more full days of
absence without affecting the payment on a salary basis. Such deductions are
made in “accordance with a bona fide plan, policy or practice of providing
compensation for loss of salary occasioned by such sickness or disability.”</p>

<h3>22g15. Deduction of extra compensation for reduction in extended
workweek schedule.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An
extended workweek schedule is a definite schedule of hours longer than the
regular workweek for a temporary period (e.g., a month or more).  For example,
an employee who is normally scheduled to work an eight-hour day, five-day
workweek may be scheduled to work five days of nine hours or six eight-hour
days.  (A change in the workweek that is intended to be (or in fact is)
permanent is not an extended workweek schedule as discussed herein.) </p>
<p>Because
the payment of extra compensation to a bona fide exempt employee for working an
extended schedule is an addition to, rather than a part of, the employee’s
predetermined salary, deductions of all or part of the extra compensation when
the employee fails to work the full extended workweek schedule will not be regarded
as a deduction from the employee’s predetermined salary. This assumes that the
extra compensation is bona fide and is not paid to facilitate otherwise
prohibited deductions from the guaranteed salary.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22g16. Deductions for disability insurance benefit payments.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
When an insurance plan is bona fide, compliance with its
terms is compliance with the salary basis of payment required under 29 CFR part
541 even though a waiting period in excess of one or more days is required
before the employee becomes eligible for inclusion in the insurance plan, or
there is a waiting period for each illness before benefits are paid. See 29 CFR
§ 541.602(b)(2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The fact that the employee receives no pay for some period
during an illness, or that the employee’s disability leave pay is less than the
employee’s predetermined salary will not defeat the salary basis requirement,
so long as the plan is a bona fide insurance plan.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22g17.                         Reduced salary during periods of partial
disability.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A
disability pay plan which provides for a fixed reduced salary during the period
of an employee’s partial disability or rehabilitation will not cause loss of the
salary basis status, so long as the salary paid at least meets the minimum
required by 29 CFR part 541.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An
employer may choose to convert an employee to a nonexempt status during a
period when the employee is unable to perform his regular exempt duties,
without affecting the exempt status of other similarly situated employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A
partial disability or rehabilitation payment plan that provides for
compensation that fluctuates based on the number of hours worked by the
employee will not qualify as a salary. </p>

<h3>22g20. Deductions due to
suspensions for infractions of workplace conduct rules.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>“Workplace
conduct rules” refers to conduct, and not to performance and attendance,
issues. Moreover, it refers to serious workplace misconduct, like sexual
harassment, violence, drug or alcohol violations, or violations of state or
federal laws. However, the fact that the misconduct occurred off the employer’s
premises does not preclude an employer from imposing such a disciplinary
suspension, as long as the employer has bona fide workplace conduct rules that
cover such off-site conduct. This disciplinary exception, however, does not
allow deductions for fines, settlements or judgments which could arguably be
blamed on an exempt employee.</p>

week as a result of a suspension (for reasons other than violating workplace
conduct rules) or the employer’s direction to work fewer hours due to a lack of

<h3>22g26. Foreign national paid in foreign currency.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employers
may pay foreign nationals temporarily residing in the U.S. all or a portion of
their salary in foreign currency. To determine whether the minimum salary
requirements of 29 CFR § 541.600(a) are met, the portion of the salary paid in
foreign currency must be calculated using the exchange rate in effect at the
time the wages are paid to the employee. The employer is not relieved from the
obligation to meet all of the requirements under section 29 CFR § 541.600 for
each pay period for which the exemption is claimed. The tests found in 29 CFR §
541.602 must also be met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
total compensation package will meet the salary level requirements in those pay
periods in which the $455 per week equivalent threshold is met when the dollar
compensation is combined with the foreign currency compensation that is
converted using the exchange rate current at the time of payment (i.e., the
rate generally available to an individual person in the vicinity where the
employee is working). In any pay period during which the total of the dollar
compensation and dollar value of the foreign currency is less than $455 per
week, the exemption will not apply.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The
number of hours worked by an employee who is exempt under 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1)
is a matter to be determined between the employer and the employee.  An
employer may require an exempt employee to make up work time lost due to
personal absences of less than a day (but not dock the salary) without loss of
the exemption under 29 U.S.C.§ 213(a)(1). However, the failure to
make up the time as required or to work the required number of hours does not
constitute a violation of a “workplace conduct rule” for which an employer may
impose a disciplinary suspension for one or more full days pursuant to 29 CFR §
541.602(b)(5). Such rules must be applicable to all employees and must relate
to workplace conduct, not performance or attendance, issues.  </p>

<h3>22h00. Use of manuals.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
use of manuals, guidelines or other established procedures containing or
relating to highly technical, scientific, legal, financial or other similarly
complex matters that can be understood or interpreted only by those with
advanced or specialized knowledge or skills does not disqualify an employee
from exemption under 29 CFR part 541.  Such manuals and procedures provide
guidance in addressing difficult or novel circumstances and thus use of such
reference material would not affect an employee’s exempt status.  The 29 CFR part
541 exemptions are not available, however, for employees who simply apply
well-established techniques or procedures described in manuals or other sources
within closely prescribed limits to determine the correct response to an
inquiry or set of circumstances. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.704 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use
of a software program that enhances an exempt employee’s ability to evaluate
products, options and variables to serve the customer does not necessarily
disqualify an employee from the exemption.    </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22h01. Emergencies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
An exempt employee does not lose exempt status by
performing work of a normally nonexempt nature because of an emergency.  When
emergencies occur that threaten the safety of employees, a cessation of
operations or serious damage to the employer’s property, any work performed in
an effort to prevent such results is considered exempt work.  Emergencies
arising out of an employer’s business and affecting the public health or
welfare may qualify under this provision, applying the same standard as
emergencies that affect the safety of employees or customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
“Emergency” does not include events that are not beyond
control or for which the employer can reasonably provide in the normal course
of business.  Emergencies generally occur only rarely, and are events that the
employer cannot reasonably anticipate. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The following examples from 29 CFR § 541.706(c) illustrate
the distinction between emergency work considered exempt work and routine work
that is not exempt work:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  A mine
superintendent who pitches in after an explosion and digs out workers who are
trapped in the mine is still a bona fide executive.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Assisting nonexempt
employees with their work during periods of heavy workload or to handle rush
orders is not exempt work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Replacing a nonexempt
employee during the first day or partial day of an illness may be considered
exempt emergency work depending on factors such as the size of the
establishment and of the executive’s department, the nature of the industry,
the consequences that would flow from the failure to replace the ailing
employee immediately, and the feasibility of filling the employee’s place
promptly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Regular repair
and cleaning of equipment is not emergency work, even when necessary to prevent
fire or explosion; however, repairing equipment may be emergency work if the breakdown
of, or damage to, the equipment was caused by accident or carelessness that the
employer could not reasonably anticipate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
The foregoing list of situations where exempt employees
could perform nonexempt work without losing their exempt status is not meant to
be exhaustive.  Other similar instances where exempt employees perform nonexempt
work under unanticipated circumstances should be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis.  However, it continues to be DOL’s position that nonexempt work may not
routinely be assigned to an exempt employee solely for the convenience of the
employer without calling into question the applicability of the exemption to
that employee.</p>

<h3>22h02. Occasional tasks.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Occasional,
infrequently recurring tasks that cannot practicably be performed by nonexempt
employees, but are the means for an exempt employee to properly carry out
exempt functions and responsibilities, are considered exempt work.  The
following factors should be considered in determining whether such work is
exempt work:  whether the same work is performed by any of the exempt
employee’s subordinates; practicability of delegating the work to a nonexempt
employee; whether the exempt employee performs the task frequently or
occasionally; and existence of an industry practice for the exempt employee to
perform the task.  </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>22h03. Combination exemptions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.708 allows for “tacking” or combining exempt work under one category
of the exemptions to exempt work under another category when determining if an
employee’s primary duty is to perform exempt work.  Thus, employees who perform
a combination of exempt duties for the executive, administrative, professional,
outside sales or computer exemptions may still qualify for exemption.  For
example, an employee whose primary duty involves a combination of exempt
administrative and exempt executive work may qualify for exemption.  In other
words, work that is exempt under one section of 29 CFR part 541 will not defeat
the applicability of the exemption under any other section. Employees who meet
the primary duty test as a result of “tacking” or combining exempt work must
also meet the other requirements of the exemption.</p>

<h3>22h04. Motion picture producing industry.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The “salary basis” requirement (29 CFR § 541.602) does not
apply to an employee in the motion picture producing industry who is
compensated at a base rate of at least $695 a week (exclusive of board,
lodging, or other facilities).  An employee in this industry who is otherwise
exempt under 29 CFR part 541 subparts B, C or D, and who is employed at a base
rate of at least $695 a week, is exempt if paid a proportionate amount (based
on a week of not more than 6 days) for any week in which the employee does not
work a full workweek for any reason. Moreover, an otherwise exempt employee in
this industry qualifies for exemption if the employee is employed at a daily
rate under the following circumstances: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employee is
in a job category for which a weekly base rate is not provided and the daily
base rate would yield at least $695 if 6 days were worked; or </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The employee is
in a job category having a weekly base rate of at least $695 and the daily base
rate is at least one-sixth of such weekly base rate. See 29 CFR § 541.709.</p>

<h3>22h05. Employees of public agencies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Under 29 CFR § 541.710, an employee of a public agency who
otherwise meets the salary basis requirements of 29 CFR § 541.602 will not be
disqualified from exemption under 29 CFR §§ 541.100, 541.200, 541.300 or
541.400 on the basis that the employee is paid according to a pay system
established by statute, ordinance or regulation, or by a policy or practice
established pursuant to principles of public accountability, under which the
employee accrues personal leave and sick leave and which requires the public
agency employee’s pay to be reduced or such employee to be placed on leave
without pay for absences for personal reasons or because of illness or injury
of less than one work-day when accrued leave is not used by an employee
because:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Permission for
its use has not been sought or has been sought and denied,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Accrued leave
has been exhausted, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The employee
chooses to use leave without pay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Deductions from the pay of an employee of a public agency
for absences due to a budget-required furlough shall not disqualify the
employee from being paid on a salary basis except in the workweek in which the
furlough occurs and for which the employee’s pay is accordingly reduced.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
This special exception to the salary basis requirement for
employees of public agencies formerly appeared as 29 CFR § 541.5d.  The reasons

<h3>22i00.  General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR part 541 provides examples of particular occupations to demonstrate how to
apply the regulatory concepts defining the exemptions in those situations. Some
of the examples were also presented in the prior regulations. Note that while
the examples may be useful in understanding how to apply the regulations to
specific occupations, in order for an exemption to apply in a particular case,
it is still necessary to confirm that an employee actually performs exempt
duties and meets all other tests for the particular exemption claimed under 29 CFR
part 541. Likewise, the examples cited below, when taken from opinion letters
issued by the Wage and Hour Administrator, respond to a fact-specific inquiry. Certain
examples below include only summaries taken from opinion letters. The opinion
letter cited should be reviewed for a fuller discussion. A slight difference in
the facts may result in a different outcome. Also, while the examples may
provide useful guidance regarding the application of 29 CFR part 541 for a
particular occupation, it must be remembered that a job title alone is
insufficient to establish the exempt status of an employee. The exempt or
nonexempt status of any employee must be determined on the basis of whether the
employee’s salary and duties meet the requirements of the regulations.</p>

<h3>22i03.  Acquisition agents, relocation agents, and property management
agents for a land-acquisition service.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>WHD
has found acquisition agents, relocation agents, and property management agents
to be exempt as follows (see FOH 22i00):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Acquisition Agents. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Acquisition
Agents (AAs) are employed to perform various tasks relating to the acquisition
of property for the employer’s clients. The AAs are responsible for purchasing
the property by negotiating with the property owners, analyzing property
appraisals, and making recommendations to the client using real estate
practices, legal concepts, governmental standards, and regulations. The AAs
represent the client in negotiations with the property owners and attorneys.
They regularly recommend to the client whether a reasonable compromise is
likely and further negotiations should be pursued, or whether to pursue
condemnation litigation. If the property owner has a legitimate basis for
seeking a substantially higher amount, the employees can recommend such
increases to the client. If the negotiation process fails, the AAs prepare the
lawsuit packages for condemnation proceedings, assist the client’s attorney,
and serve as an expert witness in mediation or trial. The AAs are also
responsible for preparing for the real estate closing, including preparing
closing documents. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When
the duties performed are those described above, the Acquisition Agents qualify
for the administrative exemption. The type of work performed by the AAs is
directly related to the general business operations of the employer’s clients.
As noted in 29 CFR § 541.201(b), work in the functional areas of purchasing,
procurement, and legal and regulatory compliance qualifies as work that is
directly related to management or general business operations. Additionally,
the many responsibilities of the AAs meet the discretion and independent
judgment standard. The AAs interpret management policies, negotiate, consult
with and provide expert advice to management, and bind the client financially
on significant matters, as discussed in several of the factors found in 29 CFR
§ 541.202(b). Furthermore, the AAs are similar to the insurance claims adjusters
listed as exempt in 29 CFR § 541.203, because they are responsible for
inspecting and determining the value of property including unique real
property, negotiating settlements, and making recommendations regarding
litigation when necessary. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Relocation Agents. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Relocation
Agents (RAs) assist in property appraisal and provide relocation assistance to
the owners and tenants of the property purchased by the client. The RAs
evaluate possible replacement properties and make recommendations as to the
amount of the “replacement housing payment” to be paid to the displaced
property owner. The RAs conduct research and analyze the best options for the
property owners. They also analyze possible alternative properties under
federal law. The RAs provide advice to the property owner on the moving process
and any relocation assistance that might be available to them. The RAs can also
make recommendations to the client to offer additional payments to the property
owner or to extend the occupancy period given to the displaced property owner.
They represent the client in appeals of the relocation payment amount, serving
as expert witnesses in administrative appeals and/or in litigation. Where the
tenant of the property is a business, the proceedings can be especially
complicated because there often is tenant-installed equipment or machinery
and/or significant build-outs by the tenant. In such cases, the relocation
benefits can be as much as a million dollars, and RAs have saved clients
hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time in appeals of business relocation
payments. The RAs also assist the property owner in preparations for the
property closing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When
the duties performed are those described above, the Relocation Agents qualify
for the administrative exemption. The type of work performed by the RAs is
directly related to the general business operations of the employer’s clients.
Like the AAs, the RAs work in the functional areas of procurement, government
relations, and legal and regulatory compliance, which are management and
general business operations functions. See 29 CFR § 541.201(a). The RAs
exercise discretion and independent judgment as to significant matters by
analyzing housing alternatives, recommending “replacement housing payments,”
and advising the client on significant financial matters. See 29 CFR
§ 541.202(b). The RAs are also similar to the insurance claims adjusters
listed as exempt in 29 CFR § 541.203 because they are responsible for
inspecting property, evaluating and making recommendations regarding the
“replacement housing payment,” negotiating settlements with property owners,
and representing management in any appeals. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Property Management Agents. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
Property Management Agents (PMAs) serve as spokespersons and representatives of
the client. They are responsible for dealing with governmental authorities,
utility companies, contractors and other consultants during the conversion of
the property for public use. They are responsible for contacting and developing
rapport with various local officials and explaining the project in order to
develop good relationships and ensure compliance with the law. Additionally,
they must protect the client’s investment by working with the officials to keep
the property safe from possible vandals and by making police reports in the
event of vandalism. The PMAs work with environmental consultants to address
environmental issues such as the presence of asbestos and to ensure compliance
with environmental protection laws. The PMAs coordinate all of their work and
develop an Operations and Maintenance Plan to ensure that the consultants and
contractors follow proper procedures. The PMAs also coordinate and direct the
demolition of the property, including preparing detailed specifications prior
to the bidding, advertising for bids, and conducting pre-bid meetings to explain
the project prior to accepting bids for the demolition work. They have
authority to use their knowledge and experience with contractors to select
preferred contractors from an approved list or to shop for the best price for
the work. After selection, the PMAs oversee and evaluate the work of all
contractors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When
the duties performed are those described above, the Property Management Agents
are exempt administrative employees. A PMA’s primary duty of serving as a
liaison between the client and various government agencies qualifies as
management and general business operations because it involves government
relations and legal and regulatory compliance. In addition, their work during
the bid process and in the selection of contractors relates to purchasing and
procurement, and their oversight activities involve quality control. The PMAs
implement management policies, carry out major assignments, and negotiate on
behalf of the company on significant matters, thereby fulfilling the exercise
of discretion and independent judgment requirement. See 29 CFR
§ 541.202(b).</p>

<h3>22i07.  Analysts ‑product  technology and marketing.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A
Product Technology and Marketing Analyst (PTA) who worked for a firm that
provides products and services to prevent soil erosion and strengthen retaining
walls and foundations of parking lots, bridges, levees, and buildings was found
to be an exempt administrative employee. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
PTA’s primary responsibility was to work independently with the company’s
Engineering and Design Group (EDG) to develop tests that measure the
performance of new products and assess the feasibility of novel uses of current
products.  For example, if an existing product has the potential to
stabilize and reinforce the lining of coal mine tunnels in a remote region, the
PTA reviews all relevant information regarding the environmental conditions and
the features of the mine.  The PTA then works with the EDG to develop a
test to measure the product’s performance under varying conditions.  The
PTA evaluates numerous factors, including the type of equipment needed to
create the precise environmental conditions and accurately capture the test
results.  Approximately 40 percent of the PTA’s working time is spent with
the EDG on tests for new and existing products.</p>
<p>Additionally,
approximately 30 percent of the PTA’s time is spent as a liaison to the
company’s sales professionals, who visit potential and current customers. 
During these visits, the sales professionals are confronted with questions from
customers regarding specific features/uses of the company’s products and how
they compare to competing products.  The sales professionals rely on the
PTA to provide them guidance on the appropriate responses to these customer
inquiries.  The PTA independently reaches conclusions regarding testing
methodology, testing results, and product performance that allow the company to
secure product sales by demonstrating that the company’s products meet customer
specifications or are superior to competing products.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
remainder of the PTA’s time is spent performing standardized tests on the
company’s products and preparing reports reflecting the test results and how
they compare to competitors.  The PTA reports directly to the company’s
Vice President of Process and Product Development.  The PTA receives at
least $455 per week on a salary basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
PTA’s duty of working with the EDG to develop tests that measure the
performance of new products and assess the feasibility of novel uses of current
products directly relates to the functional areas of quality control and
research.  The PTA’s duty of performing standardized tests on company
products and preparing reports on how those products compare to competitors’
products also directly relates to the functional area of research.  Other
duties, including assisting sales representatives in responding to customer
questions regarding specific features/uses of the company’s products, and
evaluating product features for potential customers, directly relate to the
functional area of marketing.  Therefore, the PTA’s primary duties involve
the “performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management
or general business operations of the employer or the employer’s
customers.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Section
541.202(b) sets out several factors to consider when determining whether an
employee exercises discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters
of significance. Examples of duties indicating the PTA “carries out major
assignments in conducting the operations of the business” include working
independently with the EDG to develop tests that measure performance of the
company’s new products and assess the feasibility of novel uses of the
company’s current products.  Also, in determining how specific
features/uses of the company’s products compare to competing products,
evaluating features within the context of scenarios posed by sales
professionals working in the field with customers, and making important
conclusions that allow the company to secure product sales, the PTA “performs
work that affects business operations to a substantial
degree.” Accordingly, the PTA’s primary duties “include the exercise of
discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of
significance.”  See FOH 22i00.</p>

<h3>22i09.  Case managers employed by a firm providing services to
individuals with disabilities.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Case
managers employed by a company which is a service provider for individuals with
disabilities were found to not be exempt under the administrative test. 
The company worked with physicians and other third parties to help consumers
with disabilities increase their self-sufficiency at home and in the
community.  The primary duty of case managers was to meet and to work with
consumers to gather information, to assess each consumer’s needs, to assess the
costs of care, to prepare a plan of care, and to identify and to implement
services to meet the consumer’s needs.  Case managers did not personally
deliver or administer services to the consumers, but were responsible for
planning and helping to obtain those services from third-party service
providers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Case
managers did not operate pursuant to written protocols or formulas. 
Rather, case managers drew upon their education and experience to identify and
to procure whatever group of services may be appropriate for each consumer,
maximizing that consumer’s ability to live outside an institution (such as a
group home, assisted living center, nursing home, or state hospital). 
Case managers may have sought information and input from colleagues and other
resources, but were independently responsible for developing a plan of care for
each consumer.  Each plan of care was, by necessity, driven by the
individual needs and abilities of the consumer.  A plan of care may have included
services such as advocacy/case management, independent living skills training,
peer support, physical therapy, cognitive therapy, speech therapy, occupational
therapy, or vocational rehabilitation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Case
managers also monitored the delivery of services in coordination with the
consumer and third-party service providers.  In addition, case managers
assisted consumers with related matters, including consumers’ eligibility for
benefits through Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and private insurance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Case
managers performed their work free from direct supervision.  Case managers
developed and implemented plans of care without the requirement of approval by
a superior, but their work was regularly reviewed by a company vice president
for quality and timeliness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
activities performed by these case managers were more related to providing the company’s
ongoing, day-to-day case management services for its consumers, which involved
duties such as assessing costs of care, preparing a plan of care, and identifying
and implementing services to meet the consumers’ needs, rather than performing
administrative functions directly related to managing either the company’s
business or any business of the company’s customers.  A case manager was
not primarily tasked with performing duties in any of the management or general
business functional areas described in 29 CFR § 541.201(b); nor was the case
manager primarily tasked with providing administrative services to the
employer’s customers as contemplated in 29 CFR § 541.201(c).  Therefore, case
managers did not qualify for the administrative exemption. See FOH 22i00.</p>

<h3>22i10.  Chefs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Chefs,
such as executive chefs and sous chefs, who have attained a four-year
specialized academic degree in a culinary arts program, generally meet the
duties requirements for the learned professional exemption.  The learned
professional exemption is not available to ordinary cooks who perform
predominantly routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work. See 29 CFR §
541.301(e)(6).  A chef whose primary duty is work requiring invention,
imagination, originality or talent, such as that involved in regularly creating
or designing unique dishes and menu items, may be considered for exemption as a
creative professional depending upon the facts.  However, there is a wide
variation in duties among chefs, and the creative professional exemption must
be applied on a case-by-case basis with particular focus on the creative duties
and abilities of the specific chef in question.  The Department intends that
the creative professional exemption extend only to truly “original” chefs, such
as those who work at five-star or gourmet establishments, whose primary duty is
the performance of work “requiring invention, imagination, originality or
talent.”</p>

soliciting donations for events, determining what benefits will be provided for
various levels of donation, contracting for services, designing, advertising,
marketing, and coordinating summer camp activities, planning the camp
activities, hiring and training staff, and planning camp budgets are performing
work in the area of budgeting, personnel management, advertising, marketing and
public relations. This work would meet the requirement that the work be office
or non-manual work directly related to the management or general business
operations of the employer. The primary duty includes the exercise of
discretion and independent judgment in matters of significance when the
Community Events Supervisors carry out major assignments in operations and have
the authority to bind the municipality in significant matters such as contracts
with vendors. See FOH 22i00.</p>

<h3>22i12.  Construction project superintendents.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A
construction project superintendent employed by an environmental engineering
and consulting company that performs construction projects on miscellaneous
government sites was found to be an exempt executive. The project
superintendent’s primary function was to supervise the day-to-day activities of
the construction project.  The superintendent oversaw the work of
subcontractors employed on the project and supervised the labor force employed
for the project, consisting of regular company personnel, project-specific
temporary personnel, and/or union personnel.  The superintendent usually
supervised at least two employees, if not more, throughout the duration of the
project.  The superintendent met with the client’s representatives, made
decisions regarding the scope of work of subcontractors, made purchasing
decisions as needed for the project, and reported and made recommendations to
the project manager regarding employee advancement, firing, and change of
status.  The superintendent was paid far in excess of $455.00 per
week. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
project superintendent’s duties are included in the type of activities
constituting “management” within the meaning of the regulations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Under
29 CFR § 541.100(a)(3), an exempt executive employee must “customarily and
regularly direct the work of two or more other employees.”  “Two or more
other employees” means two full-time employees or their equivalent.  29 CFR
§ 541.104(a).  Only other employees employed by the same employer may
be considered when making this determination under the executive exemption; the
supervision of employees of independent contractors, subcontractors, or any
other “non-employees” in relation to the employer are not considered for
purposes of meeting this test.  Assuming that the project superintendent
customarily and regularly supervises two employees who are employed by the
superintendent’s employer, this requirement is satisfied.  The failure to
meet this aspect of this test, however, would result in denial of the executive
exemption. See FOH 22i00.</p>

<h3>22i13.  Copy editors.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Book
club copy editors, employed by a direct marketing firm, whose duties included
the following, did not meet the administrative exemption test because they
performed “production” duties:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Reading club marketing promotional materials prepared by
copywriters and making any necessary corrections for structure, grammar,
comprehension, spelling, clarity, and accuracy,  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Correcting the keying of test versions, checking for
adherence to legal requirements for trademarks and copyrights, and ensuring
compliance with postal rules and scanning standards,  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Reviewing the accuracy of publication titles, authors’
names, code numbers, and prices, and ensuring that the company’s requirements
for style and procedures are met,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Organizing work priority to meet deadlines according to
promotion schedules, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
Making decisions on workflow and communicating these
decisions to club copywriters. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
“production versus staff” dichotomy is instructive when evaluating whether duties
are directly related to management or general business operations, but not
dispositive of exempt status. But, when work falls “squarely on the production
side of the line,” the administration/production dichotomy is determinative.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
primary duty of the copy editors described above falls squarely on the
production side of the line for their employer, a direct marketing firm, and,
thus, the employees are nonexempt. Their primary duty also involves the use of
skill rather than the exercise of discretion and independent judgment. See

generally do not meet the duties requirements for the administrative
exemption.  Such employees usually perform work involving the comparison of products
with established standards which are frequently catalogued.  Often, after
continued reference to the written standards, or through experience, the
employee acquires sufficient knowledge so that reference to written standards
is unnecessary.  The substitution of the employee’s memory for a manual of
standards does not convert the character of the work performed to exempt work
requiring the exercise of discretion and independent judgment. </p>

<p>Employees
in the financial services industry generally meet the duties requirements for
the administrative exemption if their duties include work such as collecting

or debts; determining which financial products best meet the customer’s needs
and financial circumstances; advising the customer regarding the advantages and
disadvantages of different financial products; and marketing, servicing or
promoting the employer’s financial products.  Courts have found employees who
represent the employer with the public, negotiate on behalf of the company, and
engage in sales promotion to be within the administrative exemption, even
though the employees also engaged in some inside sales activities.  However,
the administrative exemption is not available for employees whose primary duty
is to sell the employer’s financial products on a day-to-day basis directly to
consumers or who fail to exercise discretion and independent judgment with
respect to matters of significance to the management or general business
operations of the employer or of the employer’s customers. See FOH 22i00 and FOH

analysis and research, troubleshoots, resolves complex problems either in
person or by using remote control software, and ensures timely closeout of

<p> </p>
<p>Although
the upkeep of a computer system may be viewed as essential to an employer’s
business operations, the nature of the individual employee’s particular work,
and not the possible results or consequences of its performance, is the focus
of the analysis for determining if a particular employee is exempt.  To
qualify as an exempt administrative employee, therefore, the work performed
must itself relate to significant matters in the management or general business
operations of the employer.  In addition, performing highly skilled
technical work in troubleshooting computer problems does not, by itself,
demonstrate the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to
matters of significance.  As stated in 29 CFR § 541.202(e), “[t]he
exercise of discretion and independent judgment must be more than the use of
skill in applying well-established techniques, procedures or specific standards
described in manuals or other sources.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
primary duty of the IT Support Specialist as described above consists of
installing, configuring, testing, and troubleshooting computer applications,
networks, and hardware.  Maintaining a computer system and testing by
various systematic routines to see that a particular piece of computer
equipment or computer application is working properly according to the
specifications designed by others are examples of work that lacks the requisite
exercise of discretion and independent judgment within the meaning of the
administrative exemption.  Employees performing such activities are using
skills and procedures or techniques acquired by special training or
experience.  Their duties do not involve, with respect to matters of
significance, the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct,
and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been
considered as required by 29 CFR § 541.202(a).  Such work does not
involve formulating management policies or operating practices, committing the
employer in matters that have significant financial impact, negotiating and
binding the company on significant matters, planning business objectives, or
other indicators of exercising discretion and independent judgment with respect
to matters of significance discussed in 29 CFR § 541.202(b). 
Although minor aspects of the work (described as five to ten percent) include
participating in the design of client configurations and analyzing and
selecting new technology, the description of the tasks performed and the
decisions made by an IT Support Specialist does not demonstrate that their
primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with
respect to matters of significance to the management or general business
operations of the employer.  Therefore, the IT Support Specialist position
does not qualify for the administrative exemption under section 13(a)(1) of the
FLSA. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>With
respect to the Computer Employee Exemption, the following analysis applies: The
primary duty of the IT Support Specialist consists of installing, configuring,
testing, and troubleshooting computer applications, networks, and
hardware.  The primary duty of this employee does not involve the
“application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting
with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications.”  29 CFR § 541.400(b)(1).  Nor is the primary
duty of the IT Support Specialist “[t]he design, development, documentation,
analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs,
including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design
specifications,” see 29 CFR § 541.400(b)(2), “[t]he design, documentation,
testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating
systems,” 29 CFR § 541.400(b)(3), or “[a] combination of these duties, the
performance of which requires the same level of skills,”  29 CFR
§ 541.400(b)(4).  Because the primary duty of the IT Support
Specialist as described does not consist of duties similar to those discussed
in 29 CFR § 541.400(b)(1)-(4), the IT Support Specialist position does not
qualify for the computer professional employee exemption under FLSA sections
13(a)(1) and 13(a)(17).  See FOH 22i00.</p>

<h3>22i20.  Inspectors.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Ordinary
inspection work generally does not meet the duties requirements for the
administrative exemption.  Inspectors normally perform specialized work along
standardized lines involving well-established techniques and procedures which
may have been catalogued and described in manuals or other sources.  Such
inspectors rely on techniques and skills acquired by special training or
experience.  They have some leeway in the performance of their work but only
within closely prescribed limits. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR § 541.203(g) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   However,
inspectors whose primary duty is management of an area, including the
supervision of two or more subordinates, may qualify for the executive
exemption, provided that the other tests of the exemption are met. See FOH 22i00</p>

<h3>22i21.  Inspectors or investigators-public sector.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Public
sector inspectors or investigators of various types, such as police officers,
criminal investigators, liquor law investigators, probation officers, parole
agents, fire prevention or safety inspectors, building or construction
inspectors, health or sanitation inspectors, environmental or soils specialists
and similar employees, generally do not meet the duties requirements for the
administrative exemption because their primary duty typically does not involve
work “directly related to the management or general business operations of the
employer.” Rather, their primary duty involves producing the services that
their agency exists to produce. For example, in law enforcement organizations,
investigation activities are among the primary functions of the “business.” 
Therefore, investigations are more related to the day-to-day operations than to
the management or general business operations. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Such
employees also do not typically qualify for the administrative exemption
because their work involves the use of skills and technical abilities in
gathering factual information, applying known standards or prescribed
procedures, determining which procedure to follow, or determining whether
prescribed standards or criteria are met. Thus, the primary duty does not
typically include the exercise of discretion or independent judgment with
respect to matters of significance to the management or general business
operations of the employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Public
sector investigators whose primary duty is management may qualify for the
executive exemption, provided that the other tests of the exemption are met. See

<h3>22i22.  Instructors-assistant athletic.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Assistant
Athletic Instructors (AAIs) at colleges may qualify for exemption as teachers
under section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA and 29 CFR § 541.303.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>AAIs
teach proper skills and skill development to student-athletes and are required
to have a bachelor’s degree with a master’s degree (or additional experience)
preferred.  Their teaching responsibilities include instruction of physical
health, team concepts, and safety.  The AAIs, who work under the supervision of
a head coach, are responsible for designing instructions for individual
student-athletes and for specific team needs, and thus have a great deal of
independent discretion and judgment as to the manner and method of teaching. 
Students receive academic credit for their participation in collegiate team
sports. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Under
Reg. 541 a teacher is “any employee with a primary duty of teaching, tutoring,
instructing or lecturing in the activity of imparting knowledge and who is
employed and engaged in this activity as a teacher in an educational
establishment by which the employee is employed.” An AAI whose teaching
responsibilities encompass at least 50% or more of their time and include
instruction of physical health, team concepts, and safety is meeting the
primary duty test needed for the Reg. 541 teacher exemption. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There
is no minimum education or academic degree required under the regulations for
the teacher exemption.  Athletic instructors whose primary duty is teaching in
an educational establishment would qualify for the exemption whether or not
they have a particular academic degree.  By contrast, athletic instructors
whose primary duty is not related to teaching would not qualify for the teacher
exemption.  Also, the regulations do not require that exempt teachers be paid
on a salary basis.  Having a primary duty of teaching generally involves, “by
its very nature, exercising discretion and judgment.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
following duties are not related to teaching: developing effective recruitment
strategies; recruiting and following up on prospective students; researching
and targeting high schools and athletic camps as sources for potential
student-athletes; and visiting high schools and athletic camps to conduct
student interviews.  The amount of time spent is such duties must be considered
when determining whether the AAI meets the primary duty test for exemption as a
teacher. Colleges generally would qualify as educational establishments for
purposes of the teacher exemption.  An “educational establishment” is defined
as “an elementary or secondary school system, an institution of higher learning
or other educational institution.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
AAIs spend more than 50% of their time teaching in an educational
establishment,  they qualify for exemption from the FLSA’s minimum wage and
overtime pay requirements. See FOH 22i00.</p>

<h3>22i23.  Insurance claims adjusters.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Insurance claims adjusters generally meet the duties
requirements for the administrative exemption, whether they work for an
insurance company or other type of company, if their duties include activities
such as interviewing insureds, witnesses and physicians; inspecting property
damage; reviewing factual information to prepare damage estimates; evaluating
and making recommendations regarding coverage of claims; determining liability
and total value of a claim; negotiating settlements; and making recommendations
regarding litigation.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.203(a) </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>(b) 
</b><b>Varying levels of authority.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In
the insurance industry, there are insurance claims adjusters with varying
levels of authority.  The claims adjusting duties performed by these
individuals when it is in the functional area of insurance is work directly
related to management or general business operations of the employer or the
employer’s customers and thus meets the second criteria of the administrative
exemption test.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In
order to qualify for the administrative exemption, the employee must also meet
the third criteria of the exemption test, “…primary duty must include the
exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of
significance.” Generally, the exercise of discretion and independent judgment
involves comparing and evaluating possible courses of conduct and then acting
or making a decision after considering the various possibilities.  The term
“matters of significance” refers to the level of consequence or importance of
the work performed.  The exercise of discretion and independent judgment
includes the employee’s authority to make independent choices free of immediate
supervision but does not preclude higher level review. An indicator of the claims
examiner’s exercise of discretion and independent judgment is the level of
supervision. For example, does the claims adjuster’s supervisor only spot-check
work or must the adjuster seek approval from a supervisor for settlements?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
exercise of discretion and independent judgment must be more than applying
specific standards or procedures found in manuals. The following are examples
of duties performed by claims adjusters that are more than applying specific
standards: evaluating independent medical examinations, evaluating
investigations of accident scenes, hiring and interacting with nursing services
to assist claimants to return to work, approving litigation strategy,
participating in hiring experts, serving as lead negotiator in settlement
discussions and using their own judgment about what the facts show, who is
liable, what a claim is worth, and how to handle negotiations with the claimant
in order to achieve a successful resolution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Claims
adjusters who perform their duties under close supervision or in consultation
with supervisors and who have no, or limited authority, to make independent
choices do not meet the third criteria of the administrative exemption. See FOH
22i00.</p>

<h3>22i24.              Investigators-background.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
range of duties performed in the process of making investigations, including
gathering evidence; interviewing witnesses; reviewing medical, financial,
employment and other data; preparing reports for review by a client or superior;
and other similar work, is not work “which is directly related to the
management or general business operations” of the employer where the employer
provides such services to clients for a fee. The activities performed by
investigators are more related to providing ongoing day-to-day investigative
services - the production work of the employer-than they are to exempt
administrative duties. The fact that investigators plan their own workload,
make decisions on whether to further pursue a given lead, and make other
similar decisions does not elevate the work to the level of exercising
“discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance”
to the managing of their employer’s or their employer’s client’s business. See

<h3>22i25.  Journalists.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Journalists
may satisfy the duties requirements for the creative professional exemption if
their primary duty is work requiring invention, imagination, originality or
talent, as opposed to work which depends primarily on intelligence, diligence
and accuracy.  Employees of newspapers, magazines, television and other media
are not exempt creative professionals if they only collect, organize and record
information that is routine or already public, or if they do not contribute a
unique interpretation or analysis to a news product.  Thus, for example,
newspaper reporters who merely rewrite press releases or who write standard
recounts of public information by gathering facts on routine community events
are not exempt creative professionals.  Reporters also do not qualify as exempt
creative professionals if their work product is subject to substantial control
by the employer.  However, journalists may qualify as exempt creative
professionals if their primary duty is performing on the air in radio,
television or other electronic media; conducting investigative interviews;
analyzing or interpreting public events; writing editorials, opinion columns or
other commentary; or acting as a narrator or commentator.  </p>

<h3>22i26.  Location managers in the motion picture industry.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Location
Managers, who typically choose a location for filming with approval from the
director and production management, negotiate the site’s rental, contract for
all necessary utilities, apply for all necessary governmental services and
permits, create and enforce rules specific to the filming locations based on
that site’s specific circumstances and designed to comply with state and local
law, act as a liaison between the production company and local property owners
and residents, and secure final rental payment for the property owner including
negotiating any claim of property damage, have been found exempt.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before
the 2004 revisions to the part 541 regulations, Location Managers of motion
picture companies were specifically cited as a type of qualifying
administrative employee who performed special assignments away from the
employer’s place of business.  Based upon their duties––such as selecting
locations, entering into rental agreements, and developing and implementing
rules for employees to follow on location––it appears that the Location
Managers are primarily engaged in the budgeting, procurement, and personnel
management functions described in 29 CFR § 541.201 as types of work
directly related to assisting with the running or servicing of the employer’s
business. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
Location Managers’ primary duties include the exercise of discretion and
independent judgment.  For example, the Location Manager formulates
management policies when creating and enforcing regulations for the production
crew based upon the site’s requirements.  Also, the Location Manager
commits the employer in financial matters and negotiates and binds the company
regarding significant matters when the Location Manager chooses the location,
negotiates the site’s rental, obtains contracts with local private resources,
obtains necessary permits from local government, and represents the company’s
position to the property owner.  Finally, the Location Manager represents
the company when acting as a liaison between the company and the property owner
and any disgruntled local residents, and when resolving the final balance of
account between the company and property owner, including whether the company
owes for any damages done to the rental property.  Such activities involve
the requisite exercise of discretion and independent judgment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Accordingly,
the position of Location Manager, as described above, satisfies the
requirements for the administrative exemption. See FOH 22i00.</p>

<h3>22i27.  Managers‑convention and visitors service sales, employed by a
city.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When
the primary duty of a convention and visitors service sales manager employed by
a city is performing office or non-manual duties that are directly related to
management or general business operations of the employer, the second test of
the administrative exemption is met. Examples of such duties include the
following: marketing and promotional work to enhance the city as a destination
for conventions and visitors; working closely with the local hospitality
industry and other city departments to coordinate conventions and ensure
efficient meeting arrangements for the attendees; conducting research to
identify potential clients; preparing and presenting bids for meetings and
conferences; designing promotional brochures and flyers; attending conferences
of professional meeting planners and exhibit show associations to generate
leads; handling computerized database bookings; and preparing bills for
payment. The employee might also perform some clerical and support services for
the convention and visitors services director as needed. This employee is
engaged in marketing activities that are intended to enhance the city’s image
as a potential meeting place and thus promote economic growth.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When
the employee operates under only minimal supervision, researches and selects
potential clients, designs and creates promotional materials, and prepares and
presents bids for meetings and conferences to potential clients, determines
what amenities the city will offer to a group and the level of staffing the
city will provide to assist a group, these duties include the exercise of
discretion and independent judgment in matters of significant economic impact
on the city. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although
the employee is required to perform clerical and support duties for the
convention and visitors services director as needed, this nonexempt work does
not appear to be the employee’s primary duty. Thus, the employee performing
duties described above qualifies for the administrative exemption.  See FOH

<p>When

management policy dictates that the following duties are to be performed only
by the manager:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
printing the daily sales report, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
checking inventory status,</p>

<p>(c)  
auditing cash receipts,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
delivering cash receipts to the bank - </p>
<p> </p>
<p>such
duties do not defeat the exemption. They are management functions for purposes
of meeting the primary duty test for executives, as these functions relate to
the maintenance of production and sales records, and to providing security of
the employer’s property. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Training
of employees, including a new manager, is also exempt management work under 29
CFR § 541.102. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Working
as a station attendant is nonexempt work. Substantial nonexempt work cannot be
routinely assigned to an employee without calling into question the application
of the exemption to that employee. However, so long as an otherwise exempt
station manager only performs attendant duties occasionally, for up to a full
day, a few times per year, at infrequent intervals, the primary duty test will
still be met. See FOH 22i00.</p>

<h3>22i29.  Managers-human resources or personnel.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Human
resources managers who formulate, interpret or implement employment policies
and management consultants who study the operations of a business and propose
changes in organization generally meet the duties requirements for the
administrative exemption.  However, personnel clerks who “screen” applicants to
obtain data regarding their minimum qualifications and fitness for employment
generally do not meet the duties requirements for the administrative
exemption.  Such personnel clerks typically will reject all applicants who do
not meet minimum standards for the particular job or for employment by the
company.  The minimum standards are usually set by the exempt human resources
manager or other company officials, and the decision to hire from the group of
qualified applicants who do meet the minimum standards is similarly made by the
exempt human resources manager or other company officials.  Thus, when the
interviewing and screening functions are performed by the human resources
manager or personnel manager who makes the hiring decision or            makes
recommendations for hiring from the pool of qualified applicants, such duties
constitute exempt work, even though routine, because this work is directly and
closely related to the employee’s exempt functions as discussed in 29 CFR §
541.703.  </p>

<h3>22i30.  Managers-loss prevention.</h3>
<p>            </p>
<p>A
Loss Prevention Manager (LPM), employed by a retailer, who has the primary duty
of effectively implementing a loss prevention and shortage control program by,
among other duties:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Analyzing inventory results,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Allocating store Loss Prevention resources to successfully
reduce inventory shortage,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Focusing prevention activities on high shortage departments,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Identifying paperwork control weaknesses and implementing
procedures to correct them, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
Conducting audits for compliance and ensuring store
follow-up on price accuracy initiatives, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)  
Reviewing cash discrepancies to keep the store within
allowable guidelines, and identifying cash registers with unacceptable
shortages, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)  
Regularly reviewing loss prevention exception reports for
signs of dishonesty,is performing work which directly relates to the functional
areas of accounting, auditing, and quality control discussed in 29 CFR § 541.201(b),
and thus may qualify as an exempt administrative employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Duties
performed by the LPM such as interviewing all loss prevention candidates,
conducting and supervising training for subordinates on a continual basis, and
providing direction for subordinates also directly relate to the functional
areas of personnel management and human resources.  Ensuring training standards
for associates regarding emergency procedures, robbery, fire, etc.,  is work
directly related to the functional area of safety and health. An LPM’s typical
work day consists of performing office or non-manual work. Therefore, the LPM’s
primary duty involves the “performance of office or non-manual work directly related
to the management or general business operations of the employer.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A
typical LPM’s primary duty “includes the exercise of discretion and independent
judgment with respect to matters of significance.” An LPM who is working
independently has certain decision-making authority that is “free from
immediate direction or supervision.”  When selecting appropriate steps to
address the problem of inventory shortage and pursuing the selected course of
action, an LPM compares and evaluates possible courses of conduct, and acts or
makes a decision after the various possibilities have been considered as
discussed in 29 CFR § 541.202(a). The LPM’s primary duty of implementing the
loss prevention and shortage control program for a store, and supervisory work
where an LPM is in charge of subordinates, demonstrates that the employee
“implement[s] management policies or operating practices.”  When implementing
the loss prevention and shortage control program for the store, the LPM
“performs work that affects business operations to a substantial degree”
because the effective performance of such duty is essential for the
profitability of the store and, in fact, frequently determines the store’s
success or failure. When developing store-specific programs to meet or exceed the
store’s shortage goals, the LPM “carries out major assignments in conducting
the operations of the business.”  In determining what internal investigations
to pursue and when to conduct interviews, in ascertaining prosecutable cases,
and in investigating harassment allegations, the LPM “investigates and resolves
matters of significance on behalf of management.”  In addition, in consulting
with and providing expert advice to store management with respect to the loss
prevention and shortage control program, the LPM “provides consultation or
expert advice to management.”  Therefore, the LPM’s duties meet several of the
factors in 29 CFR § 541.202(b) indicating the sufficient “exercise of
discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance”
and, as such, may qualify for the administrative exemption. See FOH 22i00.</p>

<h3>22i33.  Medical technologists-registered or certified.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Registered or certified medical technologists who have
successfully completed three academic years of pre-professional study in an
accredited college or university plus a fourth year of professional course work
in a school of medical technology approved by the Council of Medical Education
of the American Medical Association generally meet the duties requirements for
the learned professional exemption.  </p>

<b>Radiology technologists.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Radiology
technologists (RTs) have been found not to be exempt from the minimum wage and
overtime requirements of the FLSA. The RT’s primary duty does not require
“advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a
prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.” Their work has been
found not to be “work which is predominantly intellectual in character, and
which includes work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and
judgment, as distinguished from performance of routine mental, manual,
mechanical or physical work.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
RT position requires successful completion of a two-to-three-year radiology
technology program accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in
Radiologic Technology or some other manner of accreditation acceptable to the
American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT).  The RTs must pass
an ARRT examination for registration.  To renew the ARRT registration, an
RT must meet certain continuing education requirements every two years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
requirement that an RT complete a two- to three-year radiology technology
program accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic
Technology (or some other manner of accreditation acceptable to the ARRT),
along with an ARRT examination for registration, does not meet the “advanced
knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged
course of specialized intellectual instruction” standard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Duties
of RT’s have been found to be: reviewing physicians’ orders for patient
examinations; ensuring that the examining room is properly prepared for the
procedure; visiting patients to determine their tolerance to the examination
and positioning; preparing patient information cards that are included on the
film for identification; positioning the patients to assure that the
radiologist can see and access the proper area for the imaging procedure;
administering contrast and other chemicals orally or intravenously; setting
technical factors on equipment, such as penetration and length of the imaging
power; checking radiation and imaging power factors for safety to the patient,
technologist, and equipment; and operating the equipment for radiation and
other imaging power exposure.  RTs take the film to the darkroom for
automatic processing and evaluate the adequacy of the film for reading by the
radiologist.  As needed, the RTs take additional images.  They may
also assist the radiologist in understanding particular cases and images
taken. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following
the procedures, the RTs return patients to their proper area; clean tables and
change linens; clean cassettes, aprons, gloves, and wheelchairs; check
cassettes for contact and leakage, and aprons and gloves for leakage; and clean
the film processor as required.  They ensure that proper notations are
made in the patients’ records, and participate in maintaining departmental
files, coordinating and scheduling of patients, and maintaining department
inventories.  The RTs maintain records of use according to state and
federal regulations.  They perform daily instrument calibration procedures
on all instruments, make minor repairs to equipment, and report any major
equipment problems to the department head.  RTs carry out all of their
duties without the need for constant supervision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although
the RTs’ work involves the use of advanced skills and procedures that are
vitally important to the professional work of the radiologist who analyzes and
interprets the images, the RTs’ work does not appear to be “work which is
predominantly intellectual in character, and which includes work requiring the
consistent exercise of discretion and judgment, as distinguished from
performance of routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work.” 
29 CFR § 541.301(b).  The procedural work performed by the RTs
is highly skilled and requires significant training, but seems to be more in
the character of routine mental, manual, mechanical and physical processes than
intellectual work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and
judgment.  The “learned professional” activity in this area is the
practice of medicine involved in the analysis and interpretation of the images
developed, which is performed by the radiologist. See FOH 22i00</p>

<h3>22i34.  Mortgage loan officers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In
the financial service industry, there are persons classified as “mortgage loan
officers,” “mortgage loan consultants,” “mortgage loan representatives,” “mortgage
loan originators,” “mortgage bankers,” and similar titles. The following are
typical duties of these individuals, referred to here as mortgage loan
officers: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Contact potential customers after receiving internal leads,
leads generated by direct mail or other marketing activity,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Collect required financial information from customers,
including information about income,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Run credit reports,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Enter collected financial information into computer program
that identifies which loan products may be offered to customers based on the
financial information provided by the customer,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
Assess the identified loan products and discuss with customers
the terms and conditions of particular loans,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)  
Match customer needs with one of the company’s loan
products,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)  
Compile customer documents to forward to underwriter or
loan processor, and </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)  May
finalize documents for closing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
primary duty of mortgage loan officers performing the typical duties shown
above is making sales. These duties are the production work of the employer
rather than duties which are directly related to the management or business
operations of the employer. Mortgage loan officers typically perform their
duties for homeowners, who are not involved in management or general business
operations contemplated by these regulations; therefore, a typical mortgage
loan officer’s primary duty is not related either to the employer’s management
or general business operations or to those of the employer’s customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A
mortgage loan officer who performs the typical duties described above has a
primary duty of making sales for the employer and, therefore, does not qualify
as a bona fide administrative employee exempt under section 13(a)(1) of the
FLSA. See FOH 22i00.</p>

<h3>22i35.  Museum curators.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When
the primary duty of a museum curator is performing non-manual duties that are
directly related to management or general business operations of the employer,
the second test of the administrative exemption is met. Examples of such duties
include the following: maintaining the quality of the museum collection in
accordance with museum management principles and practices (quality control);
soliciting and evaluating additions to the museum’s collection (similar to
purchasing); developing educational components to present information regarding
the exhibits (research); assisting in fundraising and writing grant proposals
(finance and budgeting); managing special projects such as collecting oral
histories (research); and establishing and implementing a volunteer tour guide
program (marketing).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
museum curator’s primary duty must include the exercise of discretion and
independent judgment with respect to matters of significance to the management
or general business operations of the employer in order to meet the third test
of the administrative exemption. Examples of duties that curators perform that
indicate the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to
matters of significance are the following: establishing and implementing
volunteer tour guide programs (formulating operating practices); developing
education materials to be presented by volunteer guides (formulating operating
practices); developing the changing exhibits (implementing operating
practices); and writing grant proposals (involvement in the long-term or
short-term business objectives). See FOH 22i00.</p>

<h3>22i36.  Nurses.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Registered
nurses who are registered by the appropriate State examining board generally
meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption.  (Note,
however, that many registered nurses are paid on an hourly basis rather than on
a salary or fee basis, and for that reason are entitled to overtime pay.) 
Licensed practical nurses and other similar health care employees, however,
generally do not qualify as exempt learned professionals because possession of
a specialized advanced academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for entry
into such occupations.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.301(e)(2) </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>22i37.  Occupational therapists-certified, assistants.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>WHD
has found Certified Occupational Therapist Assistants (COTAs) employed by a
school district to be nonexempt as learned professionals.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
primary duty of a COTA is assisting occupational therapists in providing
therapeutic educational programs for students.  According to the school
district’s COTA job description, the only educational requirement is that which
is sufficient to obtain certification by the state Board of Occupational
Therapy Examiners.  One of the prerequisites for certification by the state is
the completion of “at least 60 academic semester credits or the equivalent from
an accredited institution of higher education.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
primary duty test under the learned professional exemption requires that:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The employee must perform work requiring advanced knowledge,
</p>
<p>(b)  
The advanced knowledge must be in a field of science or
learning, and </p>
<p>(c)  
The advanced knowledge must be customarily acquired by a
prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>COTAs
did not meet the primary duty test. The COTAs’ primary duty does not require
“knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily
acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.” 
Occupations that “require only a four-year degree in any field or a two-year
degree as a standard prerequisite for entrance into the field . . . do not
qualify for the learned professional exemption.”  69 FR 22121, 22150 (Apr. 23,
2004). Completion of 60 semester hours does not qualify as a “prolonged course
of specialized intellectual instruction. COTAs also did not meet the definition
of a registered or certified medical technologist.  The regulations contain
specific academic requirements for exemption:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Registered
or certified medical technologists who have successfully completed three
academic years of pre-professional study in an accredited college or university
plus a fourth year of professional course work in a school of medical
technology approved by the Council of Medical Education of the American Medical
Association generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional
exemption.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR § 541.301(e)(1).  Becoming a COTA only requires 60 semester hours of study,
rather than the more rigorous course of study required for registered or
certified medical technologists.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
existence of a mandatory, accredited certification program for COTAs, standing
alone, does not satisfy the regulatory requirement for a prolonged course of
specialized intellectual instruction for entry into the field.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Accredited curriculums and certification programs are
relevant to determining exempt learned professional status to the extent they
provide evidence that a prolonged course of specialized intellectual
instruction has become a standard prerequisite for entrance into the occupation
as required under section 541.301.  Neither the identity of the certifying
organization nor the mere fact that certification is required is determinative,
if certification does not involve a prolonged course of specialized intellectual
instruction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>69
FR at 22157</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Consequently,
because the occupational therapist assistant occupation does not require
“knowledge of an advanced type . . . customarily acquired by a prolonged course
of specialized intellectual instruction,” these employees do not qualify for
the “learned professional” exemption.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Additionally,
the COTAs do not qualify for the exemption for administrative employees in
educational establishments.  See 29 CFR § 541.204.  Section 541.204 provides an
exemption for employees “whose primary duty is performing administrative
functions directly related to academic instruction or training in an
educational establishment or department or subdivision thereof.”  29 CFR §
541.204(a)(2).  Section 541.204(c)(2), however, states that “jobs relating to
the health of the students . . . do not perform academic administrative
functions” and do not fulfill the requirements for the educational
establishments exemption. See FOH 22i00.</p>

<h3>22i38.  Paralegals.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Paralegals and legal assistants generally do not qualify as
exempt learned professionals because an advanced specialized academic degree is
not a standard prerequisite for entry into the field.  Although many paralegals
possess general four-year advanced degrees, most specialized paralegal programs
are two-year associate degree programs from a community college or equivalent
institution.  See FOH 22i00.</p>

<b>Paralegals with a specialized 4-year degree.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
learned professional exemption may be available for paralegals who possess
advanced specialized degrees in other fields and apply advanced knowledge in
that professional field in the performance of their paralegal duties. For
example, if a law firm hires an engineer as a paralegal to provide expert
advice on product liability cases or to assist on patent matters, that engineer
would qualify for the learned professional exemption. See FOH 22i00.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHD
Letter FLSA 2005-09NA </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Paralegals – Administrative exemption.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
work of paralegals and legal assistants will not generally meet the discretion
and independent judgment test of the administrative exemption and thus an
analysis of whether their work is related to management or general business
operations is not necessary. Paralegals perform duties using particular skills
and knowledge rather than exercising the level of discretion and independent
judgment required by section 29 CFR § 541.202(a)(3). When paralegals research
and prepare reports, it is generally the attorneys who exercise discretion and
independent judgment because they receive and decide whether or how to act on
the information in the reports. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although
paralegals may work independently and use their own judgment as to how to
prioritize their work assignments, including how the projects will be executed
and how much time to spend on each assignment, it is not sufficient that an
employee makes decisions regarding relatively insignificant matters or that an
employee makes limited decisions, within clearly “prescribed parameters.” See
Clark v. J.M. Benson Co., Inc., 789 F.2d 282, 287-88 (4th Cir. 1986) and
Dalheim v. KDFW-TV, 706 F. Supp. 493, 509 (N.D. Tex. 1998), aff’d, 918 F.2d
1220 (5th Cir. 1990). Rather, there must be the exercise of discretion and
independent judgment on matters of significance or consequence related to the
management or general business operations of the employer or the employer’s
customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A
typical paralegal does not formulate or implement management policies, utilize
authority to waive or deviate from established policies, provide expert advice,
or plan business objectives as required to be exempt under 29 CFR § 541.202(b).
In addition, most jurisdictions have strict prohibitions against the
unauthorized practice of law by laypersons. Under the American Bar
Association’s Code of Professional Responsibility, a delegation of legal tasks
to a lay person is proper only if the lawyer maintains a direct relationship
with the client, supervises the delegated work, and has complete professional
responsibility for the work produced. The implication of such strictures is
that paralegal employees would not have the amount of authority to exercise independent
judgments with regard to legal matters necessary to bring them within the
administrative exemption. See FOH 22i00.</p>

relative importance of the engineer duties must be weighed with that of the
sales duties. When the employee’s engineering background and abilities are used
to determine the engineering specifications, resolve engineering related
problems, and provide technical support, which result in making the sale or
securing the order, the importance of the engineering duties will outweigh that

<h3>22i44.  School resource officers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>School
Resource Officers (SROs) employed at an independent school district qualified
for the administrative exemption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
SROs’ primary duty was to provide for the safety and security of the students,
staff, and property within the school system by planning to prevent safety and
security problems and by responding immediately to deal with any disruption or
criminal activity.  Among their qualifications, SROs were licensed
pursuant to the state’s Peace Officer’s Standards and Training
Certification.  The SROs’ duties included providing consulting advice to
school administrators on plans for safety, emergency preparedness, traffic
flow, evacuation, lighting, and video surveillance, as well as other
safety/security issues; providing training to students, faculty,
administrators, and parent groups regarding safety issues, such as personal
safety, gun safety, bus safety, and drug and gang awareness; coordinating
security for extracurricular events; serving as liaison/facilitator between the
school system and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate the law
enforcement efforts of the local jurisdiction with regard to the schools, and
to develop a communication network between administration, staff, students and
parents within the “cluster” schools; creating and maintaining written case
files of criminal acts by students and reports of deprived, abused, or
neglected children and sharing this information with the school administrator,
school social worker, agencies in the law enforcement and judiciary systems,
and the local family and children’s services department, when appropriate;
advising regarding what law enforcement measures are appropriate when the
school administrator or SRO believes an incident is a violation of the law;
investigating suspected criminal activity on school property; and making
arrests on school property.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In
performing the duties above, the SRO decided whether a situation requires
immediate action, whether to charge a violation, whether to make an arrest, and
whether to refer a case to the district attorney for prosecution.  The SRO
independently determined and planned his or her daily work schedules (e.g.,
whether to visit a particular school at a particular time and what to do at
that location).  In addition, the SRO’s recommendations to faculty and
staff were usually implemented (e.g., advice on fire drills, lighting,
landscaping, traffic flow, safety, and emergency preparedness plans).  The
SRO also provided training to faculty, staff, and students and made purchases
on behalf of the school (e.g., buying safety equipment).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each
SRO had an office at a high school and served as the Resource Officer for a
cluster of schools, typically a high school and five to seven feeder middle and
elementary schools.  An SRO’s typical work day consisted of working in an
office at a high school writing reports or performing similar desk work,
performing training, providing advice to faculty and staff, working in the
field patrolling, and doing investigative work.  The field work was
incidental to the SRO’s primary duty, which is office work, and did not require
physical stamina or repetitive movements.  The SRO was minimally
supervised by the Manager of Safety and Security.  Moreover, in certain
cases, some of the cluster schools may employ security guards, but the SRO has
no direct supervisory responsibility over the security guards in such
cases.  The SRO has an annual discretionary budget of $15,000 to $20,000
for purchasing safety/security related items, such as cameras and traffic
safety cones.  Purchase orders above the discretionary budget require
supervisory approval.  The SROs are paid at least $455 per week on a
salary basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
SROs performed office or non-manual work because an SRO’s typical work day
consisted of working in an office writing reports or performing similar
deskwork, performing training, and providing recommendations and advice to
faculty and staff.  In addition, any field work performed by the SRO is
incidental to the SRO’s primary duty, which was office work, and did not
require physical stamina or repetitive movements.  The SROs’ primary duty
of providing for the safety and security of the students, staff, and property
within the school system by planning to prevent safety and security problems and
by responding immediately to deal with any disruption or criminal activity,
which may include, for example, providing consulting advice to school
administrators on plans for safety, emergency preparedness, traffic flow,
evacuation, lighting, and video surveillance and providing training to
students, faculty, administrators, and parent groups regarding safety-related
issues, directly related to the functional areas of safety and health discussed
in 29 CFR § 541.201(b). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
SROs’ employers were public educational entities rather than police departments
or security companies whose primary operations were law enforcement and
security, and as a result, the SROs’ activities could not be categorized as
production operations for their employers.  Therefore, the SROs’ primary
duty involved the “performance of office or non-manual work directly related to
the management or general business operations of the employer.”  29 CFR
§ 541.200(a)(2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
primary duty of the SRO’s described above “includes the exercise of discretion
and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.”  29 CFR
§ 541.200(a)(3).  The SRO is minimally supervised.  The SRO has
an annual discretionary budget of $15,000 to $20,000 for purchasing
safety/security related items. Such duties as providing the extensive
recommendations and advice noted above to faculty and staff that are usually
implemented satisfy one of the regulatory factors in 29 CFR § 541.202(b)
for determining whether an employee exercises discretion and independent
judgment with respect to matters of significance, specifically, that the
“employee provide consultation or expert advice to management.” In addition, by
serving as a liaison/facilitator between the school system and local law
enforcement agencies to coordinate the law enforcement efforts of the local
jurisdiction relative to the schools, and to develop a communication network
between administration, staff, students, and parents within the cluster
schools, the SRO formulates and implements management policies or operating
practices. See 29 CFR § 541.202(b). See FOH 22i00.</p>

the field of their degree will meet the learned professional test provided that
the degree is a customary requirement for entry into the particular field of
social work in which the work is being performed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A
Case Worker or Case Manager who is only required to have attained a bachelor’s
degree in any field, or a broad field, i.e. “social sciences,” does not have
“specialized academic training” necessary to qualify for the learned
professional exemption. See 29 CFR § 541.301(d). See FOH 22i00.</p>

projects for the employer (such as purchasing, selling or closing all or part
of the business, negotiating a real estate transaction or a collective
bargaining agreement, or designing and implementing productivity improvements)

Opinion Letter FLSA 2006-26 </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23a00 - General provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 13(a) (8) provides an exemption
from the MW and OT provisions of the FLSA for “any employee employed in
connection with the publication of any weekly, semiweekly, or daily newspaper
with a circulation of less than four thousand the major part of which
circulation is within the county where published or counties contiguous
thereto”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The exemption applies only where the
major part of the newspaper’s circulation is within the county in which it is
published, within contiguous counties, or within some combination of these
counties. The exemption would apply, for example, where none of the circulation
is within the county in which a newspaper is published provided a major part of
its circulation is within contiguous counties. A “contiguous county”, for
purposes of Sec 13(a)(8), means a county which at some point shares a common
boundary with the county in which the newspaper is published. “Contiguous
counties” need not be in the same State.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23a01 - Newspaper devoted to court news and legal notices.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A daily publication which contains
news of the local courts, legal notices, other matters pertaining to court
proceedings, and advertisements is a newspaper within the meaning of the Sec
13(a)(8) exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23a02 - Shopping news publication.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A publication, usually referred to as
a shopping news or guide, which contains some news even though small in amount
and some advertising copy is considered a newspaper within the meaning of Sec
13(a)(8).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23a03 - Publication of two or more newspapers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where a publishing company publishes
more than one newspaper, each newspaper may be treated separately for the
purpose of determining whether the circulation of such papers is less than the
maximum set forth in Sec 13(a)(8). If the situation is one where the purported
separate publications are properly to be regarded as one and the same newspaper,
the total circulation of both newspapers would have to be considered in
determining whether the exemption applies. If the two publications, in addition
to their different mastheads, carry different local news items, the
publications should be considered as two different newspapers in testing for
the exemption under Sec 13(a)(8).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23a04 - Employees of a printer.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of a printer who merely
prints the newspaper for a publisher are not within the Sec 13(a)(8) exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23a05 - Nonexempt work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Except as provided by IB 786.250 (see
FOH 23a06), the Sec 13(a)(8) exemption does not apply to an employee in a
workweek during which, in addition to his work on an exempt newspaper, he
performs any other work which is subject to the Act (including enterprise
coverage) and not within the scope of some other exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23a06 - Job printing.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Job printing pursuant to IB 786.250
refers to printing work for outside customers and does not include printing
done by the employer at his own establishment for his own business operations.
For example, the printing of a newspaper with a circulation of 4,000 or more which
is published by the same employer is not considered job printing.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23a07 - Printing a newspaper published by others.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The mere printing of a newspaper
which is published by others is to be regarded as job printing for purposes of
Sec 13(a)(8). (See FOH 23a06.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23a08 - Circulation.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The word “circulation” as used in Sec
13(a)(8) includes all copies of the publication circulated or distributed by
mail or otherwise, whether paid for or free.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23a09 - Newspaper selling office supplies and stationery.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Some small town newspapers sell at
retail small amounts of ordinary office supplies and stationery at the
newspaper offices. Any employee who engages in the sale of such items will not
be exempt if the newspaper is part of a Sec 3(s)(1) enterprise or if any of the
sales work is individually covered. However, WH would not consider the
exemption lost where the sales are made to individuals or small local
businesses and the only element of interstate commerce would be that some
portion of the stationery might be used in the writing of interstate letters.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23a10 - Circulars.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Circulars ordinarily lack the
characteristics of a newspaper.  However, work performed by a publisher who
publishes circulars for incorporation into a Sec 13(a)(8) exempt newspaper
which he publishes would be exempt even if the printing of such circulars were
“jobbed out”.</p>

<h3>23b00 - General provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 13(d), first part, exempts from
the provisions of Secs 6, 7, and 12 “any employee engaged in the delivery of
newspapers to the consumer”. The term newspaper is considered as having the
same meaning under Sec 13(d) as under Sec 13(a)(8).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23b01 - Effect of nonexempt work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   As Sec 13(d) is a CL exemption as
well as an MW and OT exemption, there can be no tolerance for nonexempt work.
If any of the work performed by the minor is not exempt under the section, the
exemption does not apply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  However, if the minors are 14 and 15
years old, their employment may be permissible even though the Sec 13(d)
exemption is defeated by the performance of nonexempt work. For example, if the
duties of the minors consist wholly of exempt work and nonexempt work which is
permitted by CL Reg 3, their employment would be permissible provided it
complies with the conditions of that Reg. One of the conditions is that the
work must not be performed so as to be a part of the manufacturing process and
must not be performed in any manufacturing or processing room or work place.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23b02 - Newspaper folding.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The folding of newspapers by a minor
as an incident to his own sale or delivery of the newspapers to individual
consumers is work exempt under Sec 13(d), whether performed in or out of the
newspaper plant. However, the folding by the minor of newspapers for delivery
by other newsboys does not constitute work which is immediately incidental to
his own delivery work, and therefore, is not exempt.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23b03 - Soliciting subscriptions to newspapers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Situations may be encountered where
employees are engaged in the door-to-door solicitation of newspaper
subscriptions. Where the employees carry current issues of the newspaper and
attempt to sell them as part of their solicitation work, such employment is
considered to be within the Sec 13(d) exemption. The work can reasonably be
regarded as involving the street sale of newspapers to the consumer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  However, the solicitation of
newspaper subscriptions for delivery by a person other than the soliciting
employee would not be exempt work under Sec 13(d). The solicitation of
newspaper subscriptions for delivery by other persons (newsboys) does not
constitute work relating to the newsboy’s delivery of newspapers to the
consumer. Nevertheless, the possible application of the Reg 541.5 exemption
should not be overlooked. The work may be permissible under CL Reg 3 provided
it complies with the conditions of that Reg.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23b04 - Collection of insurance premiums from subscribers by carriers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Certain newspapers, as a sales
promotion device, may sell accident and health insurance to their subscribers.
The subscriber makes the initial purchase of the insurance from the newspaper
by mail. The insurance premiums (usually 10¢ a week) are paid by the subscribers
to the carrier who delivers their newspapers at the same time that the carrier
collects for the newspapers. The insurance is sold only to the subscribers of
the newspaper and the carrier collects insurance premiums only from subscribers
to whom he also delivers the newspaper.  Under these circumstances, the
collection of insurance premiums by a carrier as a part of his collection of
the newspaper subscription is an incidental activity to the delivery of the
newspaper and collection therefor, and thus will not defeat the Sec 13(d)
exemption.</p>

<h3>23c00 - General provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 13(a)(l0) provides a MW and OT
exemption for “any switchboard operator employed by an independently owned
public telephone company which has not more than 750 stations”.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23c01 - Independently owned public telephone company.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The unit to which the 750 station test
is applied for purposes of Sec 13(a)(10) is “an independently owned public
telephone company”. The exemption is thus limited to small telephone companies
the ownership of which is independent of the ownership of any other telephone
company. For example, where a telephone company’s stock is owned by another
company the two telephone companies form one independently owned public
telephone company for the purposes of the exemption. Therefore, the exemption
would not apply if the total stations of the two companies exceed 750.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  The phrase “independently owned” as
used in Sec 13(a)(l0) is not synonymous with the phrase “separate company”.
Thus, where several telephone companies are under common ownership, the
exemption will not apply if the total stations serviced by the several
companies exceed 750.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23c02 - Switchboard operator.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   If all other tests are met, the Sec
13(a)(l0) exemption is available only for employees employed in the capacity of
“switchboard operator”. Clerical work in connection with subscribers’ long
distance calls or telegrams, so-called secretarial services performed by the
operator for subscribers through the use of the switchboard itself, the making
of minor repairs, the testing of lines with linemen, the billing of customers,
the collection of bills from customers who call at the exchange, and like work
which is customarily performed by switchboard operators employed by such a
small telephone company comes within the exemption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Whether such other duties as sales
promotion or public relations work, soliciting new business, making bank
deposits, or collecting bills at customers’ homes or business places are exempt
or nonexempt depends upon whether such work is customarily performed as a part
of the duties of a switchboard operator employed by such a small telephone
company. This will generally be determined on the basis of functions
necessarily so performed because the operator is the only representative of the
telephone company available to perform such services, in which event the duties
would be exempt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The exemption is not applicable to
such operators who spend more than 20% of their working time in any workweek in
nonexempt work. (See IB 786, Subpart C.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23c03 - “Station” defined.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The term “station”, as used in Sec
13(a)(l0), means a telephone transmitting and receiving instrument, and includes
extension telephones, and telephones for which switching service is provided.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23c04 - Application of 750 station test.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   In order for the exemption to apply,
the switchboard operators employed by the independently owned public telephone
company may provide operator service for not more than a combined total of 750
stations. Where operators of one company’s exchanges provide direct toll,
information and assistance services to subscribers of a second company’s
exchanges, all the stations of the second company’s exchanges so serviced shall
be added to those of the first company’s exchanges to determine if more than
750 stations are served by the first company.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  Stations of a second company’s
exchange shall not be counted as served by the exchanges of the company being
tested if the operators of the latter merely place calls with or through the
second company’s exchange.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Where a dial is installed in a manual
exchange of the company for the sole purpose of furnishing toll service on
calls between subscribers of the manual exchange and another company’s exchange
which has a dial operation, the stations served by such other company’s dial
exchange shall not be included as stations served by the operators of the
manual exchange of the company being tested for the exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23c05 - Workweek applicability.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Sec 13(a)(l0) exemption applies
on a w/w basis.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23c07 - Telephone-answering and message relaying service.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Sec 13(a)(l0) exemption does not
apply to an employee engaged in operating a telephone switchboard in the office
of a telephone-answering service or other business which does not provide
telephone service to the general public. Nor does the exemption apply to an
employee who uses a telephone in his home to provide a service limited to
answering telephone calls and taking and relaying messages, and who does not operate
a telephone switchboard.</p>

<h3>23d00 - General provisions and IB 793.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 13(b)(9) provides an exemption
from the OT provisions of the FLSA for “any employee employed as an announcer,
news editor, or chief engineer by a radio or television station the major
studio of which is located (A) in a city or town of one hundred thousand
population or less, according to the latest available decennial census figures
as compiled by the Bureau of the Census, except where such city or town is part
of a standard metropolitan statistical area, as defined and designated by the
Office of Management and Budget, which has a total population in excess of one
hundred thousand, or (B) in a city or town of twenty-five thousand population
or less, which is part of such an area but is at least 40 airline miles from the
principal city in such area”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  IB 793 contains the interpretations
by the Adm of the scope and terms of this exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23d01 - Population counts and standard metropolitan statistical areas
(SMSA’s).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) definitions of SMSA’s, and their 1980 populations, are located in FOH Vol
I following Reg 536. The 1980 census figures for the individual States are
located in the AO’s that cover them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  In determining whether the major
studio is located in a city or town or SMSA of 100,000 population or less, as
set forth in test (A), or whether the major studio is located in a city or town
of 25,000 or less, as set forth in test (B), the 1980 U.S. decennial census of
population shall be used for all w/w’s beginning on or after 1/17/82 and the
1970 U.S. decennial census of population shall be used for all w/w’s beginning
prior to 1/17/82.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   In determining whether such city or
town is part of an SMSA, as defined and designated by the OMB as provided in
tests (A) and (B), the list of SMSA’s in FOH Vol I will be used. However, the
determination for the SMSA must be made on the basis of the 1980 figures.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23d02 - Location of major studio outside corporate limits of town or city.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The fact that the major studio of a
small radio or television station is located as much as one mile outside the
corporate limits of the city or town it serves would not of itself preclude
exemption under either clause (A) or clause (B) of Sec 13(b)(9), provided all
other requirements are met. Cases involving greater distances should be
referred through channels to the RS.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23d03 - Cable TV systems.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Unless a particular cable television
system is licensed as a television broadcasting station by the FCC, Sec
13(b)(9) will not apply. (See IB 793.16.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>23d04 - News Editor.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A news editor is defined in IB 793.8
to mean an employee who gathers, edits, and rewrites the news. He or she may
also select and prepare news items for broadcast and present the news on the
air. An employee who is primarily engaged in the above duties and in activities
which are an integral part thereof will be considered to be employed as a news
editor. Thus, where an employee of a qualifying radio or television station
gathers, edits, and rewrites his or her own material, or that of other employees,
without a higher level of review before it is presented on the air, the
employee will qualify for exemption under Sec 13(b)(9). A reporter who is
primarily engaged in the activities discussed above may qualify for exemption
as a news editor.</p>
<h4> </h4>

<h3>23d05 - Chief engineer licensed by the FCC.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Due to changes in FCC licensing
requirements for commercial radio operators, a chief engineer who is otherwise
exempt (see IB 793.9) and holds a commercial radio operator license issued by
the FCC which is valid for AM, FM, or TV broadcasting work will now qualify for
exemption under Sec 13(b)(9) . The exemption now applies to any class of
commercial radio operator unless the license carries an endorsement which does
not authorize operation of AM, FM, or TV broadcast work.</p>

<h3>24a00  General provisions of FLSA Sec 13(b)(1) and IB 782.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   FLSA Sec 13(b)(1) provides that FLSA Sec
7 shall not apply to any employee for whom the Department of Transportation’s
Federal Highway Administration (DOT/FHWA) has power to establish qualifications
and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of Sec 204 of the Motor
Carrier Act of 1935.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   IB 782, together with the instructions
contained in this chapter, form the official WH position with respect to the
application of Sec 13(b)(l).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24a01  Leasing and renting of motor vehicles.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Generally, the Sec 13(b)(1) exemption is
limited to employees of motor carriers (see IB 782.2). However, the Motor
Carrier Act gives the DOT power to establish qualifications and maximum hours
of service for drivers employed by non-carriers in situations where the
non-carrier leases or rents motor vehicles with such drivers to motor carriers.
Thus, where all other tests for exemption are met, Sec 13(b)(1) is applicable
to these drivers while they are driving the motor vehicles leased or rented to
motor carriers, on the same basis as if they were actually employed by the
carriers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Except as provided in (a) above, Sec
13(b)(1) does not extend to other safety-affecting employees of the leasing or
renting establishment, such as mechanics, unless the employer is a motor
carrier in his own right. For example, the employer may conduct his operations
in such a manner as to be a private carrier, or he may lease or rent motor
vehicles to a shipper under such conditions that he maintains control and
direction over the carrier services performed in which case he would be a
contract carrier.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24a02  Effect of ownership of motor vehicles upon status as a motor carrier.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A company may be a motor carrier for the
purposes of the Motor Carrier Act whether it owns, rents, or leases the motor
vehicles it uses.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24a03  FLSA Sec 13(b)(1) not applicable under PCA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>While certain employees may be exempt
under Sec 13(b)(1) from the OT pay requirements of the FLSA, the daily and
weekly OT pay provisions of the PCA are applicable to these employees if they
are subject to the PCA. Likewise, the exemption contained in FLSA Sec 13(b)(1)
has no relationship to PCA Sec 9 which provides a specific exemption under the
PCA for the carriage of freight or personnel by bus or truck where published
tariff rates are in effect.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24a04  Motor carriers of migrant workers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>While DOT/FHWA has authority to establish
certain regulations with respect to carriers of “migrant workers”, the Motor
Carrier Act specifically provides that the exemption under FLSA Sec 13(b)(1)
shall not extend to such carriers solely by virtue of such transportation. A
migrant worker is defined in that law as any individual proceeding to or
returning from employment in agriculture as defined in FLSA Sec 3(f).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24a05  DOT jurisdiction over private carriers limited to carriage of
property.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 203(a)(17) of the Motor Carrier Act
defines the term “private carrier of property by motor vehicle” to mean “any
person not included in the terms ‘common carrier by motor vehicle’ or ‘contract
carrier by motor vehicle’ , who or which transports in interstate or foreign
commerce by motor vehicle property of which such person is the owner, lessee,
or bailee, when such transportation is for the purpose of sale, lease, rent, or
bailment, or in furtherance of any commercial enterprise”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   It should be noted that the DOT
jurisdiction over private carriers is limited to private carriers of
“property”. If the transportation of persons is the primary purpose of a trip
in interstate commerce by a private carrier and any incidental transportation
of property is not significant as a reason for the trip, the transportation
involved would not be within the jurisdiction of the DOT. An employee would not
be considered as engaged in transporting property for purposes of the Motor
Carrier Act because of an arrangement to drive by the post office on his way to
or from work to pick up or deliver his employer’s interstate mail or packages,
whether bulky or not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   If the transportation of property,
regardless of its bulk or weight, is the primary purpose of an interstate trip
by a private carrier, or if the transportation of such property is a distinct
and definite reason for the trip along with the transportation of persons, the
transportation is within the jurisdiction of the DOT. This principle would
apply, for example, where property such as an automobile or a truck is driven to
another State not simply as a means of transportation for the driver or
passengers but because the movement of the vehicle itself is a distinct purpose
of the trip. Likewise, this principle applies where self-propelled machines
such as bulldozers and cranes are driven over the public highways as part of a
journey in which such vehicles are moved from one State to another.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   The fact that an employee of a private
carrier may use his own vehicle in transporting property in interstate commerce
does not deny an otherwise applicable exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24a06  Freight forwarders who are not carriers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The FLSA Sec 13(b)(1) exemption does not
apply to the loading and checking employees of an interstate freight forwarder
who does not own, lease, or rent trucks, but contracts for transportation of
the goods with a carrier. Such a freight forwarder is not a motor carrier
within the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24a07  Transportation of explosives and other dangerous articles.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The DOT (FHWA) has power to regulate the intrastate,
as well as interstate and foreign shipment of explosives and other dangerous
articles (such as corrosive acids, flammable liquids, radioactive materials,
etc.) under the Explosives and Other Dangerous Articles Act. However, the Motor
Carrier Act and the Explosives and Other Dangerous Articles Act are completely
separate pieces of legislation. Consequently, the fact that the Federal Highway
Administration asserts jurisdiction under the Explosives and Other Dangerous
Articles Act over employees engaged in such transportation has no bearing on
their status under Sec 13(b)(l). The exempt or nonexempt status of such
employees under Sec 13(b)(1) shall be determined in the normal manner.</p>

<h3>24b00  “Spotting” trucks, tractors, trailers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The movement of trucks, tractors, or
trailers (either empty or loaded) over the public highways between loading
platforms, the garage, storage facilities or terminals, where such movement is
either the beginning or continuation of an interstate or foreign journey, is
itself transportation in interstate or foreign commerce subject to the
jurisdiction of the DOT. If such “spotting” of equipment takes place entirely
on the premises of a terminal or other private property, however, DOT would
have no jurisdiction since it would not be transportation over the public
highways.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24b01  Mechanics.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Activities of mechanics which directly
affect safety of operation of motor vehicles are described in IB 782.6(a).
Activities which do not affect the safety of operation and do not, therefore,
afford a basis for exemption are described in IB 782.6(c).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   If a mechanic actually exercises
discretion or responsibility with regard to the proper mechanical repair of
motor vehicles for their safe operation in interstate commerce on the highways,
the mere fact that his work is subject to supervision or approval by the
foreman would not withdraw the otherwise applicable exemption from him. Likewise,
an employee who inspects and tests motor vehicles to see that they are in a
safe operating condition is performing safety-affecting work even though he may
not himself make the repairs.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24b02  Refrigeration mechanics.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The DOT has determined that the installation,
inspection, repair, and maintenance of refrigeration equipment on motor
vehicles operated in interstate commerce are safety-affecting activities
subject to DOT jurisdiction under Sec 204 of the Motor Carrier Act.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24b03  Bus line hostesses.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Certain interstate passenger carriers
operate motor buses with “hostesses” who have such duties as looking after the
comfort of the passengers, keeping the aisles clean and clear, and assisting
the driver and passengers in case of accident or vehicle failure. For purposes
of applying Sec 13(b)(l), these hostesses are classified as “helpers” and their
duties are considered to affect the safety of operation of the vehicle. (See IB
782.4, Footnote 44.)</p>

<h3>24c00  Interstate transportation under the Motor Carrier Act.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The definitions of “interstate commerce”
contained in the Motor Carrier Act and the FLSA are not identical. Consequently,
transportation by motor vehicle which is in “interstate commerce” under FLSA
may not constitute transportation over which DOT has the power to exercise
control and upon which the Sec 13(b)(1) exemption could be based. In applying
the exemption, however, and for enforcement purposes only, WH will consider
that a movement in interstate commerce for purposes of FLSA is also a movement
in interstate commerce for purposes of the Motor Carrier Act, except where DOT
or the courts hold otherwise. (See IB 782.7(b) and FOH 24d02.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   If transportation which is considered
intrastate under the FLSA is performed under operating authority granted by the
DOT after a hearing and finding that it will accept jurisdiction under the
Motor Carrier Act, it is the policy of WH to recognize this decision in
applying Sec 13(b)(l).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24c01  Transportation in “foreign commerce” or within a territory or
possession.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   For purposes of the application of Sec
13(b)(1), the term “foreign commerce” means commerce, whether such commerce moves
wholly by motor vehicle or partly by motor vehicle and partly by rail, express,
or water:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Between any place in
the United States and any place in a foreign country, or between places in the
United States through a foreign country; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Between any place in
the United States and any place in a Territory or possession of the United
States, insofar as such transportation takes place within the United States; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Between places in a
foreign country, or between a place in one foreign country and a place in
another foreign country, insofar as such trans­portation takes place within the
United States.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Transportation within a Territory or
possession of the United States is nonexempt since such transportation is not
included in the definition of interstate or foreign commerce under the Motor
Carrier Act.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24c02  Processing or packaging in transit.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   In most cases the transportation of goods
from a point of origin within a State to a processing or manufacturing
establishment in the same State is not exempt under Sec 13(b)(1) because an
actual out-of-State movement of the goods does not begin until the processing
or manufacturing has taken place. (See IB 782.7(c).) In the usual situation
there are two separate and distinct movements of the goods under the Motor Carrier
Act, the one before processing being in “intrastate” commerce and the one after
proces­sing being in “interstate or foreign” commerce. There are certain
situations, however, where processing or packaging operations are performed on
goods during the course of their movement to a specified out-of-State
destination under such circumstances that the exemption may be applied to the
transportation preceding the operations as well as to that which follows. Such
transportation is viewed as a single movement for purposes of the Motor Carrier
Act and FLSA Sec 13(b)(1) where the practical continuity of the journey from
the point of origin within the State to the intended out-of-State destination
has not been broken. The following examples illustrate this principle:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Coal being shipped to
an out-of-State buyer is hauled to a tipple where, in a continuous operation,
it is unloaded from the truck and cleaned, crushed, or graded and loaded
directly into railroad cars for shipment out-of-State; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Household goods are transported
by truck from a home to a warehouse to be crated or packed so that the movement
by motor vehicle to the intended out-of-State destination may be continued.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24c03  Vending machine servicemen.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Vending machine servicemen who transport
products between a warehouse and points within the same State, where such
products have been procured from other States for stocking vending machines,
are engaged in the transportation of property in interstate commerce until
placed in the vending machines (see FOH 11v00). Thus, no assertion will be made
that Sec 13(b)(1) does not apply in such situations.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24c04  Drivers of buses and limousines operating to and from transportation
terminals.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Drivers of buses/shuttle
services/limousines carrying interstate passengers and their baggage to and
from transportation terminals within a single state are not engaged in
interstate transportation of passengers and property within the meaning of the
Motor Carrier Act, unless the transportation is part of a through-ticketing or
other common arrangement between the motor carrier and the air carrier.
Therefore, Sec 13(b)(l) will not apply except in the case of a
through-ticketing or other common arrangement for continuous passage or
interchange between the motor carrier and the air carrier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An example would be where there is a
through-ticketing arrangement under which passengers purchase a single ticket
which is good for both the local bus ride and the prior or subsequent
interstate journey by air, rail, or bus.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24c05  Transportation of consumable goods (fuel, food, supplies) to
railroads, docks, and airports.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Under the Motor Carrier Act, the movement
of “consumable goods,” such as food and drink, ice, coal, and gasoline (see IB
782.8(a)), terminates upon delivery to railroads, ship docks, airports or other
similar points. Thus, such transportation is not in interstate or foreign
commerce so as to be within the jurisdiction of the DOT except where the
transportation is an integral part of a single movement which commenced outside
the State in which delivery is made.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24c06  Combination interstate and intrastate transportation.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   If it is known that some portion of a
particular load is moving in interstate commerce, whether or not this is an
identifiable portion of the load, the trip will be viewed as an interstate trip
and therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the DOT.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   If a driver employed by a manufacturer
makes a trip by motor vehicle from the plant to a railhead or other
transportation terminal to pick up or deliver goods moving in interstate
commerce, the transportation is subject to the jurisdiction of the DOT
regardless of the fact that the employee may make stops along the way in
connection with production activities.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24c08  Ambulance and hearse transportation.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   It is the position of WH that the Department
of Transportation (DOT) has no jurisdiction over the operation of ambulances
and hearses within the meaning of the FLSA Sec 13(b)(1) motor carrier
exemption, and that the exemption does not apply to employees so engaged. This
position is derived from court and administrative decisions and a statement by
DOT disclaiming jurisdiction over ambulances. Spires v. Ben Hill County, 980
F.2d 683 (11th Cir. 1993); Jones v. Giles, 741 F.2d 245 (9th Cir. 1984); Lonnie
W. Dennis. Common Carrier Application 63 M.C.C. 66 (1954); 42 Federal Register
60,078, 60,080 (November 23, 1977).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The Eleventh Circuit (Spires) recently
joined the Ninth Circuit (Jones) in holding that ambulance drivers are not
subject to FLSA Sec 13(b)(l). Both courts noted that the Interstate Commerce
Commission (ICC) (DOT predecessor) had determined that the unique operation of
ambulances compared to other forms of motor transportation put them outside the
ICC’s jurisdiction. The only decision specifically contrary is Benson v.
Universal Ambulance Service. Inc., 675 F.2d 783 (6th Cir. 1982), a decision
which did not deal with the ICC ruling, and both the Ninth and Eleventh
Circuits specifically declined to follow Benson. (See also FOH 52p07.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24c09  Contractual hauling of debris and rubble.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>WH will not deny the Sec 13(b)(1)
exemption with respect to employees engaged in transportation of garbage,
refuse, and trash, including rock debris and like commodities obtained from
excavations and the demolition of buildings, who would otherwise be considered
exempt except for the disclaimer of jurisdiction over such transportation by
the DOT.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24c10  Transportation of checks drawn on out-of-State banks.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   In the usual operation of an armored car
company the vehicles transport checks drawn on out-of-State banks as well as
coins and currency to a bank for subsequent out-of-State transmittal. The
transportation to the main bank for further transmittal is part of a “practical
continuity of movement” across State lines, making the Sec 13(b)(1) exemption
applicable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   On the other hand, there is a significant
difference with respect to route salespersons who pick up checks from their
customers and turn them in to the office before they continue on to the bank
for subsequent out-of-State transmittal. Such checks must be credited on the
firm’s books, endorsed, and otherwise “processed” before depositing. Such
processing in the office is sufficient to constitute a break in the interstate
movement, and Sec 13 (b)(l) would not be applicable.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24c11  Acquisition of interstate business.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   A common carrier that holds itself out in
good faith for interstate business, pursuant to a valid ICC certificate, is
subject to DOT’s jurisdiction under Sec 204 of the Motor Carrier Act.
Therefore, drivers, driver’s helpers, loaders, and mechanics employed by such
carriers may be exempt under Sec 13(b)(1) even though the carrier may never
actually acquire any interstate business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Thus, the exemption is applicable to such
employees notwithstanding the implication in IB 782.2(c) that there should be
an expectation of a small percentage of interstate work.</p>

<h3>24d00  Drivers delivering newspapers within the State.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The delivery of newspapers within the
State in which they are printed is not transportation over which the DOT has
jurisdiction. While such delivery drivers are engaged in the interstate
communication or transmission of news so as to be covered by the FLSA, they are
not transporting property (the newspaper) in interstate or foreign commerce
within the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Certain newspapers of the type described
in (a) above contain as an integral part weekly supplements, such as comics,
magazines and the like, which are produced outside the State. If these
supplements are obtained by the news­paper in complete and finished form and no
processing work is performed on them by the newspaper establishment, the
movement within the State of the supplements printed out of State constitutes
part of a practical continuity of movement of the goods from the point of
origin to the ultimate destina­tion. Thus, the Sec 13(b)(1) exemption is
applicable to the delivery drivers who transport and deliver the newspaper
containing the supplements. The temporary storage of the supplements at the
newspaper establishment awaiting insertion into the paper does not change the
interstate character of the transportation.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24d01  “Off-highway” transportation.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Drivers engaged in transportation solely
on private property do not come within the Sec 13(b)(1) exemption since such
transportation is not “over the public highways.” The fact that a State line or
a public highway is crossed during the course of such transportation would not
change this conclusion.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24d02  Transportation of commodities from terminal storage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   IB 782.7(b)(1) contains an enforcement
policy with respect to motor carrier transportation of property or passengers
within a single State which provides that any such movement which is in
interstate commerce under the FLSA will be considered a movement in interstate
commerce under the Motor Carrier Act (Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act)
except where the DOT or the courts hold otherwise. However, as stated in IB
782.7(b)(2), the DOT has held that transportation confined to points in a
single State from a storage terminal of commodities which have had a prior
movement by rail, pipeline, motor, or water from an origin in a different State
is not in interstate commerce within the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act if the
shipper has no fixed and persisting transportation intent beyond the terminal
storage point at the time of the shipment. It has been specifically found that
there is no fixed and persisting intent where the following three conditions
are present:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
At the time of
shipment there is no specific order being filled for a specific quantity of a
given product to be moved through to a specific destination;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The terminal storage
is a distribution point or local marketing facility from which specific amounts
of the product are sold or allocated; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Transportation in the
furtherance of this distribution within the single State is specifically
arranged only after sale or allocation from storage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
term “fixed and persisting transportation intent” as used by the DOT refers to
the intent of the shipper of the commodities into the State, who may or may not
also be the importer. If in applying the tests set out in (1) through (3) above
it is determined that there was no such intent on the part of the shipper, the
interstate movement of the commod­ities under the Motor Carrier Act ends with
delivery to a terminal storage facility even where a “practical continuity of
movement” through the terminal (Jacksonville Paper rule) makes the subsequent
movement of all or part of the commodities from terminal storage to a
destination in the same State a part of their movement in interstate commerce
under the FLSA. Thus, in situations where the three tests are in fact met, as
has been found to be true with respect to movement of petroleum products
through pipeline and water terminals, such a subsequent movement would be
considered a separate intrastate movement under the Motor Carrier Act even
though the importer ordered the out-of-State goods in anticipation of the needs
of a stable group of specified customers, or to meet the needs of particular
customers pursuant to an understanding with them, or to fill previously
received orders of his customers. However, these facts which demonstrate a
“practical continuity of movement” under FLSA may, in par­ticular cases, also demonstrate
that one or more of the three DOT condi­tions are not met, and must be
carefully examined with this in mind in any situation in which the application
of the tests to the facts present in such situation has not specifically been
determined by the DOT.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   In some situations the shipper is also
the importer, as would be the case where a manufacturer, such as a bakery,
produces goods in one State and moves them through his distribution point in
another State to his cus­tomers in that State. The employer, as the shipper,
knows at the time of the shipment what he intends to do with the goods after
they reach his out-of-State distribution point. If, as would normally be the
case, there is a “practical continuity of movement” of the out-of-State goods
through the firm’s distribution point to its customers, this is sufficient to
establish a “fixed and persisting transportation intent” beyond the
distribution point for purposes of applying Sec 13(b)(1).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Transportation within a single State of
petroleum products from pipeline or water terminals, as ordinarily performed,
has specifically been held by the DOT to be in intrastate rather than
interstate commerce within the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act. Employees
engaged in such transporta­tion, if covered on traditional or enterprise
grounds under FLSA, are not within the Sec 13(b)(l) exemption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Transportation within a single State from
a chain store warehouse to outlets of the chain, of goods brought into the
State for sale at the outlets, is covered on traditional “in commerce” grounds
under the FLSA and is also transportation in interstate commerce under the
Motor Carrier Act. The Sec 13(b)(l) exemption applies to the drivers, drivers’
helpers, loaders and mechanics concerned with such transportation. This has
been established in the courts and the DOT determination in paragraph (a) above
has no application. The situation of the chain store warehouse differs in
essential respects from that of the terminals considered by the DOT in its
decision. As the courts have uniformly held, the situation in the chain store
cases is one where goods are shipped from one State and briefly ware­housed in
another for the convenience of the owner in making an efficient distribution of
those goods to its local retail outlets. All goods ordered from other States
for delivery to the warehouse are ordered to supply the needs of the retail
stores, and the shipper will know or can be presumed to know that these stores
are the ultimate destination of the goods shipped. Transportation of goods from
the warehouse to the retail outlets is typically scheduled for the most part on
a continuing basis, rather than only after specific items have been sold or
allocated from storage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Transportation within a single State from
the warehouse of an independent wholesaler or supplier of goods ordered from
other States to meet the needs of an associated or allied group of retail
stores may be assumed to be in interstate commerce within the meaning of the
Motor Carrier Act for purposes of Sec 13(b)(l) pending further clarification by
DOT or the courts, if the warehouse serves such stores exclusively and the
situation is in other res­pects comparable to the chain store situation
discussed in paragraph (c) above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   In situations other than those in (b),
(c), (d), and (e) above, the CO shall make every effort to determine the “fixed
and persisting transportation intent” of the shipper by ascertaining from the
information available at the establishment under investigation whether the
three DOT tests are met. In the case of the typical wholesaler or supplier this
will generally present no problem because the facts will be available to show
whether tests (2) and (3) in (a) above are met and the presence or absence of
any transportation intent beyond the importer’s establishment on the part of
the shipper can ordinarily be demonstrated from the importer’s purchase orders,
invoices, and other similar records. In the event the CO is unable to resolve
the question from information available at the establishment under investigation,
he shall make no attempt to contact the shipper. In such situations the matter
shall be referred promptly to the AD and the ARA shall be contacted as
necessary for additional guidance or to consult the RS as appropriate.</p>

<h3>24e00  Requirements for exemption in general.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>IB 782.2 sets forth the bases on which
the exemption is applied to employees of common, contract, and private carriers.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24e01  Extent of DOT jurisdiction.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   DOT has held that drivers, driver’s
helpers, loaders, and mechanics engaged in activities which directly affect the
safe operation of motor vehicles in interstate commerce will be subject to its
jurisdiction under Sec 204 of the Motor Carrier Act. This applies to such
employees who are employed by a common, contract, or private carrier which has
engaged in the interstate transportation of goods. In the case of a common
carrier that has solicited interstate transportation business pursuant to a
valid I.C.C. certificate, it would not be necessary to have actually engaged in
the interstate transportation of goods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Where a driver or driver’s helper has not
made an actual interstate trip, or a loader or mechanic has not been working on
an interstate shipment or vehicle which has been utilized in such a shipment,
they may still be subject to DOT’s jurisdiction, if:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
The carrier is shown
to have an involvement in interstate commerce and,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
It can be established
that the driver or driver’s helper could have, in the regular course of his/her
employment, been reasonably expected to make one of the carrier’s interstate
runs or, in the case of a loader or mechanic, could have been reasonably
expected to perform as such in the carrier’s interstate activity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Satisfactory
evidence of the above could take the form of statements from the carrier’s
employees, or documentation such as employment agreements. Where such evidence
is developed with regard to an employee, DOT will assert jurisdiction over that
employee for a 4-month period beginning with the date they could have been
called upon to, or actually did, engage in the carrier’s interstate activity.
Thus, such employees would be exempt under Sec 13(b)(l) for the same 4-month period,
notwithstanding references to the contrary contained in IB 782.2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Where it is not clear whether this
exemption will apply to a carrier’s drivers, driver’s helpers, loaders, and
mechanics, the following information should be developed and forwarded to the
AA/OFLS:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
With regard to the
carrier:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     The extent to which it is involved in
interstate commerce;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
b.     Evidence, in the case of a common carrier
which has not engaged in interstate transportation, that it has solicited such
business; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     Whether it operates pursuant to a valid
ICC certificate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
With regard to the
employees in question:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     The degree to which their duties affect
the safety of operation of motor vehicles on the public highways in interstate
commerce;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
b.     The frequency with which they engage in
the duties of a driver, driver’s helper, loader, or mechanic in an interstate
activity; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     Evidence that they could be called upon
to perform the duties of a driver, driver’s helper, loader, or mechanic in an
interstate activity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Any other pertinent
information regarding the exempt status of the carrier’s employees.</p>

<h3>24f00   General provisions of FLSA Sec 13(b)(11).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 13(b)(11) provides that FLSA Sec 7
shall not apply to “any employee employed as a driver or driver’s helper making
local deliveries, who is compensated for such employment on the basis of trip
rates, or other delivery payment plan, if the Secretary shall find that such plan
has the general purpose and effect of reducing hours worked by such employees
to, or below, the maximum workweek applicable to them under Sec 7(a)”.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24f01   Approval of Sec 13(b)(11) payment plans.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Reg 551 sets out the requirements and
procedures for submission of petitions to the Adm for approval of plans to
operate under this OT exemption. Reg 516.15 provides for certain records to be
kept by employers operating under an approved plan. Employers desiring to make
use of the Sec 13(b)(11) exemption should be furnished a copy of Reg 551 and
advised of the necessity to secure prior approval of such plans.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24f02   Plans approved prior to issuance of Reg 551.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Adm has approved a small number of
plans submitted to him prior to the issuance of Reg 551. Should an employer
claim this exemption based on such approval, the facts shall be obtained as to
whether the plan operates to meet the requirements as set out in Reg 551. If
there is any question as to whether the operation of the plan is consistent
with Reg 551, the matter shall be referred through channels to the AA for OFLS
without further action.</p>

<h3>24g00  General considerations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec l3(b)(7) of the amended Act,
effective 5/1/74, provides a partial OT exemption as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Any driver, operator, or conductor
employed by an employer engaged in the business of operating a street, suburban
or interurban electric railway, or local trolley or motorbus carrier
(regardless of whether or not such railway carrier is public or private or
operated for profit or not for profit), if such employee receives compensation
for employment in excess of forty-eight hours in any workweek at a rate not
less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(NOTE: Effective 5/1/75, OT compensation
must be paid for hours worked in excess of 44 per week; and effective 5/1/76,
the exemption is repealed and thus OT compensation must be paid for hours
worked in excess of 40 per week.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Sec 7(n) of the amended Act provides that
in determining the hours of employment of an employee of a transit system or
carrier, the hours worked in “charter activities” shall not be included if</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
the employee’s
employment in such activities was pursuant to an agreement or understanding
with his employer arrived at before engaging in such employment, and </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
employment in such
activities is not part of such employee’s regular employment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   An employer cannot satisfy his
obligations under the Act by the unilateral adoption of the provision in Sec
7(n). Sec 7(n) is operable only if pursuant to an agreement or understanding
arrived at between the employer and the employee before performance of the
work. If the employees express their unwillingness to accept the exclusion of
hours spent in charter activities from the number of hours worked, Sec 7(n) is
inapplicable.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24g01  General considerations, 1966 Amendments (2/1/67 - 4/30/74).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   During the period 2/l/67 to 4/30/74, Sec
l3(b)(7) provided an OT exemption for:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“any driver, operator, or conductor
employed by an employer engaged in the business of operating a street, suburban
or interurban electric railway, or local trolley or motorbus carrier, if the
rates and services of such railway or carrier are subject to regulation by a
State or local agency.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The OT exemption in Sec l3(b)(7) in the
period 2/1/67 - 4/30/74 for any driver, operator, or conductor applied in all
cases where the State or political subdivision thereof was the “employer”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   With respect to a publicly-owned railway
or carrier, it will be assumed for purposes of former Sec l3(b)(7) that such
public ownership carries with it the regulation of rates and services . With
respect to such a railway or carrier which is privately owned, the rates and
services are normally regulated by the State or by a local agency. However,
this is a question of fact and must be determined on the circumstances in each
case.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24g02  General considerations - Sec 13(a)(9) of the Act, prior to 1966
Amendments.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 13(a)(9) of the Act, prior to 2/1/67,
provided that the MW and OT requirements of the FLSA would not apply to “any
employee of a street, suburban or interurban electric railway, or local trolley
or motor bus carrier, not in an enterprise described in Section 3(s)(2)”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   It should be noted that the MW and OT
exemption provided by Sec 13(a)(9) as amended in 1961, was available only for
employment which was not in an enterprise described in old Sec 3(s)(2). 1/ </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24g03  Applicable MW rates and OT standards effective 5/1/74.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employment by a private employer engaged
in the business of operating a street, suburban or interurban electric railway,
or local trolley or motorbus carrier is subject to MW and OT standards as
follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
MW standard. The MW
standard provided by Sec 6(a)(l) applies if the employment is in an enterprise
described in 1961 Sec 3(s)(2) or is in non-carrier activities; otherwise the MW
standard provided by Sec 6(b) applies. (Old Sec 3(s)(2). Local transit
enterprises having an annual gross volume of sales of at least $1 million
(exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level which are separately stated).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
OT standard. An
employee (not otherwise exempt) must be paid OT for hours worked in excess of
40 per w/w; any driver, operator, or conductor not otherwise exempt must be
paid OT for hours worked in excess of 48 in the w/w (44 hours, effective
5/1/75; and 40 hours, effective 5/1/76). (See also FOH 24g00(b).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   If a State or political subdivision
thereof is the “employer”, employees engaged in performing activities connected
with the operation of the described railway or carrier are subject to MW and OT
standards as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
The MW standard
provided by Sec 6(b) applies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The OT standard is
the same as for private employees (see FOH 24g03(a)(2) above).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24g05  “Of a street, suburban or interurban electric railway”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The phrase “of a street, suburban or
interurban electric railway” refers to the various types of streetcar or
electric railway service used in city, suburban, or interurban transportation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The term “interurban electric railway”
does not include railways which carry freight only and do not carry passengers.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24g06  “Trolley or motorbus”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The term “trolley or motorbus” refers to
the type of buses operated by electrical power derived from fixed overhead
wires as well as to the ordinary gasoline or diesel power motorbus used in
furnishing local passenger transportation similar to street railway service.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24g07  “Local”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The word “local” modifies only the words
“trolley or motorbus”. The indispensable characteristic of a local motorbus
carrier is that it is a carrier which serves an integrated commercial or industrial
area for the purposes of carrying persons to and from their work in offices and
factories, children to and from school daily, and other persons attending to
necessary routine business. If a carrier does not meet this test, it is not
exempt. On the other hand, the mere serving, as above, of an integrated
commercial area by a carrier would not conclusively establish the fact that
such a carrier is local unless it has generally the following characteristics,
the first three of which are the most significant:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
The fare on a local
bus route is either paid to the driver directly or deposited in a coin box.
Tickets are not sold at terminals or other designated places for single trips.
School tickets, weekly passes, or commutation tickets are in some instances,
however, used on local carriers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
The fare on a local
bus route is either a single fare for the entire route, or is based on the
number of zones through which a person travels. The fare is not based on the
number of miles traveled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Buses of a local
carrier traverse the same route at frequent intervals, usually with a “headway”
of less than 1 hour, and make frequent stops at designated places, ordinarily
spaced at a given number of feet. These operating schedules are generally
speeded up during the morning and evening peak periods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
The buses used on
local routes differ from the over-the-road buses in that the seats in the
former are more narrowly spaced and the aisle is wider to accommodate standees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5) 
Local buses are built
not to exceed a speed of approximately 45 miles per hour, while the top speed
of the over-the-road bus is much higher.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6) 
Local buses are
geared for the quick acceleration necessary for short runs in congested
traffic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7) 
Local buses do not
maintain space for baggage, having at best a package rack for small items such
as lunch boxes and packaged merchandise. Over-the-road buses have space set
aside in the rear, on the roof, or within the bus for the luggage commonly
required in traveling considerable distances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8) 
Drivers of local
buses are ordinarily paid on an hourly rather than a mileage basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9) 
Drivers of local
buses do not make runs which prevent them from returning home each day after
work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(10) 
Local bus carriers do
not maintain schedules designed to make connections with over-the-road
carriers, nor are they engaged in carriage which is a continuation of
over-the-road travel, preliminary thereto, or a part thereof.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(11) 
The statistical
pattern of national over-the-road travel indicates a falling off of business
during the fall, winter, and early spring months with a sharp increase during
the late spring months and summer traceable to pleasure trips taken during
vacation periods. The statistical pattern for local bus travel depicts a low
degree of travel during the late spring months and summer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The crossing of State lines does not of
itself change the local character of a carrier if the tests set out in (a)
above are met.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24g08  Sec l3(b)(7) exemption not defeated by minor discrepancies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>While FOH 24g07 sets forth the principal
characteristics of a local trolley or motorbus carrier, as those terms are
used, minor dis­crepancies will not defeat the Sec l3(b)(7) exemption (nor did
they defeat the exemptions provided by old Sec l3(b)(7) or old Sec 13 (a)(9)).
Since no hard and fast rule is possible, a determination will depend upon an
appraisal of all the facts.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24g09  Local operations that are not within the exemptions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Certain operations, although local in
character, do not fall within the new Sec l3(b)(7) (or old Sec l3(b)(7) or old
Sec 13 (a)(9)) exemption, which was intended to include only those trolley or
motorbus carriers rendering daily common passenger service as part of the
transportation system of the locality. Thus, motorbus carriers engaged in
contractual hauling of goods or persons are not within the exemption since
these services are not rendered to the public at large as part of the available
transportation facilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Those employees who perform the
contractual hauling activities of a motorbus carrier, whether such hauling be
of persons or property, are performing nonexempt work under Sec l3(b)(7) (and
were performing nonexempt work under old Sec l3(b)(7) and old Sec 13(a)(9)).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24g10  Tolerance for nonexempt work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In applying Sec l3(b)(7) (or old Sec
l3(b)(7) or old Sec 13(a)(9)) the exemption shall be deemed applicable even
though some nonexempt work is performed by the employee during the w/w, unless
the amount of such nonexempt work is substantial. The amount of nonexempt work
will be considered substantial if it occupies more than 20% of the time worked
by the employee during the w/w. (See IB 786.50.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24g11  Charter activities excludable under Sec 7(n).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Charter activities which meet the
statutory tests of Sec 7(n) are excluded from “hours worked” for OT purposes (see
also FOH 24g00(b) and (c)). Thus, only the time spent in charter activities
which begins outside the employee’s ordinary workday or w/w is excludable under
7(n). Where such a charter is of such duration that it carries over to the next
workday or w/w, such work continues to be excludable provided the employee is
relieved from duty at the conclusion of the charter until the next workday begins.
Any charter activity performed in a regular workday or w/w (i.e., which begins
in any part of the regular workday or w/w), must be included in “hours worked”
for OT purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The fact that a transit system regularly
engages in charter work does not preclude the use of Sec 7(n). The term
“regular” as used in Sec 7(n) relates to the employee’s activities, not the
employer’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Sums paid for charter activities would be
excluded from the “regular rate” if such activities are excluded from “hours
worked” pursuant to Subsec (a) above.</p>

<h3>24h00  General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec l3(b)(l7) provides an OT exemption as
follows: “any driver employed by an employer engaged in the business of
operating taxicabs”.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24h01  “Business of operating taxicabs”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The taxicab business consists normally of
common carrier transportation in small motor vehicles of persons and such
property as they may carry with them to any requested destination in the
community. The business operates without fixed routes or contracts for
recurrent transportation. It serves the miscellaneous and predominantly local
transportation needs of the community. It may include such occasional and
unscheduled trips to or from transportation terminals as the individual
passengers may request, and may include stands at the transportation terminals
as well as at other places where numerous demands for taxicab transportation
may be expected.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24h02  Exemption limited to drivers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The OT exemption contained in Sec
13(b)(l7) applies to “any driver” employed by an employer engaged in the
business of operating taxicabs. The exemption is thus limited to drivers only.
(For discussion of nonexempt work, see FOH 24h03.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24h03  Examples of nonexempt work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Examples of nonexempt work by “any
driver” for purposes of Sec l3(b)(l7) are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Acting as a
dispatcher.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Performing general
clerical duties (making reports in connection with his own driving operations
is within the exemption).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Performing general
mechanical or repair services on vehicles (cleaning, washing, or making
incidental minor repairs on the vehicle assigned to him as a driver are within
the exemption).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
Performing work,
including driving, in connection with other business operations of the employer
(i.e., not his taxicab operations), such as operation of an airport limousine
service (see FOH 24c04), a pick-up and delivery service, or a moving and
storage service.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24h04  Tolerance for nonexempt work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In applying Sec l3(b)(l7) the exemption
shall be deemed applicable even though some nonexempt work is performed by the
employee during the workweek, unless the amount of such nonexempt work is
substantial. The amount of nonexempt work will be considered substantial if it
occupies more than 20% of the time worked by the employee during the workweek.
(See IB 786.200)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24h05  Possible application the Sec 13(b)(l) exemption.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If for any reason, taxicab drivers are
not exempt from the OT requirements of the Act under Sec 13(b)(17), the
possible application of Sec 13(b)(l) should not be overlooked. (See FOH 24c04
and 24e).</p>

<h3>24h06  MW rate considerations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Old Sec 13(a)(12), prior to 2/l/67,
provided a MW and OT exemption for “any employee of an employer engaged in the
business of operating taxicabs”. Since the old Sec 13(a)(12) exemption extended
to all employees whose work is performed in connection with the employer’s
taxicab business, it would include drivers, dispatchers, office workers,
mechanics, etc. Employment which became subject to the MW provisions by virtue
of the repeal of old Sec 13(a)(12) is subject to the Sec 6(b) rate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Tolerance for nonexempt work. Nonexempt
work, for purposes of old Sec 13(a)(12), is work which is not normally
considered a part of the taxicab business . However, for enforcement purposes,
the exemption shall be deemed applicable even though some nonexempt work is per­formed
by a particular employee during the w/w, unless the amount of such nonexempt
work is substantial. The amount of nonexempt work will be considered
substantial if it occupies more than 20% of the time worked by the employee
during the w/w. (See IB 786, Subpart E.) Examples of nonexempt work include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
the transfer of
baggage or freight which is not performed in conjunction with and as an
incident to the transportation of persons in the same vehicle;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
work performed in
connection with garage and repair services on vehicles other than those used in
the employer’s taxicab business; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
work performed in
connection with other business operations of the employer (i.e. not his taxicab
operations) such as the operation of an airport limousine service (see FOH
24c04), a pick-up and delivery service, or a moving and storage service. (See
FOH 24h03.)</p>

<h3>24i00   General provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 13(b)(2) of the amended Act,
effective 5/1/74, provides an exemption from the OT provisions of the FLSA for
“any employee of an employer engaged in the operation of a common carrier by
rail and subject to the provisions of Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   For the period 2/1/67 - 5/1/74, Sec
13(b)(2) provided an OT exemption for “any employee of an employer subject to
the provisions of Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   As indicated above, the OT exemption for
employees of oil pipeline transportation companies was repealed by the 1974
Amendments. Therefore, such employees must be paid OT compensation after 40
hours per week, effective 5/1/74.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24i01   Scope of the FLSA Sec 13(b)(2) exemption.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The provisions of Part I of the Interstate
Commerce Act apply only to common carriers engaged in interstate commerce in
the transportation of passengers or property wholly by railroad, or partly by
railroad and partly by water when both are under common control, management, or
arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment. Employers in this category
include railroad carriers, express companies, sleeping car companies, and
refrigerator car companies. (Prior to 5/1/74, the exemption also applied to
employees of common carriers engaged in interstate commerce by pipeline (except
carriers of water or of natural or artificial gas).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   In the foregoing paragraph, the words
“common control, management, or arrangement” may include a common understanding
between carriers as to traffic policy, even though the separate corporate
entities of the carriers may be maintained.  For example, a car ferry company
which maintains its own carriage distinct and independent by having separate
contracts, independent rates, and receiving direct instructions from the
shippers concerning carriage by it, is not under common control, management, or
arrangement with another carrier. If, however, the transportation by a railroad
and such a ferry company is covered by a through bill of lading, or by through
rates or charges, or if there is any other arrangement indicating a common
traffic policy by the two companies, the ferry company may be an employer
subject to Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The exemption applies only to those
employees who perform activities which subject their employer to Part I of the
Interstate Commerce Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   The term “employer”, as used in the
exemption, refers to the person or persons who would be legally obligated to
pay OT wages, if not specifically exempted therefrom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Employees of an employer who leases
refrigerator and tank cars to railroads and shippers for the interstate
transportation of goods are exempt from the requirements of the FLSA under Sec
13(b)(2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Employees of an independent railroad
contractor engaged in laying and grading track and other maintenance of way
operations are not within the Sec 13(b)(2) exemption, even though the railroad
exercises jurisdiction over the manner in which the work is performed and gives
written approval for the wages and OT paid employees by the independent
contractor. The contractor, being engaged in construction work for a railroad,
is not an employer subject to Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Employees of a railroad contractor,
engaged in maintaining and servicing air-conditioning and car-lighting
equipment sold to railroads, are not within the Sec 13(b)(2) exemption since
the contractor is neither a common carrier nor engaged in transportation in
interstate commerce. The fact that a railroad contractor may be subject to the
Railroad Retirement Act or the Railway Labor Act is not a criterion for
determining the application of the Sec 13 (b)(2) exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24i02   Operations included within the FLSA Sec 13(b)(2) exemption.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees of a railroad company
manufacturing ice are within the Sec 13(b)(2) exemption where the ice is made
solely for use by the railroad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The loading and unloading of livestock by
employees of a public stockyard onto and from railroad cars is within the Sec
13(b)(2) exemption, but other stockyard activities, such as the yarding,
feeding, watering, and handling of livestock before or after the loading or
unloading operations, are not within the exemption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   For purposes of the old Sec l3(b)(2)
exemption during the period prior to 5/1/74, employees of a carrier engaged in
the transportation of oil by pipeline within a State as part of an interstate
system of transportation (or connecting with such a transportation system),
uninterrupted by processing, were within Sec l3(b)(2) because such activities
are subject to regulation under Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act. This was
true even though a firm was transporting only its own products in its own
pipeline or gathering system since the term “common carrier” in such Act
included all pipelines. (A line laid on an oil lease to move crude oil from the
well-head to a lease storage tank, or from one lease storage tank to another,
is not considered to be a “common carrier”.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   For the period prior to 5/1/74,
activities involving the blending of gasoline by employees employed by a
pipeline company which was a carrier subject to Part I of the Interstate
Commerce Act were exempt under FLSA Sec 13(b)(2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24i03   Employees not within the FLSA Sec 13(b)(2) exemption.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The FLSA Sec 13(b)(2) exemption does not
apply to employees</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Who are not employed
by a carrier subject to Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Who do not perform
activities which subject their employer to Part I of the Interstate Commerce
Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
In any workweek in
which they are engaged in non­exempt work, in addition to the work which might
otherwise be within the scope of the exemption, if the nonexempt work amounts
to more than 20% of the total hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
Of a warehouse, if
the warehouse stores goods that have not been carried over the lines of the
railroad which owns the warehouse, and the storage of such goods constitutes a
substantial portion (which for enforcement purposes has been defined as more
than 20%) of the ware-house business, even though in addition to such business,
the warehouse stores goods that have been carried over the lines of the
railroad which owns the warehouse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5) 
Of an employer
engaged exclusively in a pick-up and delivery service under a contract with a
railroad express agency, as the employees are not employees of the railroad or
railroad express agency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6) 
Of a trucking
company, even though the trucking company may be wholly owned and controlled by
a railroad company, inasmuch as the trucking company is not an employer subject
to Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24i04   Livestock shipping establishment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An establishment which ships livestock
only for itself is not such a public stockyard as to constitute a “common
carrier” within Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act, and consequently is not
within the FLSA Sec l3(b)(2) exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24j00   General provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 13(b)(3) provides an exemption from
the OT provisions of the FLSA for “any employee of a carrier by air subject to
the provisions of Title II of the Railway Labor Act”.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24j01   Application of the carrier-by-air exemption.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The exemption under Sec 13(b)(3) is not
an industry or establishment exemption. It applies to individual employees of an
air carrier when their activities bear a reasonably close relationship to the
exempt type of transportation activities which bring the employer’s operation
under Title II of the Railway Labor Act. Title II applies to “every common
carrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign commerce, and every carrier by
air transporting mail for or under contract with the United States Government,
and every air pilot or other person who performs any work as an employee or
subordinate official of such carrier or carriers, subject to its or their
continuing authority to supervise and direct the manner of rendition of his
service”. The performance of nonexempt work will defeat the exemption where
such work exceeds 20% of the employee’s total work during a w/w (see IB 786, Subpart
A).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Work performed by mechanics on training
planes, transient planes, and on planes other than those used in operations
which subject the employer to Title II of the Railway Labor Act clearly has no
relation to exempt air transportation and would, if it constituted a
substantial part of their work, defeat the exemption. Flyers and other
employees who operate a flying school also perform nonexempt work, as do
employees who sell airplanes and parts.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24j02   Commuter airline pilots and air taxi/charter pilots.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The National Mediation Board has taken
the position that any carrier that has been issued an air taxi and commercial
operations (ATCO) certificate or an ATCO letter of registration by the Federal
Aviation Administration and is engaged in interstate operations is a common
carrier by air and subject to Title II of the Railway Labor Act. Thus, commuter
airline pilots and air taxi pilots employed by such carriers may be subject to
the Sec 13(b)(3) exemption. The Board does not assert jurisdiction over solely
intrastate operations when there is no significant carriage of mail.</p>
<h4> </h4>

<h3>24j03   Air freight forwarders.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Air freight forwarders are carriers by
air subject to the provisions of Title II of the Railway Labor Act if they are
owned or controlled by, or under common control with, a company that is
actually engaged in air transportation and if the air freight forwarders
perform services in connection with property transported by such other company.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24j04   Employees supplying food and meal service to airlines.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees of an air carrier who supply
food and meal service equipment such as thermos jugs, ovens, food racks, food
trays, silverware, napkins, china, and the like, to airlines for use on the
airplane are exempt under Sec 13(b)(3). Such employees are engaged in operating
equipment and facilities and per­forming services in connection with
transportation and handling of property transported by airlines. The exemption,
however, applies only to those employees of such a carrier engaged in work of a
nature which brings their employer within Title II of the Railway Labor Act.
Work performed by such a carrier which does not bear a reasonably close
relationship to the transportation activities that give rise to the exemption
will be regarded as nonexempt work and a substantial amount of nonexempt work
(more than 20% of the time worked by the employee during the w/w) will result
in loss of the exemption.</p>

<h3>24k00  General provisions of Secs 13(a)(12) and 13(b)(6) - IB 783.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 13(a)(12) provides an exemption from
the MW and OT provisions of FLSA for “any employee employed as a seaman on a
vessel other than an American vessel”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Sec 13(b)(6) provides an exemption from
the OT provisions of FLSA for “any employee employed as a seaman”, including
those on American vessels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The official WH interpretations of the
scope and meaning of the Secs 13(a)(12) and 13(b)(6) exemptions are contained
in IB 783.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24k01  Applicability of Secs l3(a)(12) and 13(b)(6) distinguished.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The tests for exemption under Secs
l3(a)(l2) and 13(b)(6) are identical except that the MW and OT exemption
provided by Sec 13(a)(12) is available only for seamen on vessels other than
American vessels. Seamen on American vessels may be exempt from OT, however,
under Sec 13(b)(6).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24k02  Tugboat night firemen - watchmen who never travel on boat.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A night fire-watchman, whose duties are
to hold steam at night, clean the ashes from under the boiler, put them overboard
with the boat’s steam ash remover, and siphon bilge water when necessary while
the vessel is tied up to the dock, and who does not travel on the boat nor
contributes towards its operation while in motion, is not a seaman within the
Secs l3(a)(12) and 13(b)(6) exemptions .</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24k03  Status of ferry boat employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Time spent mooring and unmooring the
ferry, hooking and unhooking the chain across the stern, and as a relief
operator is the work of a seaman and is, therefore, exempt work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The time spent in directing vehicles onto
the boat, placing blocks, collecting fares, leveling the landing, and work
about the ferry slip, such as cutting weeds, is not considered the work of a
seaman and is, therefore, not exempt.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24k04  Dredging, derrick, and salvage boat employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The seaman exemption does not apply to
employees whose service is not rendered primarily as an aid to the operation of
the vessel as a means of transportation. The operation of a derrick for loading
or unloading cargo or salvaging materials from underwater, or raising
underwater cables, or removing deposits from channels on navigable interstate
waterways in conjunction with improvements and construction work on such
waterways, whether from self-propelled or nonself-propelled dredges is not exempt
work under Secs l3(a)(12) and 13(b)(6).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24k05  Tenders of nonself-propelled barges.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An employee primarily employed on a
nonself-propelled barge used as a “stationary” auxiliary facility to off­shore
drilling activities, rather than as a means of transportation is not a seaman
within Secs 13(a)(12) and 13(b)(6).</p>

<h3>24L00  General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 13(b)(10) of the amended Act,
effective 5/1/74, provides an OT exemption as follows: (emphasis supplied)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(A)
Any salesman,
partsmen, or mechanic, primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles,
trucks or farm implements if he is employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment
primarily engaged in the business of selling such vehicles or implements to
ultimate purchasers; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(B) 
any salesman
primarily engaged in selling trailers, boats, or aircraft, if he is employed by
a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling
trailers, boats, or aircraft to ultimate purchasers;”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   For the period 2/1/67 - 4/30/74 old Sec
13 (b) (10) provided an OT exemption for “any salesman, partsman, or mechanic
primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles, trailers, trucks, farm
implements, or aircraft if employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment
primarily engaged in the business of selling such vehicles to ultimate
purchaser . . .” (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   For the period prior to 2/l/67, Sec
13(a)(19) provided an exemp­tion from both MW and OT for any employee of a
retail or service establishment which is primarily engaged in the business of
selling automobiles, trucks, or farm implements . . .”</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24L01  Application of Secs 13(a)(2) and 7(i).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The possibility of exemption under Sec
13(a)(2) or Sec 7(i) for employees of certain such establishments should not be

<p> </p>

<h3>24L02  Applicable MW rate.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employment by such an establishment which
would have been exempt from both MW and OT under old Sec 13(a)(19) prior to 2/1/67
is subject to the MW rate of Sec 6(b); employment by such an establishment
which would not have been qualified for exemption under old Sec 13(a)(19) as,
for example, because the 75% retail test was not met, may be subject to the MW
rate of Sec 6(a)(1).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24L03  Application of exemption - type of establishment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The statutory language of Sec 13(b)(10)
both prior to and subsequent to 5/1/74 limits the exemption to the specified
employees of nonmanufacturing establishments primarily engaged in the business of
selling automobiles, trailers, trucks, farm implements (boats effective 5/1/74)
or aircraft to ultimate purchasers. It does not apply to employees of
automobile parts and accessories wholesalers, retail auto parts stores,
automotive repair garages or other establishments not primarily engaged in
selling the named vehicles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   In the case of dealerships in the named
vehicles it will not be necessary, where departments functionally operated as
part of the dealership are at different locations, to determine whether they
are parts of the main establishment or physical places of business qualifying
as separate establishments under the customary tests. A specific legislative
intent to include all such parts of the dealership’s business as one
establishment for purposes of Sec 13(b)(10) is made plain by statements in the
legislative history that the exemption is intended to apply to the named
classes of employees employed by a dealership in the described vehicles “even
if they work in physically separate buildings or areas, or even if, though
working in the principal building of the dealership, their work relates to the
work of physically separate buildings or areas, so long as they are employed in
a department which is functionally operated as part of the dealership”. Thus,
for example, if a new car dealer operates a used car lot at a different
location, employees who work at that lot may qualify for the exemption if the
used car lot is operated as a part of the dealership. (See also IB 779.372(b)(1).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24L04  “Salesman”, “partsman”, and “mechanic”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sec 13(b)(10) provides an OT exemption
for employees of the various described establishments (see FOH 24L03) who are
employed as a “salesman”, “partsman”, or “mechanic”, and who are “primarily
engaged” (see IB 779.372(d)) in selling or servicing the named vehicles, farm
implements or aircraft (see chart FOH 24L04). Assuming that the establishment
tests are met, it is thus necessary to determine whether the employee’s duties
are in fact those of a salesman, partsman, or mechanic (or some combination of
these duties where appropriate), and, if so, whether he is primarily engaged in
selling or servicing the named vehicles, farm implements or aircraft. The
exemption applies on a w/w basis. It is not pertinent that such salesmen,
partsmen, or mechanics are individually engaged in selling to or servicing the
named product primarily for the “ultimate purchaser”; it is only necessary for
the establishment to be primarily so engaged for the exemption to be applicable
(see FOH 24L08).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   In determining whether an employee is in
fact a salesman, partsman, or mechanic, a primary duty test shall be applied.
Thus, for example, an employee to be classified as a “mechanic” must spend more
than 50% of his time in performing the duties of a mechanic, with respect to
the named vehicles, farm implements, or aircraft, including duties which are
incidental thereto. (For purposes of applying the primary duty test, all the
duties of an employee as a salesman, partsman, or mechanic may be combined.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Partsman.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The term “partsman”, as used in Sec
13(b)(10), means an employee whose primary duty is to requisition, stock, and
dispense parts for the named vehicles, farm implements or aircraft to be used
by the establishment’s employees, or to sell or dispense such parts to the
establishment’s customers (see IB 779. 372(c)(3)). This includes incidental
clerical duties involved in such work, and keeping the stockroom, bins, and
shelves in order. (See also subpart (e) of this Sec.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Mechanic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(See IB 779.372(c)(3).) The term
“mechanic”, as used in Sec 13 (b)(10), generally describes an employee whose
primary duty is to perform mechanical work on a named vehicle, farm implement,
or aircraft to place it in proper operating condition by making any necessary
adjustments or repairs. This includes an employee doing mechanical work such as
“get ready” mechanics, automotive, truck, trailer, farm implement or aircraft
mechanics, body or fender mechanics, used car reconditioning mechanics, and
wrecker mechanics. Work of the following types is not in itself considered
mechanical work for purposes of the primary duty test in applying Sec 13(b)(10)
even though performed on a named vehicle, farm implement or aircraft:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
washing, cleaning or
polishing</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
lubricating</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
packing wheel
bearings</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
changing oil and oil
filters</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5) 
changing tires</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6) 
painting</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7) 
carpentry</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8) 
dispatching</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9) 
installing or
repairing seat covers</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(10) 
checking, servicing,
or repairing the plumbing, electrical, and butane gas systems, the doors,
windows and other structural features of mobile home trailers (as opposed to
the running mechanisms, such as wheels axles, brakes, hitches, and signal
lights).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However,
such work may be performed in some instances by an employee as an incident to
mechanical work and would be included as the work of a “mechanic” in applying
the primary duty test. For example, an automotive repairman may install ball
joints or tie rods on the “front end” of a truck or automobile and lubricate
the repaired parts when he has finished; he may replace a broken piston and in
the process change oil and install a new oil filter; or he may replace a wheel
bearing and at the same time repack it with the necessary lubricant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Parts chaser.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A “parts chaser” whose primary duty is
that of a messenger to pick up needed parts, as directed, from the warehouse
and from other dealers is not exempt under Sec 13(b)(10) as a “partsman”. On
the other hand, if the primary duty of such an employee is to see to the
adequacy of the stock on hand and to procure necessary stock, to make billings,
and to clean parts for return to the factory under warranty replacement, he
would be considered a “partsman” for purposes of the exemption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Mechanic - irrigation systems.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Farm implement dealers who sell or
service irrigation systems and component parts (see FOH 24L07) may have
employees engaged in repairing such items or in cutting, fitting, and tailoring
at the shop the items sold, to meet the needs of a particular farming
operation. Such activities are considered to be those performed by a “mechanic”
as the term is used in Sec 13(b)(10). Employees engaged in assembly of an
irrigation system or components in the field (after repairs have been made or
the cutting, fitting and tailoring at the shop has been done) are not
performing the work of a “mechanic” to whom the exemption is intended to apply.
The possibility of exemption under Sec 13(a)(6) or Sec 13(b)(12) should not be
overlooked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Trimmers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some automobile dealers employ persons
called “trimmers”. The following are examples of duties performed by trimmers
which are considered mechanical work for purposes of the 50% test of section
13(b)(l0): repairing the cranking mechanism of car window; repairing interior
of doors and roofs of cars; repairing windshield wiper mechanisms; and repairing
chrome strips around door frames.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)  Diagnosticians and inspectors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees variously described as
diagnosticians and inspectors may be considered as being akin to service
writers. (See IB 779.372(c).) Such employees may use machines and also do visual
inspections to note the condition of a vehicle, and indicate the parts and
services necessary for repairs. Diagnosing and inspecting in and of itself, as
would be the case for example when diagnostic and inspection work is done for
other mechanics would not be exempt. However, where an employee is a mechanic
and is working as a mechanic and part of his employment is diagnosing and
inspecting the vehicle before doing the actual repair, such diagnostic and
inspection work is part of his exempt work.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Wage-Hour takes no position with respect
to alleged OT violations in any current investigation during the period prior

exemption on the basis of new Sec 13(b)(10) but would have been subject to OT
previously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>FOH INSERT 1757 (Rev No. 663) 5-3-2011 –
removed 24L04(k)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24L05  Auto rebuilding establishment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An establishment engaged in auto
rebuilding, such as rebuilding auto engines or transmissions, is not considered
a nonmanufacturing establishment for purposes of Sec 13(b)(10). (See also FOH
21fa00.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24L06  Fork lift vehicles.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Fork lift vehicles or other similar
industrial material handling equipment are not considered “trucks” for purposes
of Sec 13(b)(10).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24L07  “Farm implements”: irrigation systems.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The term “farm implements” is generic
rather than specific and includes all items referred to in old Sec 13(a)(19)
and present Sec 13 (b)(10), including such nonvehicular items as irrigation
systems and component parts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The cutting, fitting and tailoring in the
dealer’s shop of irrigation systems sold by a farm implement dealer is
considered to be subordinate and incidental to the sale of these items to the
ultimate purchaser and does not constitute “manufacturing” for purposes of
applying Sec 13(b)(10). (See also FOH 24L04(f).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24L08  “Ultimate purchasers”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 13(b)(10) provides “. . . if employed
by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of
selling such vehicles to ultimate purchasers”. Since it is not necessary that
the establishment be a retail or service establishment, whether a particular
sale of automobiles, trucks, or their component parts is at retail or wholesale
is not material. The crucial question is whether or not the sale is to the
ultimate purchaser. Wage-Hour’s position is that the over the counter sales of
parts to the general public, the sales at discount to truck lines for use in
repairing their vehicles, as well as the so-called insurance and warranty sales
of parts are all to the ultimate purchaser within the meaning of Sec 13(b)(10).
On the other hand, sales of parts to other dealers, service stations, body
shops, garages and other establishments likely to resell the parts are sales
for resale and not sales to the ultimate purchaser within the meaning of Sec
13(b)(10). The exemption is limited to nonmanufacturing establishments
primarily engaged (see IB 779. 372(d)) in selling the named vehicles to
ultimate purchasers.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24L09  Motorcycles, motor scooters, and motor bikes.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Motorcycles, motor scooters, and motor
bikes are not considered automobiles, trailers, or trucks for purposes of Sec
13(b)(10).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24L10  Snowmobiles.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Snowmobiles are not considered
automobiles, trailers, or trucks for purposes of Sec 13(b)(10).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24L11  IB 779.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>IB 779.371 - 779.372 contain the basic
interpretations (by the Adm) of the scope and terms of these exemptions. These
interpretations apply to the old Sec 13(a)(19) exemption and to the Sec 13
(b)(10) exemption prior to 5/1/74. Additionally these interpretations also
apply to the Sec 13(b)(10) exemption on and after 5/1/74 except that the
various job classifications and/or types of vehicles have been changed (see
chart FOH 24L04(i).)</p>

<h3>24L12  Assembling farm implements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The assembling of plows, harrows, etc.,
even though they are farm implements, should not be confused with the work of a
“get-ready mechanic” or the work that must be performed to prepare a functional
irrigation system (see FOH 24L04(d) and (f)). The assembling of a plow or other
such farm implement which has been cut to measurements and for which all the
parts have been manufactured to fit together is no different than the work of a
dealer assembling a “knocked down” bicycle, and is not the work of a mechanic
within the meaning of Sec 13(b)(10).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24L13  Mobile homes as “trailers”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   A mobile home qualifies as a “trailer”
within the meaning of Sec 13(b)(10)(B) if it is designed to be a vehicle or
moving conveyance. Mobile homes of any type (including “double/triple wides”)
may be considered to be trailers if they are designed to be transported from
place to place as a trailer, that is, if they have their own wheels and
suspension system and can be towed behind a powered vehicle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   WH will consider a mobile home to be a
trailer if it is built on a permanent chassis or transportation system which
includes a drawbar and coupling mechanism, frame, running gear assembly, and
lights.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The following definitions apply to the
components of a trailer chassis:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
“Drawbar and coupling
mechanism” includes the rigid assembly upon which the coupling mechanism is
mounted and which connects the manufactured home’s frame to the towing vehicle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
“Frame” refers to the
fabricated rigid substructure which provides support to the manufactured home
structure both during transport and on-site. It also provides a platform for
attachment of the rest of the transportation system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
“Running gear
assembly” includes suspension springs, axles, bearings, wheels, hubs, tires,
and brakes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
“Lights” means safety
lights and associated wiring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)    </p>
<p>(1) 
In 1976, the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development established safety standards (known
as the HUD Code) for manufactured housing intended for sale as trailers or
mobile homes. A label certifying conformance with these standards is required
to be affixed to all such mobile homes built since 6/15/76.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
For enforcement
purposes, the presence of the HUD Code label will be sufficient proof that the
manufactured home is being sold as a trailer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)    </p>
<p>(1) 
Notwithstanding (d)
above , it may be documented at the time of sale that parts of the
transportation system are to be removed and that the mobile home is to be
emplaced on a permanent foundation requiring extensive site preparation. A
mobile home sold under these conditions will not be considered a trailer within
the meaning of Sec 13(b)(10)(B).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Typical installation
on concrete pads with sewer and water connections, electricity, anchoring
apparatus or cables, and “skirting” is not considered permanent emplacement.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>24L14  Equipment which may be farm implements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>“Farm implements”, within the meaning of
Sec 13(b)(10)(A), refers to equipment and machinery normally used by farmers in
their farming operations. Equipment not customarily used in such operations, as
for example garden type tractors, small riding mowers, recreation type
vehicles, etc., are not “farm implements”. To illustrate further, tractors used
in farming are usually 35 horsepower or more. (See IB 779.371(e).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25a00. General provisions and IB 781.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
For periods prior to 2/1/67, Sec
13(a)(3) provided an exemption from the MW and OT provisions of the FLSA for
“any employee employed by any establishment engaged in laundering, cleaning, or
repairing clothing or fabrics, more than 50 percentum of which establishment’s
annual dollar volume of sales of such services is made within the State in
which the establishment is located: Provided, that 75 per centum of such
establishment’s annual dollar volume of sales of such services is made to
customers who are not engaged in a mining, manufacturing, transportation, or
communications business”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
IB 781 (WH Publication 1043)
contains the interpretations by the Adm of the scope and terms of this
exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25a01. Classification of business as manufacturing. mining. trans­portation
communications, or other.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
WH publication 1043 -IB 781.12(a),
(b), (c), and (d) contain examples of customers who are considered to be
engaged in the “mining, manufacturing, transportation, or communications
business”, for purposes of old Sec 13(a)(3). The following are further examples
of customers who are considered to be so engaged: newspapers, tire recappers,
and retail ice cream stands which process dairy products into ice cream.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Among those sales which are
considered to be sales made to a customer who is not engaged in the “mining,
manufacturing, trans­portation, or communications business” are sales to the
following (see also WH Publication 1043 - IB 781.14): wholesale and warehouse
businesses which do not manufacture but merely serve as wholesale distributors,
gasoline stations (regardless of ownership), grain commission offices, and
military bases such as Air Force bases, naval stations, and the like.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25a02. MW rate.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The MW standard to be applied on and after 5/1/74, is determined by
testing the employment by the requirements of the Act as it read before the
1966 Amendments. If a particular laundry or cleaning establishment would have
been exempt under old Sec 13(a)(3) the MW standard of Sec 6(b) applies. On the
other hand if the establishment would not have been exempt under old Sec
13(a)(3), the MW rate of Sec 6(a)(1) applies to individually covered
employment.</p>

<h3>25c00. Statutory provisions and IB 794.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Sec 7(b) (3) provides a partial OT
exemption for any employee employed: “by an independently owned and controlled
local enterprise (including an enterprise with more than one bulk storage
establishment) engaged in the wholesale or bulk distribution of petroleum
production if-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  the annual gross volume of sales of such enterprise is
less than $1,000,000 exclusive of excise taxes,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  more than 75 per centum of such enterprise’s annual
dollar volume of sales is made within the State in which such enterprise is
located, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  (not more than 25 per centum of the annual dollar
volume of sales of such enterprise is to customers who are engaged in the bulk
distribution of such products for resale,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and such employee receives compensation for employment in excess of
forty hours in any workweek at a rate not less than one and one-half times the
minimum wage rate applicable to him under section 6,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and if such employee receives compensation for employment in excess of
twelve hours in any workday, or for employment in excess of fifty-six ‘hours in
any workweek, as the case may be, at a rate not less than one and one-half
times the regular rate at which he is employed”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
IB 794 contains the basic interpretations
of the scope and terms of the Sec 7(b)(3) exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25c01. Failure to meet standards for “excess” hours.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The compensation requirements for an employee who otherwise qualifies
for exemption under Sec 7(b)(3) are stated in the conjunctive; consequently an
employee must be paid both (1) at a rate not less than one and one-half times
the applicable MW for hours in-excess of 40 and up to 56 in a w/w and (2) time
and one-half his/her regular rate for hours in excess of 12 in a day or 56 in a
week. If OT has not been paid in accordance with either or both of these
standards, BW are owed for hours worked in excess of these standards.  Replaced by FOH

<h3>25c02. Independently owned and controlled - leasing of real property.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of IB 794.114 and 794.115 Wage-Hour will
not deny the Sec 7(b)(3) exemption if the tests are otherwise met in cases
where a bulk petroleum distributor leases and does not own real property used
in his business provided the lease is bone tfide. A lease of valuable property
owned by the oil company which the distributor represents for only a nominal or
token rent will not be deemed bona fide.</p>

<h3>25d00. General provisions of Secs 13(a)(5) and 13(b)(4) and IB 784.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Sec 13(a)(5) provides an exemption
from the MW and OT provisions of FLSA for “any employee employed in the
catching, taking, propagating, harvesting, cultivating, or farming of any kind
of fish, shellfish, crustacea, sponges, seaweeds, or other aquatic
forms of animal and vegetable life, or in the first processing, canning or
packing such marine products at sea as an incident to, or in conjunction with,
such fishing operations, including the going to and returning from work and
loading and unloading when performed by any such employee”. This exemption was
not changed by the 1974 Amendments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Effective 5/1/74 Sec 13(b)(4)
provides an exemption from the OT provisions of FLSA for “any employee employed
in the canning, pro­cessing, marketing, freezing, curing, storing, packing for
shipment, or distributing of any kind of fish, shellfish, or other aquatic
forms of animal or vegetable life, or any byproducts thereof and who receives
compensation for employment in excess of 48 hours in any workweek at a rate not
less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The phrase “and who receives
compensation for employment in excess of 48 hours in any workweek at a rate not
less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed” was
added to the Act by the 1974 Amendments effective 5/1/74. Consequently, prior
to 5/1/74 employment within the terms of this exemption was completely exempt
from OT.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Effective 5/1/75 Sec 13(b)(4) is
amended by changing “48 hours” to “44 hours”; consequently, effective on this
date OT is due after 44 hours per week. Effective 5/1/76 Sec 13(b)(4) is
repealed and OT is due after 40 hours per week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
IB 784 contains the
interpretations by the Adm on the scope and terms of the FLSA Secs 13(a)(5) and
13(b)(4) exemptions for periods prior to and after 5/1/74.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25d02. Fish farming.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Fish farming is included in the
term “farming in all its branches” and an employee performing such activities
is engaged in agriculture within the meaning of Sec 3(f) (see FOH 20b04 and IB
780.109) . It may also be necessary in some situations to consider the
application of Secs 13(a)(5) and 13(b)(4), or a combination or exemptions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The applying Sec 13(a)(5), the
activities named in the exemption and such other activities as are so
functionally related to the named operations that they are, as a practical
matter, necessarily and directly a part of the named operations are considered
to be exempt activities. Thus, the repairing and cleaning of fish ponds, the
fertilization and breeding of fish, and the sorting of fish are exempt
activities. Also exempt, when performed as an integral part of the above
operations (see IB 784.113), would be the maintenance and repair of the tools
and equipment used in the above operations . The construction of new ponds or
buildings is not an exempt activity under Sec 13(a)(5).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The principles set out in IB
784.106, 784.127, and 784.153 shall be followed in applying the Secs 13(a)(5)
and 13(b)(4) exemptions to clerical employees of “fish farms”. In this
connection, the maintenance of records which are an integral part of the Sec
13(a)(5) exempt fish farming activities, such as the maintenance of breeding
records, records of feed consumption related to fish production and the like,
would be considered as exempt activities under Sec 13(a)(5).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
A 20% tolerance for nonexempt work
is permitted under both Secs 13(a)(5) and 13(b)(4). (See IB 784.116.)</p>

<h3>25e00. General provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Effective 5/1/74, Sec 13(b) (28)
exempts from the OT provisions of the FLSA “any employee employed in planting
or tending trees, cruising, surveying or felling timber, or in preparing or
transporting logs or other forestry products to the mill, processing plant,
railroad, or other transportation terminal, if the number of employees employed
by his employer in such forestry or lumbering operations does not exceed
eight”. (Emphasis added by underscoring.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
For the period 2/1/67 - 4/30/74,
the wording of old Sec 13 (a)(13) was identical to current Sec 13(b)(28);
however, Sec 13(a)(13) was both a MW and OT exemption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Prior to 2/1/67 the wording of Sec
13(a)(15) was identical to Sec 13(a)(13) except that the number of employees
read “does not exceed twelve” instead of “does not exceed eight”. (Emphasis
added.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Under the Act as amended, the exemption
continues to be in applicable in any w/w where the number of employees employed
by the employer in the named operations exceeds twelve. The MW standard of Sec
6(a)(l) and OT after 40 hours applies to such employment. Beginning 5/1/74, in
any w/w where all the tests of Sec 13(b)(28) are met except that the number of
employees exceeds eight but does not exceed twelve, the exemption does not
apply and the MW standard of Sec 6(b) and OT after 40 hours apply. In any w/w
where all the tests of the exemption are met, the MW rate of Sec 6(b) applies
and the employment is exempt from OT.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
The principles in IB 788 shall be
followed in applying Sec 13(b)(28) effective 5/1/74 and old Secs 13(a)(13) and
13(a)(15) prior to 5/1/74, and for rate purposes; the number twelve shall be
substituted for the number eight as appropriate. In the same manner the
principles stated in FOH 25e01 through 25e08 are applicable for purposes of
Secs 13(a)(13), 13(a)(15), and 13(b)(28).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25e01. Joint individual and corporate employment of logging employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where an employer operates a logging enterprise as an individual and
another logging enterprise through a corporation managed and substantially
owned by him, because of their affiliation, the individual operations and the
corporate operation, although separate legal entities, are in economic reality
an integrated business enterprise managed and substantially owned by the same
individual person who may equally control and receive the benefit of the
services of the employees of both operations. Consequently, if the total number
of employees employed in a particular w/w in both the individual and corporate
logging operations named in the exemption exceeds 8, (or 12 under old Sec
13(a)(15) prior to 2/1/67) the exemptions are inapplicable to any of the
employees for that w/w. This is so regardless of whether the two operations are
conducted independently in that there is no interchange of employees or
equipment.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25e02. Effect of number of employees of employer on forestry and logging
exemptions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The exemptions apply to the employees engaged in the logging operations
named in the exemptions even though their employer has 9 (or 13 under old Sec
13(a.)(15)) or more employees, so long as only 8 (or 12 under old Sec
13(a)(15)) or fewer of the employees are employed in the named logging
operations for the particular w/w. Thus, if an employer employs only 8 (or 12
under old Sec l3(a)(l5) employees in the named logging operations, and employs
other employees in operations not named in the exemption, such as sawmill
operations, the exemptions are not defeated because of the fact that he employs
more than 8 (or 12 under old Sec 13(a)(15)) employees altogether. The
exemptions will not apply, however, to those employees employed in operations
not named in the exemption. (See IB 788.14.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25e03. Employees to be counted in applying the forestry and logging
exemptions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The forestry and logging exemptions are limited to those employees
employed in the operations named in the exemptions, which operations include
“the incidental activities normally performed by persons employed in them” (IB
788.6). Crew supervisors (even though exempt under Reg 541), cooks, kitchen
helpers, bull cooks, timekeepers, and repair shop mechanics of a logging camp
are engaged in such incidental activities and are the usual members of crews
which go into the woods for the purpose of felling timber and preparing and
transporting logs. Therefore, these employees must be counted in determining
the number of employees the employer has engaged in forestry and logging
operations. If the total number of employees so engaged exceeds eight (12 under
old Sec 13(a)(15)) when crew supervisors, cooks, kitchen helpers, bullcooks,
timekeepers, and repair shop mechanics are counted, the exemptions do not
apply.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25e04. Employees in
planing and sawmill operations not exempt.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Employees in a planing mill or in
a sawmill, including such portable mills in the woods, are performing
operations connected with the processing of logs and, therefore, are not
exempt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Employees of a mill or a contract
carrier who truck logs from the woods to the mill are engaged in a named operation
(transporting logs to the mill) and are within the exemptions if the other
tests are met. Transporting lumber from the mill is not an exempt operation.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25e05. Construction of
access logging roads and trails.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Employees engaged in building
minor access roads, such as “plank” roads, “corduroy” roads, and similar
relatively simple roads for the transportation of logs from the felling site to
a central collection point, may be exempt. Another example is the cutting of a
trail, known as a “skid road”, through the woods for the removal of logs
dragged by a tractor or snaked out by a cable attached to a donkey engine. Such
a road may require minor clearing operations, including the removal of
underbrush, stumps, and trees to give the necessary access.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Exempt road building is that sort
normally done by the members of a logging crew. Employees who are employed in
constructing major logging roads, and employees building roads normally built
by persons who specialize in building roads, are not engaged in forestry or
logging operations within the meaning of the exemptions.  Major logging roads
are those from the central collecting points to the mill.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25e06. Forest nurseries.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Forest nurseries grow seedlings specifically for forest or woodland
planting, and are distinguished from ordinary landscape nurseries by the fact
that they usually make large-quantity sales of low-priced young seedlings,
rather than small-quantity sales of more expensive and older trees. Generally,
employees engaged in seeding new beds and transplanting seedlings in a forest
tree nursery for eventual forest planting come within the forestry and logging
exemptions, provided the limitation on the number of employees is met by the
employer. Such employees are not engaged in “agriculture”.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25e07. Logging incidental to land clearing or sawmilling.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The exemptions apply to employees who felled timber or transport logs
to the mill, regardless of the fact that the logging or transporting may be
incidental to land clearing or sawmilling operations . However, the trees
felled must be timber, that is, material for construction or processing. The
exemptions do not apply, in a land clearing project, where the felled trees are
burned or hauled away for dumping, nor does it apply to tree trimming along power
line rights-of-way.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25e08. Nonexempt work enforcement policy.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The exemption for an employee employed in exempt work is defeated in
any week in which he performs a substantial amount (more than 20%) of nonexempt
work. (See IB 788.17.)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25f00.  General provisions and IB 780. Subpart K.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Sec 13(d), second part, exempts
from the provisions of Secs 6, 7, and 12 “any homeworker engaged in the making
of wreaths composed principally of natural holly, pine, cedar, or other
evergreens (including the harvesting of the evergreens or other forest products
used in making such wreaths)”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
IB 780, Subpart K contains the
interpretations by the Adm of the scope and terms of the Sec 13(d), second
part, exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25f01.  “Wreaths”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The term “wreaths”, as used in Sec 13(d), includes not only the typical
circular patterns but also other patterns, such as sprays and ropes.</p>

<h3>25h00. General provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The exemption from OT provided by
FLSA Sec 7(j) for employers engaged in the operation of a hospital is explained
in Sec 778.601 of IB Part 778. This section supplements IB 778.601.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The exemption in Sec 7(j) applies
to employees of employers engaged in the activities comprising the operation of
a hospital.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Employees of the hospital entity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees employed by
the hospital entity may be subject to Sec 7(j). This includes not only the
typical hospital employees who work in the hospital but may also include, for
example, employees of an employer who owns and operates or operates pursuant to
a contract more than one hospital, who are engaged in performing the following
services for the hospitals: public relations, payroll, accounting,
administrative services, engineering, architecture and planning, community
relations, and personnel and labor relations and remodeling</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Employees employed in hospital operations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees in the
various medical laboratories and therapy services located in the hospital and
operated by the employer exclusively as an integral and essential part of the
hospital may be subject to Sec 7(j). Such employees must be employed in
medically related activities connected with the operation of the hospital. On
the other hand where the laboratory or therapy services are only providing a
service to the hospital and operate as an independent business which is not
part of the hospital enterprise, Sec 7(j) will not apply to their employees
because they are not deemed “employed by” an ‘employer engaged in the operation
of a hospital”. Similarly, an independent contractor providing nonmedically
related services, such as a contractor who provides janitorial or maintenance
services to a hospital may not use Sec 7(j) since the contractor is not engaged
in the medically related operations of a hospital.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Further, an employer engaged in the operation of a hospital may not
utilize the provision to relieve himself of his obligations under Sec 7(a) of
the Act with respect to any of his employees who devote a substantial part of
their worktime in the w/w to activities other than those in connection with the
operation of the hospital, such as custodial work for other tenants who occupy
leased space in the building. Such nonexempt work wilt be considered
substantial if it occupies more than 20% of the time worked by the employee in
the w/w.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Employees of a temporary help
company working on assignments in hospitals are considered to be jointly
employed by both the temporary help company and the hospital in which they are
employed. For enforcement purposes, Wage-Hour will not take exception to a
claim by a hospital that Sec 7(j) applies during any 14-day period where the
employees work exclusively for a single hospital provided that before
performance of the work am agreement is made between the hospital and the
employees to use the 14-day period in lieu of the normal w/w. This position is
taken without prejudice to the rights of individual employees under Sec 16(b).
On the other hand, Sec 7(j) will not apply to any employee who during a 14-day
work period is employed in more than one hospital even though all such
hospitals may be operating under Sec 7(j) with respect to their regular
employees.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25h01. Use of Sec 7(j).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A hospital has the option of complying with the OT provisions of Sec
7(a) or of utilizing Sec 7(j) with respect to any or all of its employees.
Thus, a hospital may elect to pay certain employees OT compensation as provided
by Sec 7(a) and with respect to other employees, may elect to utilize Sec 7(j)
of the Act.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25h02. Agreement or understanding.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An agreement or understanding may be presumed to exist for the purpose
of Sec 7(j) with respect to any employee who accepts payment of wages pursuant
to notice by the hospital that compensation will be made according to Sec 7(j).
Posting a notice on a bulletin board or advising employees by means of payroll
inserts constitutes sufficient notification for this purpose</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25h03. Application of the exemption.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h4>(a)   The regular
rate of pay for salaried employees under Sec 7(j) is determined in the normal
manner (see FOH 32b04) except that the “14-day period” is used rather than the
w/w. Thus for example an employee may be paid a salary intended to compensate
for up to 80 hours in a 14 day period in which case his regular rate would be
obtained by dividing his bi-weekly salary by 80 and he would be due 11/2 times
this rate for each OT hour in the 14-day period.</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>(b)   Where a swing shift
rotation results in an employee working two 8-hour shifts within a 24 hour
period, as defined in IB 778.601(d), the employee would be entitled to receive
OT compensation at a rate not less than one and one half times his regular rate
of pay for the hours worked on the second 8-hour shift. This is true
irrespective of the fact that the second 8-hour work period in the workday is a
regular part of the 80 hours scheduled biweekly by the hospital or the fact
that the second 8-hour shift starts the second 40-hour work period in the
14-day period. It should be noted that such premium for daily OT may be
credited towards OT compensation due for hours in excess of 80 for that period.</h4>
<p> </p>

<h3>25h04. Use of Sec 7(g)(2).</h3>
<p> </p>
<h4>An employer who uses Sec 7(j) may pay OT in accordance
with the principle of Sec 7(g)(2). (See FOH 32h.)</h4>
<h4><b> </b></h4>

<h3>25h05. Use of fluctuating w/w.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h4>(a)   If an employee
under Sec 7(j) is paid a salary with the understanding that is constitutes ST
pay for all hours worked in a 14-day period, his regular rate (not less than
the applicable MW rate) would be obtained by dividing his bi-weekly salary by
the number of hours worked in the 14-day period and he would be due additional
half time for each OT hour worked.</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>(b)   An employee
employed on a fluctuating w/w basis must receive his full bi-weekly salary
regardless of how few hours are worked in the 14-day period. The usual rules
regarding deductions apply. (See FOH 32b04b(b).)</h4>

<h3>25i00.  General provisions of the exemption.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Effective 5/1/74, Sec 7(j) is
amended by the addition of the phrase “or an establishment which is an
institution primarily engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, or the
mentally ill or defective who reside on the premises…”.  Consequently,
effective 5/1/74 employment in such establish­ments may be subject to the
special OT provisions of Sec 7(j) in the same manner as hospital employment. 
The Interpretations in IB 778.601 and FOH 25h00-25h05 are applicable to such
employment beginning 5/1/74.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Prior to 5/1/74 Sec 13(b)(8),
second part exempted from the OT provisions of the FLSA: “Any employee who (A)
is employed by an establishment which is an institution (other than a hospital)
primarily engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, or the mentally ill or
defective who reside on the premises and (B) receives compensation for
employment in excess of forty-eight hours in any workweek at a rate not less than
one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed” . This part of
Sec 13(b)(8) second part was repealed effective 5/1/74.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25i01.  Institutions primarily engaged in the care of the sick, the
aged, the mentally ill or defective residing on the premises defined.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>FOH 12f02 contains the definition of such institutions. This definition
shall be used for purposes of Sec 13(b)(8), 2nd part, prior to 5/1/74 and Sec
7(j) beginning 5/1/74.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25i02.  Sec 13(a)(2) not applicable to nursing homes.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Nursing homes are specifically excluded from exemption under Sec l3(a
)(2).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25i03.  Laundry operations by employees of residential care
institutions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 7(j) (see FOH 25i00) provides a partial OT exemption for an
establishment which is an institution primarily engaged in the care of the
sick, the aged, or the mentally ill or defective who reside on the premises”.
Laundry workers of an establishment which is considered such an institution,
employed by and engaged in performing the work of that establishment, may
therefore qualify for the exemption.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h3>25j00.  General provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Sec 13(a)(3) provides an exemption
from the MW and OT provisions of the FLSA for “any employee employed by an
establishment which is an amusement or recreational establishment, organized
camp, or religious or non-profit educational conference center if (A) it does
not operate for more than seven months in any calendar year, or (B) during the
preceding calendar year, its average receipts for any six months of such year
were not more than 33 1/3 per centum of its average receipts for the other six
months of such year”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
An “organized camp’
characteristically provides room and board in a rustic setting over a sustained
period of time. An “organized camp” is one with a program of activities and
sustained supervision, provided for a set fee. The American Camping Association
defines a “camp” as “a sustained experience which provides a creative
recreational and educational opportunity in group living in the out of doors.
It utilizes trained leadership and the resources of natural surroundings to
contribute to each camper’s mental, physical, social, and spiritual growth.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
A “religious or nonprofit
educational conference center “is a meeting center providing for religious,
educational and leadership growth experiences for both youth and adults. They
are usually built in secluded and scenic areas and often provide residence
accommodations, meal service and recreational facilities. Most are under the
sponsorship of religious denominations and are operated on a nonprofit and
tax-exempt basis.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j01.  Tests for the exemption.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
An “amusement or recreational
establishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference
center” will be exempt under Sec 13(a)(3) of the amended Act, if it meets
either test (A) or test (B) as explained in (b) and (c) below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
“(A) Does not operate for more
than seven months In any calendar year”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An amusement or recreational establishment, organized camp, or
religious or nonprofit educational conference center will be exempt if “it does
not operate for more than seven months in any calendar year”. Whether an
establishment “operates” during a particular month is a question of fact, and
depends on whether it operates as an amusement or recreational establishment,
organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference center. If an
establishment engages only in activities such as maintenance operations or
ordering supplies during the “dead season”, it is not considered to be
operating for purposes of the exemption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
(B) 33 1/3% test.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  An amusement or recreational establishment, organized
camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference center will be exempt if
“during the preceding calendar year, its average receipts for any six months of
such year were not more than 33 1/3 per centum of its average receipts for the
other six months of such year”. Since the language of the statute refers to
receipts for any six months (not necessarily consecutive months), the monthly
average based on total receipts for the six individual months in which the
receipts were smallest should be tested against the monthly average for six
individual months when the receipts were largest to determine whether this test
is me</p>
<p>(2)  To illustrate the principles in (1) above, consider an
amusement or recreational establishment, organized camp, or religious or
nonprofit educational conference center that is in a covered Sec 3(s)(1) 1)
enterprise as defined by the amended Act. The establishment operated for nine
months in the preceding calendar year. The establishment was closed during Dec.,
Jan., and Feb. The total receipts for May, June, July, Aug., Sept., and Oct.
(the six months in which the receipts were largest) totaled $260,000, a monthly
average of $43,333; the total receipts for the other six months totaled
$75,000, a monthly average of $12,500. Since the average receipts of the latter
six months were not more than 33 1/3% of the average receipts for the other six
months of the year, the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption will apply.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j02.  Establishments in national parks. national forests. or on lands
in the National Wildlife Refuge System.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Establishments such as those
selling groceries, curios, and dry goods, as well as gas stations, hotels,
motels, restaurants and the like, are generally not within the categories of
establishments which are commonly recognized as inherently of an amusement or
recreational character within the meaning of Sec 13(a)(3) of the Act. However,
certain such establishments in national parks, forests, or the Wildlife Refuge
System, are limited by policy of the Interior or Agriculture Departments to
merchandising only those items and providing only those services appropriate
for the public use and enjoyment of the areas administered by them. These
establishments operate under an exclusive contract with these Departments and
only during the season when these areas are open to the public. Under these
circumstances, the activities of these establishments are considered to have a
sufficiently intimate relation to the operation of these recreational areas to
warrant their characterization as “amusement or recreational” establishments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
As provided in Sec 13(a)(3), this
exemption from MW (Sec 6) and OT (Sec 7) “does not apply with respect to any
employee of a private entity engaged in providing services or facilities (other
than, in the case of the exemption from Sec 6, a private entity engaged in
providing services and facilities directly related to skiing) in a national
park or a national forest or on land in the National Wildlife Refuge System,
under a contract with the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of
Agriculture;”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
However, such employees, although
subject to the MW, may qualify for a partial exemption from OT as provided in
Sec 13(b)(29):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“any employee of an amusement or recreational establishment located in
a national park or national forest or on land in the National Wildlife Refuge
System if such employee (A) is an employee of a private entity engaged in
providing services or facilities in a national park or national forest, or on
land in the National Wildlife Refuge System, under a contract with the
Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture, and (B) receives
compensation for employment in excess of fifty-six hours in any workweek at a
rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is
employed.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
In order to qualify for exemption
under Sec 13(b)(29), one of the seasonality tests contained in Sec 13(a)(3)
must be met by the establishment. Moreover, the possible application of CWHSSA
to mechanics and laborers employed by such an establishment should not be
overlooked.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j03.  Resort hotels.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Resort hotels are generally not
considered amusement or recreational establishments for purposes of Sec
13(a)(3). However, if a resort hotel operates a particular facility (such as a golf
course or swimming pool) as a separate establishment, employees of such an
establishment might qualify for exemption under Sec 13(a)(3) from MW and OT if
all the tests are met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Where a resort hotel is located in
a national park, national forest, or on lands in the National Wildlife Refuge
System, such establishment is characterized as an “amusement or recreational”
establishment (see FOH 25j02(a) above), and its employees would be subject to
MW and to OT after 56 hours in the w/w under Sec 13(b)(29) (see FOH 25j02(c)
above).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j04.  “Employed by” an exempt establishment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
For purposes of applying Sec
13(a)(3), the general principles set forth in IB 779.308 - 779.311 apply. Thus
an employee, to be exempt, must be “employed by” the exempt establishment. In
some situations, such as an amusement park, baseball park, or racetrack, food
and souvenir vendors are employed by a concessionaire on the premises. If the
operations of the concessionaire constitute a separate establishment, the tests
of Sec 13(a)(3) are applied to the concessionaire’s establishment separately
without regard to the operations of the host establishment. On the other hand,
if the concessionaire and host constitute a single establishment, as is usually
the case, the tests apply on the basis of all the operations of the
establishment, including those of the concessionaire. (See IB 779.302 -
779.306.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Employment in central functions of
an organization operating more than one such establishment, as in the case of
employees of a central office, warehouse, garage, or commissary which serves a
chain of exempt “amusement or recreational” establishments would not be within
the exemption under Sec 13(a)(3).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The word “establishment” has the
same meaning under Sec 13(a)(3) as under old Sec 13(a)(2) (see IB779.303).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j05.  Employees at a convention.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees at a convention (including those employed by a
concessionaire) are not within the scope of the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption as a
convention is not considered an exempt establishment.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j06.  Country and town clubs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
A country or town club whose
membership fees are nominal (for example, $100 per year) would be considered to
be open to the general public and may qualify for the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption if
either test described in (A) or (B) is met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>(b)   </b>However, a country or town club which is not open to
the general public, but is available only to a select group of persons (or
their guests) who have been specifically selected to club membership or whose
membership fees are so high as to exclude the general public, is not considered
an amusement or recreational establishment for purposes of the Sec 13(a)(3)
exemption.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>25j07.  Marinas.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A marina is an establishment which is typically engaged in providing
boat storage for rent, in selling boating supplies, fishing tackle, oil, fuel,
grocery items, new and used boats, as well as providing refinishing and repair
service for boats. Such an establishment is not considered an amusement or
recreational establishment within the meaning of Sec 13(a)(3). Such an establishment
is used by persons engaged in recreation but does not itself provide the
recreation.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j08.  “New business” - application of Tests A and B.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Tests A and B refer to a calendar
year throughout which the operations of the establishment can be tested to
determine its character as a seasonally operated place of business. In the case
of a new business, Tests A and B are to be applied as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Test A.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Generally, Test A is
not met by a new business establishment which has operated for no more than 7 months
in a calendar year for the reason that its business operations did not start
until a considerable portion of the year had elapsed. If, however, the
character of the establishment is that of an “amusement or recreational
establishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference
center” whose operations are shown by acceptable evidence to be subject to
seasonal factors which would require the establishment to cease operations for
five months or more in the calendar year even if it had been in business for
the entire calendar year, the new business establishment may meet the
requirements of Test A so that its employees will be exempt. For example, an
employer may open a new ski slope establishment in November under circumstances
where it is clear that the establishment would have operated less than seven
months in the year regardless of the date it began operations. In such a case
the establishment could claim the exemption under Test A.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Test B.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Test B is based on the
establishment’s experience “during the preceding calendar year.” Generally this
requires an entire year’s experience to apply Test B in order to make the
necessary calculation. However, in the case of a new business where there is no
“preceding calendar year” on which to apply Test B, WH will apply the following
criteria in determining the applicability of Sec 13(a)(3)(B):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
If the enterprise of which the new
establishment is a part operates other seasonal amusement or recreational
establishments, organized camps, or religious or nonprofit educational
conference centers of the same type in the same general area under
substantially the same conditions and all such establishments conclusively and
clearly meet the condition of Test B; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
If such employer does not have
other such establishments but other employers operating the same type of
establishment in the same general area under substantially the same conditions
and manner of operation clearly are entitled to exemption under Test B.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Wage-Hour will consider the
exemption applicable in the year the new establishment begins operation if
either of these tests are met provided, however, that in the event after a
year’s operation the establishment does not qualify under Test B, proper MW and
OT is paid retroactively.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j09.         Summer programs of schools.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Some elementary or secondary schools or institutions of higher
education which are academically accredited during the fall through spring
semesters operate establishments that provide summer recreation or summer camp programs.
Where such programs meet the requirements of Sec 13(a)(3)(A) or (B) and are not
a part, continuation, or extension of the accredited academic program of the
school, such an establishment may qualify as “an amusement or recreational
establishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference
center” pursuant to the exemption, even though some credit courses may be
offered on a voluntary basis along with the recreational activities. The
applicability of Sec 13(a)(3) to employees of such an establishment is not
defeated by the fact that the same distinct physical place of business is for
part of the year a “school” and for part of the year “an amusement or
recreational establishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational
conference center.”</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j10.  Application of exemption to State and local government
facilities.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Golf courses, swimming pools, summer camps, ice skating rinks, and
similar establishments are the type which may qualify for exemption under Sec
13(a)(3). Activities conducted during the summer months in a city’s parks such
as playground activities, arts and crafts, sports programs, and related
activities which are in operation for not more than 7 months of the year may
also come within this exemption. Playground counselors, arts and crafts
instructors, and games leaders are the type of employees who may be exempt as
long as they work solely in a park or parks in such exempt activities. Of
course, as provided in FOH 25j04(b), the exemption is not applicable to central
office employees of the parks or recreation department or to maintenance crews
who operate out of a central facility responsible for the maintenance and
cleaning of all the city’s parks.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j11.  Beach and boardwalk facilities.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If the tests are met, the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption for amusement parks
and recreational areas is applicable in the case of either private or public
amusement and recreational activities directly related to the operation of a
beach and boardwalk. Lifeguards on a beach, drivers of a motorized train along
a boardwalk, and comfort station attendants at those stations operated solely
for the convenience of the persons patronizing the beach come within this
exemption. In the case of a public agency, those employees solely employed in
the cleaning of the beach may also come within the exemption as long as they
are not engaged in any work related to the cleaning of the city’s streets or
other parks (see FOH 25j04(b)).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j12.  “Receipts” of State or local government-operated amusement or
recreational establishments.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 13(a)(3)(B) contains certain percentage tests for “receipts” of the
establishment. As used here, receipts are fees received from admissions. A
state or local government-operated amusement or recreational establishment whose
operating costs are met wholly or primarily from tax funds would fail to
qualify under Sec 13(a)(3)(B). However, such an establishment may qualify under
Sec 13(a)(3)(A).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j13.  Employees of an exempt establishment - construction activities.</h3>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Employees of a Sec 13(a)(3) exempt establishment who engage in
construction or reconstruction work do not qualify for the Sec 13(a)(3)
exemption in any w/w in which they are so engaged. For example, employees of an
amusement park who, in addition to their maintenance and repair work, engage in
the erection of new structures, buildings, and places of entertainment designed
to continue the public’s  interest, are not within the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption
in any w/w that some (there is no tolerance for such nonexempt work)
construction work is performed. (See also FOH 21k07.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j14.  State and county fairs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The activities of the usual State or county fair are analogous to those
of an amusement park, carnival, or circus, i.e., it has rides, exhibitions,
side shows, etc., and its revenues are derived principally from selling
admissions to such events. State and county fairs may thus qualify for the Sec
13(a)(3) exemption if the tests are met.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j15.  Campsites and campgrounds.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Campsites and campgrounds provide
facilities where the general public may camp in tents, campers, recreational
vehicles, travel trailers, or motor homes. They may include paved driveways and
furnish water, waste and electrical outlets, picnic benches and tables,
restrooms and showers, laundry facilities, ice houses, bottled gas and grocery
facilities, and provide for handling mail and various recreational pursuits.
The camping season usually runs from the end of May through the Labor Day
weekend, but in milder climates some campgrounds have a longer season and
others are open year-round.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
An exempt campsite or campground
operates and maintains its establishment as a functional amusement or
recreational unit, i.e., providing facilities for camping as a recreational
activity. It may provide swimming, boating, or fishing facilities as well as
facilities for various other amusement or recreational activities such as
volleyball, horseshoes, miniature golf, movies, dances, contests, bonfires, and
the like. It may be located on either state or local government or private
land. Such a campsite or campground may be considered an amusement or
recreational establishment for the purpose of Sec 13(a)(3) and tested for
exemption under clause (A) or (B) of that section.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
On the other hand, if a campsite
or campground merely provides space and parking facilities which the travelling
public uses while in transit to a recreational area (as opposed to (b) above),
the campsite or campground is not an amusement or recreational establishment
for purposes of Sec 13(a)(3). At such a facility the travelling public usually
stays for only a short period of time such as one or two nights.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j16.  Drive-in theaters.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Drive-in theaters may qualify for the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption if either
of the tests is met.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25j17.  Riverboat cruises.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Businesses engaged in conducting riverboat cruises for sightseeing and
entertainment purposes may qualify for the Sec 13(a)(3) exemption where the
tests for the exemption are met and the majority of the firm’s revenue is
derived from ticket sales and entertainment, rather than food, drink,
concessions, and gifts. For purposes of applying the exemption, treat
riverboats, docking, and ticketing facilities as one establishment.</p>

<h3>25k00. Statutory provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Effective 5/1/74, sec 13 (a)(15)
provides a MW and OT exemption for “any employee employed on a casual basis in
domestic service employment to provide baby­sitting services or any employee
employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for
individuals who (because of age or infirmity) are unable to care for themselves
(as such terms are defined and delimited by regulations of the Secretary).”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Regulations will be issued to
define and delimit these terms</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25k01. Personal health care at home.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Trained personnel such as nurses, whether registered or practical, are
not exempt under Sec 13(a)(15). See also FOH 10c16. However, registered nurses
may be exempt as professional employees under See 13(a)(1) depending on the
facts.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25k02. Persons attending invalid infants and young children.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Individuals other than trained personnel such as nurses (see FOH 25k01)
who attend invalid infants and young children are considered companions, rather
than babysitters, and the employment thus may be within the Sec 13(a)(15)
exemption. (See Reg 552.106.)</p>

<h3>25L00. Statutory provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Effective 1/1/75, Sec 7(k) of the
amended Act provides a partial OT exemption for any employee of a public agency
engaged in fire protection activities or any employee engaged in law
enforcement activities (including security personnel in correctional
institutions) if -</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  in a work period of 28 consecutive days the employee
receives for tours of duty which in the aggregate exceed 240 hours; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  in the case of such an employee to whom a work period
of at least 7 but less than 28 days applies, in his work period the employee
receives for tours of duty which in the aggregate exceed a number of hours
which bears the same ratio to the number of consecutive days in his work period
as 240 hours bears to 28 days (60 hours in a work period of 7 days),
compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at
which he is employed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Effective 1/1/76, OT compensation
must be paid for hours in excess of 232 in a work period of 28 days (58 hours
in a work period of 7 days) or in the case of any work period between 7 and 28
days, a proportionate number of hours in such work period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Effective 1/1/77, OT compensation
must be paid for hours in excess of 216 in a work period of 28 days (54 hours
in a work period of 7 days) or in the case of a work period between 7 and 28
days, a proportionate number of hours in such work period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Effective 1/1/78, OT compensation
must be paid for hours which exceed the lesser of: (A) 216 hours, or (B) the
average number of hours in tours of duty during 1975 (as determined by the
Secretary in a study conducted pursuant to Sec 6(c)(3) of the FLS Amendments of
1974) in a work period of 28 days or in the case of a work period between 7 and
28 days, a proportionate number of hours in such work period.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25L01. Weigh station inspectors.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Weigh station inspectors, even though given certain “general police
powers”, are not engaged in an activity within the traditional meaning of the
term “law enforcement activities” and therefore do not qualify for the Sec 7(k)
exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25L02. Trading time.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The criteria for trading time on regularly scheduled tours of duty are
contained in Reg 553.18. It is our position that the period within which time
traded must be paid back is not confined to a specific calendar or fiscal year.
Each increment of traded time must, however, be paid back within 365 days (12
months) from the day the time was actually traded unless the death, severance,
or retirement of the employee owed for the time occurs sooner.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25L03. Public agency security personnel handling convicts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Any employee of any public agency who performs the duties described in
Reg 553.4(e), i.e., the responsibility of maintaining and controlling the
custody of prisoners and guarding them, may qualify for the Sec 7(k) exemption.
It is not necessary, for example, that the employees be employed by a
department of public safety or similar public agency in order to be exempt. The
employee may be employed by a highway department, recreation department, etc.
Further, “ security personnel in correctional institutions” need not meet the
tests specified in Reg 553.4(a)(l), 553.4(a)(2) and 553.4(a)(3) to qualify
under Sec 7(k). A “correctional institution” is defined to mean any Government
facility maintained as part of the penal system for the incarceration or
detention of persons suspected or convicted of having breached the peace or
committed some other crime. “Security personnel” does not include nurses,
janitors, cooks, recreational directors, etc.</p>

<h3>25m00.            Statutory provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Sec 13(b)(20) of the amended Act
provides --</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  an exemption from OT during the period of 5/l/74 -
12/31/74 for any employee of a public agency who is employed in fire protection
or law enforcement activities (including security personnel in correctional
institutions);</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  effective 1/1/75, an exemption from OT for any
employee of a public agency who in any w/w is employed in fire protection
activities or any employee of a public agency who in any w/w is employed in law
enforcement activities (including security personnel in correctional
institutions), if the public agency employs during the w/w less than 5
employees in fire protection or law enforcement as the case may be. These
provisions are separately tested and separately applied. Thus, for example, in
a town that employs 5 employees in law enforcement activities and 4 employees
in fire protection activities, only the fire protection employees may qualify
for exemption under this provision.</p>

<h3>25n00. Statutory provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Effective 5/1/74, Sec 13 (b)(21)
provides an OT exemption for “any employee who is employed in domestic service
in a household and who resides in such household”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The hours worked by such live-in
domestics will be determined under the principles of IB 785.23.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
See FOH 30b22.</p>

<h3>25o00. General provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Effective 5/l/74 Sec 13(g)
provides: “The exemption from section 6 provided by paragraphs (2) and (6) of
subsection (a) of this section shall not apply with respect to any employee
employed by an establishment (1) which controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with, another establishment the activities of which are not
related for a common business purpose to, but materially support, the
activities of the establishment employing such employee; and (2) whose annual
gross volume of sales made or business done, when combined with the annual
gross volume of sales made or business done by each establishment which
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the establishment
employing such employee, exceeds $10,000,000 (exclusive of excise taxes at the
retail level which are separately stated), except that the exemption from
section 6 provided by paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall
apply with respect to any establishment described in this subsection which has
an annual dollar volume of sales which would permit it to qualify for the
exemption provided in paragraph (2) of subsection (a) if it were in an
enterprise described in section 3(s).”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The application of this Sec of the
Act is more fully explained in Chapter 21 (re Sec 13(a)(2)) and Chapter 20 (re
Sec 13(a)(6)).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25o01. Common control under Sec 13(g).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec 13(g) requires common control for an establishment to be considered
part of a conglomerate (see FOH 25o00). WH will consider common control under
Sec 3(r) to be the same for purposes of Sec 13(g).</p>

<h3>25p00. Statutory provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Effective 5/1/74, Sec 13(b)(24) provides an exemption from OT for any
employee who is employed with his spouse by a non-profit educational
institution to serve as the parents for children -</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   who are orphans or one of whose natural parents is
deceased, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   who are enrolled in such institution and reside in
residential facilities of the institution,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>while such children are in residence at such institution, if such
employee and his spouse reside in such facilities, receive, without cost, board
and lodging from such institution and are together compensated, on a cash
basis, at an annual rate of not less than $10,000.</p>
<p><i> </i></p>

<h3>25p01. Enforcement policy for period prior to 5/1/74.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Adm will take no position with respect to alleged OT violations in
any current investigation during the period prior to 5/1/74 where the employee
is entitled to the OT exemption on the basis of new Sec 13(b)(24) but would
have been subject to OT previously.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>25p02. Hours worked.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Any reasonable agreement between the parties which takes into
consideration all the pertinent facts, within the meaning of IB 785.23, is
permissible in determining hours worked by exempt house-parents for MW
compliance purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: With regard to FOH
25p00, a word of explanation is in order. Sec 13(b)(24)(A) is followed by the
word “and” rather than the word “or” which appears in the FLSA as amended. The
reason we have done this in the FOH is because extensive and exhaustive
research has made clear that the ‘74 Amendments contained an error in wording.
That is, in order to remain logically consistent with all that was stated on
the Record concerning this exemption, it is obvious that the word “and” rather
than “or” should have been printed between points (A) and (B):</p>
<p>see p. 10, Sec 17 of Public Law 93-259 in FOH Vol I. Thus, it has been
determined that the word “and’ is correct and should be used in construing the
exemption. That is why we put “and” in FOP. 25p00, and also why there are no
quotation marks at the beginning and end of the exemption, since it is not an
exact quotation.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30a00 - Statutory basis.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Certain of the laws enforced by WH provide for
R/K regulations. Section 11(c) of FLSA requires the S/L to issue regulations
(Reg 516) prescribing R/K requirements.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30a01 - Microfilms and data processing tapes.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The
preservation of microfilms for the periods required by Reg 516 will satisfy the
requirements relating to preservation of records, provided that adequate
projection or other viewing equipment is available for inspecting the
microfilms, and provided the employer is prepared to make any extensions,
recomputations, or transcriptions which may be requested regarding the
information contained on the microfilms. The employer should insure that the
microfilms are clear reproductions of the original records, are identifiable as
to dates or pay periods, and are chronologically arranged before the original
records are destroyed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Situations
may be encountered where the original basic source document on which time
records are maintained is an automatic word or data processing memory. The
preservation of this data base for the periods required will satisfy Reg 516,
provided the employer is able to convert the data, or any part of it, into a
form which is suitable for inspection.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30a02 - Recording working time.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   In
recording working time, insubstantial or insignificant periods of time outside
the scheduled working hours may be disregarded. The courts have held that such
trifles are de minimis. This rule applies only where a few seconds or minutes
of work are involved and where the failure to count such time is due to
considerations justified by industrial realities. An employer may not
arbitrarily fail to pay for any part, however small, of the employee’s fixed or
regular working time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   It has
been found that in some industries, particularly where time clocks are used,
there has been the practice of recording the employee’s starting and stopping
time to the nearest five minutes, or to the nearest one-tenth or quarter of an
hour. For enforcement purposes, this practice of computing working time will be
accepted, provided that it is used in such a manner that it will not result,
over a period of time, in the failure to compensate the employees properly for
all hours they have actually worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   If a
record is kept with respect to each employee employed on a weekly or monthly
basis in an establishment or department thereof operating on a fixed schedule,
indicating the exact schedule of hours per day and hours per week which that
employee is normally expected to work, and if the payroll (or other) records
maintained by the employer indicate for each worker or for each group of
workers that such scheduled hours were, in fact, adhered to, this will be
considered compliance with Reg 516. When fewer or more hours than those fixed
by the schedule are worked, the employer must supplement this record by showing
the exact number of hours worked on the day and week involved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   The
records must also contain a statement made each pay period that, except where
otherwise recorded, the employees worked neither more nor less than the
scheduled hours. This policy is applicable only where hours of work are
actually fixed and it is unusual for the employee(s) to work either more or
less than the scheduled hours.</p>

<h3>30a03 - “Long-punching” of hours.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Where
time records show elapsed time greater than the hours actually worked because
of reasons such as employees choosing to enter their work places before actual
starting time or to remain after their actual quitting time, the CO shall
determine whether any time is actually worked in these intervals. If an
employee came in early for personal convenience and did no work prior to the
scheduled beginning time, a recording of the fact that the employee worked, for
example, 8 hours that day is all that is required.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The CO
may suggest to the employer, but not require, that the punch-time be kept as
close to the work-time as possible to avoid any question that work was
performed during such intervals.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30a04 - “Boosted hours”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>COs may find in the payroll records a single
figure (either daily or weekly) which represents the total hours actually
worked plus one-half of the OT hours, in lieu of separate entries for
straight-time and OT hours of work. This is particularly so where machine
posting methods are used. For example, if an employee works 50 hours in the
workweek and is entitled to OT pay after 40 hours, the “boosted hour” posting
will be 55 hours. The recordkeeping requirements are met in the case of hourly
rate employees by an entry showing “boosted hours”, provided the payroll or
other records contain sufficient information so that it is possible, with a
reasonable amount of recomputation, to ascertain weekly straight-time earnings
and weekly compensation for OT. Such information includes:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  actual hours
worked,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  regular hourly
rate of pay,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  additions to or
deductions from wages, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  total wages
paid.</p>

<h3>30a05 - Items available by extension. recomputation. or transcription.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   No R/K
violation shall be charged where the employer is maintaining records in such
detail as to be able to ascertain the information in the required individual
items in the various sections of the Reg either upon direct review or through
extension, recomputation, or transcription, and the employer is preserving the
data for the periods specified. The use of symbols (such as checkmarks to
indicate a regular day’s work) in lieu of showing the hours worked as numerals
is acceptable, provided there is a key to the symbols which will permit a
determination of the time actually recorded as hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The CO
may require an employer to make extensions, recomputations, or transcriptions
of records as provided in Reg 516.8 if determination of the employer’s
compliance status through direct review of the records is impracticable. Great
care must be exercised to avoid making unreasonable demands under the
regulations.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30a06 - Postings requirements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The R/K regulations under FLSA, MSPA, and the
government contracts programs require the posting of a poster at the
establishment or jobsite which summarizes the laws’ basic requirements. If such
a poster is not in place, the CO shall charge a recordkeeping violation and
instruct the employer to correct the situation.</p>

<h3>30a07 - Photographically reproduced posters.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An ARA
may approve a request from an employer to post posters photographically
reproduced in a reasonable and moderate size, provided there is no attempt to
evade the posting requirements and the reproductions are of such size and so
placed as to be read easily by the employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   If there
is doubt as to whether a particular photographic reproduction of a particular
poster meets the foregoing requirements, the ARA shall submit the reproduction
to the NO for advice.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30a08 - Modification of FLSA poster.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Any employer of employees to whom section 7 of
FLSA does not apply because of a total establishment exemption from that
section may alter or modify the FLSA poster so as to show that the OT
provisions do not apply to employees in the establishment. This may be done by
appending a note to that effect or by superimposing such a notation by a stamp
or other means across that part of the poster which pertains to the statutory
OT requirements. For example, in the case of railroad employees, the notation
may be worded as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“OVERTIME PROVISION NOT APPLICABLE TO RAILROAD
EMPLOYEES” (Sec 13(b)(2).)”</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30a09 - Joint employers of an employee</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In cases where two or more employers are joint
employers of an employee, the employer who actually pays the employee the
monies intended as compensation for hours of employment is considered
responsible for the keeping of records required by the Reg, and is treated as
the one who has the primary duty of compliance as to such hours of employment.
Where each employer makes direct payment to the employee, the employer being
investigated may be deemed to be the one having the primary duty of compliance.</p>

<h3>30b00 - FLSA MW.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The FLSA
MW rate is $3.35 per hour, effective 1/1/81.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4> </h4>

<h3>30b01 - Monthly salary equivalents.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Since the
number of regularly scheduled work hours may be greater in long months than in
short months, the strict allocation of a regular monthly salary to the hours
worked within each month may result in a technical MW violation in the longer
months. However, for enforcement purposes, a regular monthly salary of $580.67
shall be considered as equivalent to a weekly wage of $134.00 and accepted as
compliance with the $3.35 MW requirement if it is compensation for 40 hours of
work or less in the w/w. If the employer rounds out this amount to not more
than $585.00 per month, this will not affect the regular rate (i.e., $3.35) for
OT purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Where an
employee is paid a salary for a period in excess of a w/w (for example, on a
monthly or semi-monthly basis) and works an alternating schedule of fixed
w/w’s, and an equal allocation of the salary would result in payment of less
than the MW for the long w/w’s, there will be compliance with the MW provisions
of FLSA provided:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  the salary is
sufficient to meet the MW requirements for all hours worked during the pay
period; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  there is an
agreement or understanding between the parties that a larger portion of the
salary is to be allocated to the longer w/w’s. The employer shall be advised
that the firm’s records should properly reflect the allocation of the salary on
a w/w basis.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30b02 - Minimum rate of pay for non-OT weeks.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In non-OT w/w’s or in w/w’s in which the OT
provisions do not apply, an employee subject to section 6 of FLSA is considered
to be paid in compliance if the overall earnings for the w/w equal or exceed
the amount due at the applicable MW. This is true regardless of whether the
employee is paid on the basis of a single hourly rate, different hourly rates,
commissions, certain bonuses, or some combination of these methods. In other
words, if the employee’s total earnings for the w/w (including certain bonuses
such as a production bonus - see FOH 30b07) divided by compensable hours equals
or exceeds the applicable MW, the employee has been paid in compliance with Sec
6. These principles will also apply where an employee is not compensated for
time which is compensable under FLSA. For example, if an employee subject to
the $3.35 MW during a w/w is paid for 32 hours at $5.50 per hour and is paid at
a lesser rate or nothing at all for 8 or fewer additional hours worked, this
individual is considered to have been paid in compliance with Sec 6. The WH
position regarding proper payment in w/w’s where OT is due is set out in 32j02.</p>

<h3>30b03 - Regular rate of pay for OT weeks.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The
principles in FOH 32j02 shall be followed in determining compensation due
employees in OT w/w’s.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30b04 - Time of payment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Payment of both MW and OT compensation due an
employee must ordinarily be made at the regular payday for the w/w or, when the
pay period covers more than a single week, at the regular payday for the period
in which the particular w/w ends. However, when it is not possible, prior to
preparing the payroll, to ascertain the number of OT hours worked by an
employee in the last w/w of the pay period, the requirements of
FLSA/PCA/SCA/CWHSSA will be satisfied if the employer pays the OT compensation
as soon after the regular payday as is practicable. Such a payment should not
be delayed for a period longer than is reasonably necessary for the employer to
compute and arrange for the payment of the amounts due, but, in any event, not
later than the next payday after such computation can be made.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30b05 - Employee compensated on a commission basis.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Many
employers, especially in retail enterprises, compensate certain employees
wholly or in part on a commission basis. The methods of computation and payment
involving commissions vary widely (see IB 779.413) and the determination of
MW/OT compliance must be made on the facts of each case. The general principles
(except in circumstances where Sec 7(i) is applicable) are as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   If an
employee paid wholly or in part on a commission basis is subject to OT, the
principles set out in IB 778.117 - 778.122 shall be followed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   If an
employee paid on a commission basis is exempt from OT, such as salespersons
referred to in Sec 13(b)(l0) of FLSA, the following shall be used in determining
whether the employee is paid in compliance with MW requirements:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  There is no
requirement that wages be paid weekly, as long as some regular pay period (such
as biweekly or monthly) is established by the employer. The only requirement is
that employees receive “prompt payment” of the MW covering all hours worked
during the pay period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  A “settlement
period” does not have to coincide with the regular pay period. However, in the
absence of strong evidence to the contrary, it must be assumed that an employer
intended that a settlement period for commissions represents the pay period for
the affected employees. Where a pay (settlement) period exceeds one month, the
facts should be developed and the issue submitted to the NO (Attn: AA/OPO)
since the bona fides of the pay (settlement) period raise serious questions as
to the validity of the pay arrangement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Periodic draws
against commission earnings within the pay (settlement) period need not equal
the MW. Employers may credit these draw or guarantee payments against their MW
obligation when settling out the amount due employees at the end of the pay
(settlement) period. The following examples illustrate this principle. Assume a
4-week month and that a commission salesperson exempt from OT works 50 hours a
week (50 x $3.35 - $167.50):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     The
employer has established payment of a weekly draw against commissions and a
monthly pay (settlement) period. The salesperson draws $125 a week against
earned commissions. By the pay (settlement) date, the commission salesperson
has earned $950 in commissions. The employer pays the salesperson $450 ($950 -
$500 previously paid by weekly draw). This commission salesperson has been paid
in compliance with the monetary requirements of FLSA by being paid at least the
MW for all hours of work during the pay (settlement) period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
b.     The
circumstances are the same as in a. above, but the employer only pays the
salesperson $170 at the end of the pay (settlement) period in order to bring
the individual up to the MW and carries the balance of $280 over, to be paid on
the next pay (settlement) period, thus crediting it toward the MW obligation
for that subsequent pay (settlement) period. This salesperson has also been
paid in compliance with FLSA. Commissions earned but not paid on the next pay
(settlement) date which are in excess of the amount required to satisfy MW
requirements may be carried forward and applied to the MW on subsequent pay
(settlement) dates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     The
circumstances are the same as in a. above, except that the salesperson has
earned only $500 in commissions and is paid an additional $170 at the end of
the pay (settlement) period to meet the total MW ($3.35 x 200 - $670) due for
the hours worked during that month or pay period. At the end of the following
month, the salesperson has earned $1,000 in commissions. The employer deducts
from this amount the $170 that was paid the previous month to bring the
employee up to the MW. The employer pays the salesperson $670 ($3.35 x 200) and
carries the remaining $160 into the next month. This salesperson has also been
paid in compliance with FLSA. If the employer pays an additional amount ($170
the first month) to satisfy the MW, this amount may be recovered from excess
commissions earned but not paid in subsequent pay (settlement) periods.
Similarly, commissions earned but not paid in a given pay (settlement) period
which are in excess of the amount required to satisfy MW requirements may be
carried forward and applied to the MW on subsequent pay (settlement) dates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
d.     A
salesperson is paid four weekly draws of $150 each for a total of $600 for the
monthly pay (settlement) period. At the end of the month, the salesperson’s
commission earnings total $1,000. The employer deducts the $600 in draws from
this amount and pays the remainder (or excess) of $400 to the salesperson. The
following month, the salesperson is paid $600 in draws and earns no
commissions. To meet the MW obligation for the salesperson, the employer
applies $70 from the $400 excess earned and paid the previous month. This practice
is not in compliance with the requirements of FLSA. Any part of a commission
that is actually paid to the employee may not be carried forward as a credit
into subsequent pay (settlement) periods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
e.     Assume
the same 50-hour week and that the employer has definitely established a weekly
pay period and has a monthly settlement period. The salesperson draws $150 a
week against earned commissions. This salesperson has not been paid in
compliance with FLSA since this individual is not receiving the MW for all
hours worked in the pay period (50 x $3.35 - $167.50).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Note: In example
“e”, the pay period is one week; in example “a”, the pay period is one month.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30b06 - Payment of MW to seamen on American vessels.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Section
6(a)(4) of FLSA permits an employer to calculate wages for seamen on the basis
of a period longer than a w/w. For example, wages for such employees may be
calculated over a longer period, such as for the entire voyage, on a monthly
basis, or, in appropriate cases, on a yearly basis. In those cases where wages
are calculated on other than a weekly basis, it is the responsibility of the
employer to demonstrate that a pay period of such duration is in accordance
with the established custom of the industry. In addition, the employee must
receive wages at not less than a rate which will provide, for the period
covered by the wage payments, wages equal to the MW for all hours during such
period when the employee is on duty. Thus, if a seaman is paid a monthly
salary, the total hours worked in the month, divided into the salary, must
yield at least the MW, regardless of the varying number of hours worked during
the weeks in the month. The same principle would apply if the wages were
computed on the basis of an entire voyage or on a yearly basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   It is the
custom of some employers in the maritime industry to pay by the month or by the
voyage but, for the convenience of the employees, to make two or more partial
payments rather than a single payment covering the period involved. For example,
monthly compensation may be disbursed in two partial payments (semi-monthly),
or partial payments may be made weekly on the basis of 1/52nd of the annual pay
derived by multiplying 12 times the monthly salary. Such arrangements do not
affect the principles stated in (a) above.</p>

<h3>30b07 - Crediting a bonus or other payments to a MW deficiency.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   A bonus
or other payment which would not be considered a part of the regular rate may
not be offset against the MW due under FLSA. However, where such payments would
be considered a part of the regular rate, they are included with other wages
for purposes of determining compliance with the MW provisions of FLSA. (See IB
778.208 - 209.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Situations
may be encountered where the wages paid on the regular payday are not
sufficient to satisfy the MW, but the employee at some subsequent date is paid
additional wages (for example, a production bonus) for those w/w’s included in
the bonus payment period. When the additional wages are added to the wages paid
on the regular payday, the results are either that the employee has received
not less than the MW for each hour worked during that week or that the amount
of the MW deficiency has been reduced. In such situations, a monetary violation
of the MW provisions exists since payment of not less than the MW required by
FLSA must be made on the regular payday for each w/w (see FOH 30b04). However,
where the additional wages for a particular w/w have actually been paid prior
to the investigation, and they are sufficient to bring the employee’s wages up
to the MW for each hour worked during that week, no MW violation shall be
reported for that w/w. If such additional wages paid prior to the investigation
are not sufficient to bring the employee’s earnings up to the MW for each hour
worked during that week, the amount of the remaining MW deficiency shall be
computed and reported. The employer shall be advised that no less than the MW
must be paid on each regular payday and the employer’s assurance of future
compliance shall be obtained.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30b08 - Certain subsistence allowances not to be considered wages.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Governmental
subsistence allowances to veterans for vocational training or to disabled
handicapped veterans, as well as allowances furnished by a State to civilians
for rehabilitation, are not considered wages and may not be used by the
employer to offset wages which the employee is entitled to receive under the
law.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   No part
of a veteran’s basic pension award or other grants made by the Veterans
Administration during a veteran’s training period may be considered as wages
paid by the employer.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30b09 - (Reserved.)</h3>
<p> </p>

<h3>30b10 - State or Territorial MW higher than Federal MW.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   If no OT
has been worked in a w/w, no attempt shall be made to enforce a State or
Territorial minimum wage which is in excess of that provided in Acts enforced
by WH. However, the appropriate authorities shall be notified of the underpayment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Should OT
have been worked, the regular rate of pay cannot be lower than the applicable
State, Territorial, or Federal minimum, whichever is higher. (See FOH 32j01.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30b11 - PCA MW.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>All covered employees performing work on a
contract which is subject to PCA must be paid the MW of at least $3.35 per hour
for all hours spent in such contract work. (See Reg 41 CFR Part 50-202.2.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30b12 - Annual salary earned in shorter period - MW.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Certain employment, such as that in schools,
does not normally constitute 12 months of actual work each year. For the
convenience of the employee, the annual salary earned during the duty months is
often paid in equal monthly installments throughout the entire year. In
determining whether the statutory MW has been paid in such cases, the annual
salary is considered in relation to the duty months rather than in relation to
the entire year. Thus, for example, a school bus driver may receive an annual
salary of $6,000 for 10 months’ duty but be paid twelve equal monthly
installments of $500 each. In such case, the employee is considered as being
paid at the salary rate of $600 per month or $138.46 per week. Compliance with
the statutory MW is determined in the usual manner based on this weekly salary.
(See FOH 22b11 and 32b08.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30b13 - MW rate applicable to public agency
employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Individuals employed by a public agency are
subject to the FLSA MW standard, including Federal non-appropriated fund
employees who are subject to Sec 6(a)(l) pursuant to Sec 18 of FLSA. WH has no
authority under FLSA for the enforcement of the provisions of Sec 18; such
matters are within the authority of the Office of Personnel Management. Section
5341 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code requires the Sec 6(a)(1) rate for prevailing
rate system (so called “blue collar” or Wage Board) Federal employees.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30b14 - Minimum rates due domestic service employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Domestic
service employees are within FLSA coverage by virtue of Sec 6(f).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Under Sec
6(f)(l), an employee must receive cash wages of at least $50 in a calendar
quarter from a single employer; for purposes of this test only, cash wages
received from a single employer are counted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Pursuant
to Sec 3(m) and Reg 531, the reasonable cost to an employer of board, lodging,
or other facilities customarily furnished to employees is considered part of
wages for purposes of FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Employers
are responsible for determining whether persons they employ in domestic service
are covered under FLSA, that is, whether they work more than 8 hours per week
in the aggregate for one or more employers, or whether they have sufficient
earnings to qualify. This may require asking the employee about domestic
service with other employers.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30b15 - MW under Sec 7(k) - work period.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The work period chosen pursuant to Sec 7(k)
(see Reg 553.230), rather than the w/w, is to be treated as the unit for MW
purposes. The employee’s total compensation for the work period is divided by
the total number of hours worked in the work period to determine compliance
with the MW provisions of FLSA, notwithstanding that in particular days or
weeks within the work period the employee’s earnings do not yield the MW for
such shorter periods.</p>

<h3>30c00 - Method of payment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Wages may
take the form of cash or facilities as defined in Reg 531. An employer who
claims furnished facilities (meals, lodging, or other) as wages must maintain
the records required in Reg 516.27.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The
payment of wages through direct deposit into an employee’s bank account is an
acceptable method of payment, provided employees have the option of receiving
payment by cash or check directly from the employer. As an alternative, the
employer may make arrangements for employees to cash a check drawn against the
employer’s payroll deposit account, if it is at a place convenient to their
employment and without charge to them.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30c01 - “Facilities” furnished under Sec 3(m).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Section
3(m) of FLSA permits an employer, under conditions specified in Reg 531, to
count toward its MW obligation, the “reasonable cost” of furnishing board,
lodging, or other facilities which are customarily furnished to employees. Sec
3(m) also authorizes the Secretary to determine the “fair value” of the board,
lodging, or other facilities based upon average cost to the employer or to
groups of employers similarly situated, or on the average value to groups of
employees. Where “reasonable cost” under Sec 3(m) has been established by an
employer and appears to be excessive in relation to the facilities furnished,
it will be necessary to ascertain whether the “fair value” of the facilities in
question is lower than the “reasonable cost”. If so, the employer must use the
“fair value” rather than the “reasonable cost” in determining its wage
obligation. In no case will the “fair value” be utilized where it is greater
than the “reasonable cost”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The cost
of board, lodging, or other facilities shall not be included as wages to the
extent excluded therefrom under the terms of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement applicable to the particular employee. In most cases, a determination
whether such an exclusion exists will be based upon the written provisions of
the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Employees
must receive the benefit of the facility for which the employer is taking a
wage credit. Moreover, the reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing board,
lodging, or other facilities (or the fair value thereof) must be included in
the employee’s R/R of pay for the purpose of computing OT pay.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30c02 - Customarily furnished.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The
reasonable cost of board, lodging, or other facilities may be considered as
part of the wage paid an employee only where “customarily furnished” to the
employee. This requirement is satisfied if either the facilities are furnished
regularly by the employer to its employees or if the same or similar facilities
are customarily furnished by other employers engaged in the same or similar
trade, business, or occupation in the same or similar communities. However,
“customarily furnished” does not require establishing an industry-wide practice
with regard to charges being made for facilities furnished to employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Facilities
furnished in violation of any Federal, State, or local law, ordinance, or
prohibition will not be considered facilities customarily furnished, (e.g.
housing that has been denied an occupancy permit, or which, after inspection,
results in MSPA/CMPs). Any question as to whether facilities are furnished in
violation of any law should be referred to the AA/OPO for resolution. Any such
referral should include a detailed discussion of the facts and a copy of the applicable
law.</p>

<h3>30c03 - Primarily for the benefit of the employee.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The
crediting by an employer of facilities furnished to employees as wages will
depend on whether such facilities are furnished primarily for the benefit or
convenience of the employee, as determined by WH. Where the primary benefit of
such facilities is to the employer’s business interest, credit will be denied.
The following are commonly viewed as furnished primarily for the benefit or
convenience of employees:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Meals</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meals furnished by the
employer are regarded as primarily for the benefit and convenience of the
employees. This rule does not apply, however, to the meal expenses incurred by
an employee while traveling away from home on the employer’s business. (See IB
778.217(b)(3).)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Lodging</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lodging, like meals,
is ordinarily considered for the benefit and convenience of the employee.
Circumstances may exist, however, where housing is of little benefit to
employees, as where an employer requires an employee to live on the employer’s
premises to meet some need of the employer, or where the employee must travel
away from home to further the employer’s business. In such circumstances, the
housing will be considered as primarily benefiting the employer. (Note: while
it may be to the employer’s advantage to provide such facilities at or near the
worksite, courts have consistently taken the view that the employer may take a
wage credit when the facilities are primarily for the benefit or convenience of
the employee.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Transportation</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     Transportation
furnished employees between their homes and work (i.e. normal, daily
home-to-work travel) where the travel time does not constitute hours worked is
generally an “other facility.” However, transportation which is an incident of
or necessary to the employment is not an “other facility.” (See FOH 30c13
regarding transportation of migrant and seasonal agricultural workers.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
b.     Transportation
furnished for normal home to work travel from a voluntary assembly point to a job
site and vice versa where the time does not constitute hours of work and the
transportation is primarily for the benefit of the employees is an “other
facility.” In contrast, travel to distant or remote job sites is normally for
the employer’s benefit and does not qualify as an “other facility.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     Cars
furnished by an employer to employees primarily for the personal transportation
use of the employees and not primarily for company business are “facilities”
for which a wage credit may be claimed by the employer. (See FOH 30c11
regarding demonstrators used by automobile salespersons.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Merchandise</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Goods or merchandise,
such as clothing and appliances, may be considered “other facilities” under Sec
3(m) and Reg 531. Only the actual cost to the employer (not necessarily the
retail cost) may be taken as a wage credit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Tuition
expenses</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tuition furnished to
an employee for courses or training for the individual’s own personal benefit
is a bona fide “facility” for which a wage credit may be taken, unless the
training is related to employment or is required to retain employment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Child care</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Child care facilities
which are furnished by an employer are bona fide “facilities” for which a wage
credit may be taken.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30c04 - Primarily for the benefit of the employer.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The following are examples of items not
considered bona fide “other facilities” under Sec 3(m) and Reg 531, because
they are provided primarily for the benefit or convenience of the employer:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     Electric
power used for commercial production in the interest of the employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     Telephones
used for business purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.     Taxes
and insurance on the employer’s building which is not used as lodging furnished
to the employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.     Medical
services and hospitalization which the employer is obligated to furnish under
workers’ compensation laws or similar Federal, State or local laws.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5.     Rental
of uniforms where the wearing of a uniform is required by law, the employer, or
by the nature of the work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6.     Business-related
travel expenses. (See IB 778.217.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>7.     Necessary
tools or uniforms used in the employee’s work.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30c05 - Reasonable cost of facilities.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   “Reasonable
cost” cannot exceed the actual cost to the employer. In deciding whether wage
credits for facilities are in amounts permissible under Sec 3(m) and Reg 531,
experience and judgment must be used by COs and ADs. It should be kept in mind
that the test in Reg 531.3 is “reasonable cost” rather than market value or
comparable prices. “Reasonable cost” does not include a profit to the employer.
The cost of furnishing lodging and/or other facilities must be established
based upon available records. The employer has the burden of establishing such
cost and must maintain adequate records to support a determination, as required
by Reg 516.27. Bills, purchase orders, and cash register tapes may be
appropriate for such purpose. A comparison of wage credits for comparable
facilities furnished by other employers in the area may also provide guidance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The
method used by an employer for determining “reasonable cost” must be based on
good accounting practices. Good accounting practices do not include accounting
practices which are not accepted by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Furthermore,
an employer may not take a credit where no cost is incurred. For example, when
a meal is made available to an employee, but is not consumed, and subsequently
is retained in the employer’s inventory for service to customers, no credit may
be taken.</p>

<h3>30c06 - Examples of determining reasonable cost.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Meals -
Food service establishments</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The “reasonable
cost” of meals furnished by a food service establishment to its employees
includes only the actual cost to the employer of the food, its preparation, and
related supplies. Salary or wage costs, as distinguished from material or
supply costs, may be claimed only to the extent that such salary or wage costs
are shown to be directly attributable to the cost of providing meals to
employees. If food preparation/serving employees of a food service
establishment would be paid the same rate of pay even if meals were not
provided to the employees of the establishment, their wage costs cannot be
included in determining reasonable cost. Conversely, if it were necessary to
hire extra personnel or pay higher wages to existing employees in order for
them to assist in furnishing meals to employees, such extra expense would be a
legitimate cost which could be included in determining the “reasonable cost” of
meals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Costs which a
food service employer incurs regardless of whether the employees were furnished
meals may not be included in determining the “reasonable cost.” In a food
service establishment, items such as employee insurance, payroll taxes, menus,
decorations, other operating supplies, laundry, telephone, maintenance
services, advertising and promotion, building and equipment rental, licenses
and taxes, insurance and depreciation, franchise cost, and general
administrative costs are a part of the overall cost of the operation of the
employer’s business establishment which may not be charged to the reasonable
cost of employees’ meals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Meals -
Non food service establishments</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Determination of the “reasonable cost” of meals
furnished to employees of an establishment which is not a food service
establishment involve different criteria for expenses for which an employer may
take credit. For example, where meals are provided to employees of a non
food-service establishment by a catering service and there are no special
facilities wherein meals are consumed, the actual cost of the catering service,
assuming no rebate to the employer, would be the “reasonable cost.” In more
complex situations where dining areas are provided, the factors discussed in
(a) above must be considered in making a determination of the “reasonable cost”
of meals furnished to employees of a non food-service establishment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Lodging</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employers taking credit for housing as part of
wages must show that the amounts charged are not more than the actual cost to
the employer. (See Reg 531.3(a).) However, if the actual cost of providing
lodging is more than its established rental value, the rental value shall be
deemed to be the reasonable cost of lodging. (See FOH 30c07.) The actual cost
to the employer generally involves the following factors:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Adequate
Depreciation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reg 531.3(c) allows
an employer to include “adequate depreciation” as an element of cost.
Depreciation is a concept primarily used in and extensively regulated under the
tax laws. Depreciation is applicable to certain capital goods (e.g. buildings,
vehicles, machines, etc.). It is never applicable to land. For purposes of Reg
531 “adequate depreciation” is not more than the amount of depreciation
actually claimed and allowed under the tax laws for the property in question
for the period in question. It should be noted that the amount of depreciation
allowable on any property may vary from year to year. If the employer declines
to provide tax returns or similar evidence as to the claim and allowance of
depreciation under the tax laws, no allowance will be made under Reg 531.3(c).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     For
tax purposes, depreciation might be claimed under several line items for
property involved in the furnishing of a facility. For example, an employer
furnishing lodging might properly claim the depreciation of the building at one
place; the depreciation of the beds at another; and the depreciation of linens
at another. The addition of several such items of depreciation could be
appropriate. Similarly, an employer might claim, in a single line item,
depreciation on a greater piece of property than is involved in furnishing the
facility in question. For example, the owner of a 20 unit motel who furnishes
one unit for the lodging of an employee might claim depreciation on the entire
motel building as a single line item. Under these circumstances, pro rata
allocation of the claimed depreciation would be required. In the example,
assuming no complications (e.g. no part of building used for other proposes;
all units equal size, etc.), the allowable depreciation would be 1/20 = 5
percent of the total depreciation taken.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
b.     For
tax purposes, depreciation is claimed by the year and can be prorated as
appropriate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Capital
Invested.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The computation of “a
reasonable allowance (not more than 5 1/2 percent) for interest on the
depreciated amount of capital invested by the employer” (as referred to in Reg
531.3(c)) is made as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 1: An amount, V,
represents the total depreciable value of the property to the employer. (See
(1) above. This number is not derived from or necessarily related to “fair
market value”.) Ordinarily, this will be the purchase price plus the cost of
capital improvements. It should be noted that no part of the cost of land is
included.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 2: Compute the
amount, A, by which the depreciable value, V, exceeds the depreciation already
taken (or which might have been taken) as a tax deduction (i.e., subtract total
allowable depreciation to date from V, the result is A.) This number is
required to be reported on the employer’s tax returns. If the employer declines
to make tax returns available for verification, then A shall be deemed to be
zero. If A = 0, no further computation is required; the allowance for this part
is zero.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 3: Determine the
amount, E, of the employer’s equity in V. This would ordinarily be the sum of the
down payment, portions of mortgage payments applied toward principal, and the
cash contribution toward any capital improvements included in V.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 4: Compute (E/V)
times (A). Conceptually, this is the portion of the equity which has not been
“returned” to the employer through depreciation. A “reasonable allowance”,
i.e., a “return on investment” of up to 5 1/2 percent of this number, may be
included in the employer’s cost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Cost of
operation</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Annual costs of
operation incurred in furnishing lodging facilities must be considered in
making “reasonable cost” determinations: these include interest on loans to
purchase, maintain, or improve the lodging facility, taxes, repairs and
maintenance, insurance, and utilities (electricity, water, sewers, garbage collection,
fuel oil, and so forth.) Repair and maintenance expenses refer to the costs
which are not included under capital improvements. Only the portion of those
costs which are directly related to the lodging facility used by the
employee(s) may be taken into account in determining the actual cost of
providing the lodging. As an example, the cost of property insurance should be
prorated in proportion to the space of the lodging actually used by the
employee(s).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  When the
employer leases a property from another person, the amount of rent paid by the
employer to the other person is considered part of the “reasonable cost”
provided that the rent charged provides no profit for the employer, directly or
indirectly. As an example, if an employer pays a higher rental charge with the
promise of a rebate from the property owner as an encouragement to lease
certain lodging facilities, such higher rent payment may not be used as a
component of the “reasonable cost” for leasing the lodging facilities. The
allowable “reasonable cost” amount would be the rent paid by the employer minus
the amount of rebate promised and received by the employer from the property
owner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  When
determining the weekly “reasonable cost” of a lodging facility which may be
claimed as a wage credit, the sum of the annual costs (as determined in (1) and
(2) above) is divided by the number of weeks during which the lodging facility
is used for occupancy. Where the facility is used for other purposes, in
addition to lodging, the annual cost is first prorated among the uses. Once the
weekly “reasonable cost” amount has been determined, it should be divided by
the actual number of occupants in the lodging facility where each is provided
an equal amount of living area. However, if the living areas within the lodging
facility are not equal in size, the weekly “reasonable cost” amount should be
divided by the square feet of the dwelling. The wage credit which may be
claimed per employee in such cases shall be based upon the number of square
feet occupied by the employee and /or that individual’s family.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30c07 - Fair value of facilities.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In those cases where cost to the employer is
not a true measure of the value of the facilities to the employees, it may be
appropriate to apply the “fair value” provisions of Sec 3(m). “Fair value” is
not synonymous with “reasonable cost.” The “fair value” of a facility allowable
under Sec 3(m) as wages may be utilized in lieu of the actual measure of cost
in determining the wages paid to any employee. Such a determination is
authorized for defined classes of employees and in defined areas based on
average cost or average value. To obtain a determination of “fair value”, the
facts specified in Reg 531.4 and 531.5 should be obtained and the issues
submitted to the AA/OPO.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30c08 - Formal determinations of “reasonable cost” and “fair value” of
facilities.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Regs 531.4 and 531.5 set forth the procedures
to be followed in making a formal determination of “reasonable cost” or “fair
value” as these terms are used in Sec 3(m), whether initiated by the Adm or any
interested person. When such a request is made, the petitioner should be
informed of the procedures and instructed to forward the request and required
information to the Adm.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30c09 - Facilities - voluntary and uncoerced.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An employer
may credit against cash wages owed employees the lesser of “reasonable cost” or
“fair value”, in accordance with Reg 531 and the principles in FOH 30c01 -
30c08, of facilities regularly provided to employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Reg
531.30 provides that an employee’s acceptance of facilities must be “voluntary
and uncoerced.” The “voluntary and uncoerced” provision has been rejected in
several court of appeals and district court decisions regarding meals provided
to employees. WH no longer enforces the “voluntary” provision with respect to
meals. Therefore, where an employee is required to accept a meal provided by
the employer as a condition of employment, WH will take no enforcement action,
provided that the employer takes credit for no more than the actual cost
incurred. (See FOH 30c05 and 30c06).</p>

<h3>30c10 - Voluntary assignment of wages, loans, and advances.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Although
sums paid by an employer under voluntary assignment of an employee to a third
party for the benefit of the employee are not bona fide “facilities”, they may
be deducted from the employee’s wages provided the employer does not directly
or indirectly benefit. Deductions for “administrative” or “bookkeeping
expenses” incurred by the employer in connection with such payments, however,
are illegal to the extent that they cut into the MW or OT pay due under FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   While
loans and cash advances made by an employer are not “facilities” the principal
may be deducted from the employee’s wages even where such a deduction cuts into
the MW or OT due under FLSA. Deductions for interest or administrative costs on
the loan or advance are illegal to the extent that they cut into the MW or OT
pay. The existence of the loan or advance shall be verified to the extent
possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   In the
situation where an employee is granted vacation pay prior to that individual’s
anniversary date, or the established date of entitlement, with the
understanding that such pay constitutes an advance of pay and the employee
quits or is terminated before the entitlement date, the employer may recoup the
advanced vacation pay, even where such recoupment cuts into the MW or OT pay
required under FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30c11 - Demonstrators - automobile salespersons.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Transportation which the employer provides to
an employee is not furnished as a “facility” for purposes of Sec 3(m) if it is
an incident of and necessary to the employment or if the transportation is
furnished for travel by the employee which constitutes hours worked compensable
under FLSA (Reg 531.32(a) and (c).) Demonstrators which are provided to
automobile salespersons for their personal use as a form of advertising are not
primarily for the benefit of employees and do not constitute wages under FLSA.
This is true notwithstanding the fact that IRS may require employers to treat
as taxable income any portion of the benefit received by the employee.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30c12 - Cost of furnishing and maintaining uniforms.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Where
uniforms are required by law, employer, or type of work</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the wearing of clean uniforms is required by
law, by the employer, or by the nature of the work, the financial burden of
furnishing or maintaining these clean uniforms may not be imposed upon the
employees if to do so would reduce their wages below the MW (see Reg
531.3(d)(2), 531.32(c) and 531.35).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Cost of
and time spent in maintaining uniforms</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Where employee
uniforms require ironing, drycleaning, daily washing, commercial laundering, or
other special treatment, because of heavy soiling in work usage or in order to
meet cleanliness or appearance standards set by law, by an employer, or by the
nature of the work, the employees must, absent documentation of the greater or
lesser cost, be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs which reduce their
wages below the MW in accordance with the amounts set forth in (b)(3) below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  However, in
those instances where uniforms are (a) made of “wash and wear” materials, (b)
may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and (c) do not
require ironing or any other special treatment such as drycleaning, daily
washing, or commercial laundering, WH will not require that employees be
reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. This position is not applicable where
daily washing is required and the employer furnishes or reimburses the employee
for a single uniform.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  For enforcement
purposes, WH will accept the payment to the employee of $3.35 per week or 67
cents per day as satisfying this requirement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Since the
uniform cost would presumably be the same for any day, regardless of the number
of hours worked, allocating this cost on an hourly basis should be avoided
except as in (d)(2) below. However, if an employer pays on a “cents-per-hour”
basis, no monetary violation will exist if the employees receive the full daily
and/or weekly amounts in each w/w as indicated in (3) above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Where this
enforcement position is followed, the time spent in washing uniforms will not
be considered hours worked for either MW or OT pay purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Employers or
employees are free to establish actual costs, as indicated in (d) below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Employee
chooses not to use employer’s free laundry service</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where an employer gives notice to employees
that the employer will launder or clean all uniforms required to be worn by
employees, free of any charge, and all or some employees elect not to avail
themselves of such service, the employer will not be required to reimburse the
employees for expenses incurred by them for laundering or cleaning their
uniforms on their own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Other
standards for determination of cost</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The enforcement
position in (b)(3) above does not prohibit the determination of the cost of
laundering or maintaining uniforms from being made on some other basis, so long
as the actual cost does not cut into required MW or OT compensation. For
example, where an employer contracts with a laundry or rental service and in
turn charges the employees or requires the employees to bear the cost directly,
the actual cost may be used if reasonable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Similarly,
where a specific amount has been negotiated under a bona fide collective
bargaining agreement (e.g., 5c for each hour worked), this amount may be used,
if reasonable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Where the
employer does not use the flat daily or weekly basis set forth in subsec (b)(3)
above, it is essential that the CO determine and document in the case file the
actual cost incurred by the employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  In preparing a
case for settlement or for litigation, the enforcement position in subsec
(b)(3) cannot be relied upon as a basis for action where the employer uses
another basis for reimbursing employees for uniform maintenance expenses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Cost of
purchasing and repurchasing uniforms</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  When an
employee is required to purchase a uniform, the employee must be reimbursed for
the cost of the uniform to the extent that the expense cuts into the MW or OT
compensation required by FLSA/PCA/SCA/CWHSSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  This
reimbursement must be made promptly on the regular payday for the w/w in which
the expense was incurred and may not be spread over the life of the garment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Further,
employers may not avoid such costs by requiring employees to obtain uniforms
before starting the job. In such a case, the cost of the uniform is, in effect,
an advance of an expense that must be borne by the employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  On the other
hand, where an employee already has a uniform which has been paid for by the
firm, and the employee is paid at least the MW and proper OT and there is a
clear understanding between the employer and the employee that so much per hour
will be paid in addition to the MW for the sole purpose of replacing an
existing uniform, and, in fact, the amount so paid is sufficient to purchase
replacement uniforms when worn out or no longer serviceable, no violation would
occur.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Definition
of “uniforms”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Although there
are no hard-and-fast rules in determining whether certain types of dress are
considered uniforms for purposes of Sec 3(m), the following principles are
applicable:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     If
an employer merely prescribes a general type of ordinary basic street clothing
to be worn while working and permits variations in details of dress, the
garments chosen by the employees would not be considered to be uniforms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
b.     On
the other hand, where the employer does prescribe a specific type and style of
clothing to be worn at work, e.g. where a restaurant or hotel requires a tuxedo
or a skirt and blouse or jacket of a specific or distinctive style, color, or
quality, such clothing would be considered uniforms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     Other
examples would include uniforms required to be worn by guards, cleaning and
culinary personnel, and hospital and nursing home personnel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Employee
elects to buy additional uniforms. in excess of number required</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where an employer supplies, free of charge, or
reimburses the employees for a sufficient number of uniforms required to be
worn, and all or some employees elect to purchase additional uniforms in excess
of the number required, the employer will not be required to reimburse the
employees for costs incurred in purchasing uniforms in excess of the required
number.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)  For the
application of these principles on uniforms under SCA, see FOH 14f01 and Reg
4.168(b).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30c13 - Deductions from wages of migrant and seasonal agricultural workers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The
reasonable cost or fair value of facilities furnished a migrant or seasonal
agricultural worker are generally creditable as wages. (However, see FOH
30c03.) Examples of facilities for which deductions or credits are generally
permissible include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Meals and
beverages actually furnished to the worker.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Off-the-job
insurance authorized by the worker.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Canteen
articles purchased by the worker, but not cigarettes or alcoholic beverages
sold to the worker, if such sales are determined to be unlawful by appropriate
local law enforcement authorities. Apparent violations of State or local
licensing laws should be referred promptly to the appropriate enforcement
authority. (See FOH 52a09, 53g03 and 54: WH-124.) Prior to disallowing a
deduction or wage credit based upon action by a State or local authority
concerning illegal sales, the matter should be discussed through JRC
procedures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Lodging used by
a worker, including utility costs, unless required to be provided free of
charge pursuant to the employment contract or applicable law. However, no
credit may be taken nor may any charge be made where:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     workers
are required to live on the premises as a condition of employment or where for
other reasons the housing primarily benefits the employer rather than the
employee, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
b.     the
housing has been denied an occupancy permit because of failure to meet
substantive S &amp; H standards as determined by an inspection by any agency,
or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     S
&amp; H violations have been found for which MSPA CMPs are being assessed or
violations of substantive S &amp; H standards have been found by OSHA, a State,
or county agency. If the violations are corrected, a charge may be made or a
credit taken for such lodging only during the period of compliance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   ETA
regulations require that workers placed pursuant to a Job Service clearance
order who are unable to return daily to their permanent residence must receive
housing as a term and condition of their employment. Such workers (and
accompanying family members) must receive housing at no cost or public housing
which meets the Federal and State standards (20 CFR 653.501(d)(2)(xv)). Where
it appears that a deduction has been made or a wage credit taken in apparent
violation of ETA regulations, the matter should be reviewed through JRC before
disallowing the deduction or wage credit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   An
employer who makes deductions from the wages of workers for board, lodging or
other facilities or who furnishes such facilities to workers as additions to
wages is required to maintain records substantiating the cost of such
facilities in accordance with Reg 516.27.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   In
Marshall v. Glassboro Service Association. Inc., the Third Circuit affirmed the
district court’s judgment that money advanced to farm workers for transportation
costs from Puerto Rico to the mainland was primarily for the benefit of the
employer and therefore could not be deducted from the workers’ wages to the
extent it reduced the wages below the statutory minimum. The court similarly
upheld the district court’s conclusion that FLSA prohibits the employer from
taking a wage credit for facilities excluded from wages by the terms of a labor
agreement which is the functional equivalent of a collective-bargaining
agreement. The U.S. Supreme Court denied review. The Court of Appeals also
ruled that, regardless of the manner or method by which the employer sought to
pass on to its employees certain transportation costs, where the effect was to
bring the wage rate below the statutory minimum, such practice was unlawful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   It is the
WH position that no deduction that cuts into the MW may be made for
transportation of migrant workers from the point of hire and return to that
point. This is so since in virtually all situations the transportation is
primarily for the benefit of the employer and transportation costs are an
incident of and necessary to the employment of migrant workers. Where an
employer advances money to migrant workers to cover transportation expenses
from the point of hire to a worksite, the employer may not recoup such advances
when to do so results in a worker receiving less than the statutory MW. Such
remains the case even though the transportation costs so recovered are
accumulated and subsequently returned to the worker at some specified time during
the season or upon the worker’s return to the point of hire, after the
individual has worked a full season or specified portion thereof. Further, such
transportation costs may not be included as part of an employer’s cost of
furnishing board, lodging, or other facilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Farm
labor contractors and agricultural associations often provide daily
transportation to both migrant and seasonal farmworkers as an integral part of
their business of supplying agricultural workers to those who use their farm labor
contracting services. Agricultural employers also transport their own workers
under similar circumstances. Such daily transportation is provided to assure
that sufficient workers will be available at the required time and place since
the workers being transported are needed to work upon perishable commodities.
Their availability for employment often depends upon being provided
transportation. Where alternative transportation is readily available which the
workers are permitted to use (i.e., personal auto or carpool arrangements) and
where they know the location of the place where they are to work, the
reasonable cost to an employer (or fair value, whichever is less) in providing
transportation may be creditable towards wages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In contrast, where furnishing transportation to
workers is primarily for the benefit and convenience of the employer, and is
necessary to and an incident of the employment, it is not considered a facility
within the meaning of section 3(m). (See Reg 531.32(a) and (c).) Accordingly,
it is the WH position that:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Where the
transportation is an incident of and necessary to the employment, it is for the
benefit of the employer and no deduction may be made for the transportation of
migrant or seasonal farmworkers that cuts into the MW. For example,
transportation of migrant or seasonal farmworkers from the pickup point and
return to that point, or from the temporary labor camp to the fields or for the
return trip is transportation that is an incident of and necessary to the
employment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Where the
transportation is not incidental to the employment, it is for the worker’s
benefit and deductions may be made which cut into the MW, provided that if such
transportation is subject to MSPA it must be furnished in vehicles which meet
all substantive Federal and State motor vehicle safety and insurance standards.
Transportation which is not incidental to the employment (and thus deductible)
includes:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     the
transportation of migrant workers to conduct personal business, such as trips
from the rural temporary labor camp to a laundry, post office, and grocery
store, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
b.     the
daily transportation of migrant and seasonal farmworkers, where alternative
transportation is readily available, which the workers have the option to use,
and they know where to report to work but choose to use the employer’s
transportation, provided that the transportation is not required to be
furnished by law or regulation.</p>

<h3>30c14  Employees’ taxes paid by employer may constitute “wages”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Pursuant
to Reg 531.38, taxes which are assessed against an employee and which are
collected by the employer and paid to the appropriate government agency may
constitute “wages”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The same
principle applies to taxes which, although owed by the employee, are paid by
the employer. Thus, an employer may pay an employee’s share of social security
(FICA) taxes. Such payment constitutes “wages” and may therefore be credited
toward the MW and OT requirements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Where an
employee receives the MW of $3.35, the employer and the employee must each make
an FICA contribution of 24 cents an hour ($3.35 x .0715 = .2395). (7.15 percent
is the current FICA rate which is, of course, subject to change.)</p>

<h3>30c15 - Car expenses - employee’s use of personal car on employer’s
business.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In some cases it is necessary to determine the
costs involved when employees use their cars on their employer’s business in
order to determine MW compliance. For example, car expenses are frequently an
issue for delivery drivers employed by pizza or other carry-out type
restaurants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   As an
enforcement policy, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) standard business
mileage rate found in IRS Publication 917, “Business Use of a Car” may be used
(in lieu of actual costs and associated recordkeeping) to determine or evaluate
the employer’s wage payment practices for FLSA purposes. The IRS standard
business mileage rate (currently 28 cents per mile) represents depreciation,
maintenance and repairs, gasoline (including taxes), oil, insurance, and
vehicle registration fees. In situations where the IRS rate changes during the
investigation period, the applicable rates should be applied on a pro-rate
basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The IRS
standard business mileage rate may be used in lieu of actual costs for FLSA
purposes whether or not the employee will be able to take a deduction on his or
her tax return for the business use of the employee’s car.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30c16 - Deductions in non-overtime weeks.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Deductions for article that do not qualify as
“board, lodging, or other facilities” under FLSA section 3(m), such as tools,
equipment, cash register shortages, and other similar items, may be made in
non-OT workweeks (i.e.,. weeks of 40 hours or less, and weeks in which
statutory OT does not apply) provided the employee continues to receive, after
the deductions are made, any required MW, free and clear, for all compensable
hours worked in the week (i.e., average hourly earnings for the workweek after
the deductions are not less than the highest applicable MW enforced by WH). 
(See Regs 531.35 and 531.36.) Deductions for non-3(m) items that cut into the
highest applicable MW enforced by WH are illegal in a non-OT workweek unless
the law establishing that MW (e.g., DBRA, SCA, H-2A, H-1B, etc.) allows the
particular deduction from wages.  NOTE: If a MSPA contract specifically
discloses that the employer will make certain particularized deductions not
otherwise prohibited by other law, those deductions would be permitted. For
example, if a MSPA-covered employer disclosed a wage rate of $8.00/hour and
fully disclosed in writing at the time of recruitment that $1.50/hour would be
deducted for non-3(m) items, and the deductions are otherwise legal and not
prohibited by other applicable laws, then those fully-disclosed deductions are
permitted to reduce the hourly wage to below the $8.00/hour contracted
“promised wage” (i.e., to $6.50/hour). Furthermore, various other Federal,
State and local laws regulate payment of wages, prohibit or restrict payment of
wages in services or facilities, outlaw “kickbacks,” restrain assignments, and
otherwise govern the calculation of wages and frequency and manner of paying
them. Nothing in the FLSA or other WH-administered statutes, regulations, or interpretations
overrides or nullifies any higher standards or more-stringent provisions of
these other laws. (See Reg. 531.26.) (WH enforcement in non-OT workweeks is
limited to the highest applicable MW enforced by WH, which includes WH-enforced
prevailing wages when they apply (e.g., DBRA, SCA, H-1B, etc.).) If no OT has
been worked in a particular week, WH will not enforce any other State of local
MW higher than the highest MW applicable under the laws enforced by WH; the Inv
will advise the employer of the apparent violation of such other higher MW
standards and notify the appropriate authorities of the employer’s deductions
policies and possible underpayments that may have occurred. (See FOH 30b10.) Permissible
deductions in an OT week are discussed in FOH 32j08.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b>&lt;h3&gt;30d - TIPS AND TIPPED EMPLOYEES&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<h3>30d00  General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Tipped
employees are subject to the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.  Section 3(m) of the
FLSA permits an employer to claim a partial credit against its minimum wage
obligation to a tipped employee based on tips received by the employee.  This
credit against wages due is called a “tip credit.”  29 CFR Part 531 contains
further guidance on this topic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Section
3(m) of FLSA makes clear the intent of Congress to place on the employer the
burden of proving the amount of tips received by tipped employees and the
amount of tip credit, if any, which the employer may claim.  The employer may
not claim a tip credit greater than the tips received.  If the direct (or cash)
wage paid plus the tips received is less than the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage,
the employer is required to pay the balance so that the employee receives at
least the minimum wage with the combination of wages and tips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The
language of Sec. 3(m) was amended by the Small Business Job Protection Act of
1996.  Effective August 20, 1996, Sec. 3(m) provides:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In determining the
wage an employer is required to pay a tipped employee, the amount paid such
employee by the employee’s employer shall be an amount equal to – (1) the cash
wage paid such employee which for purposes of such determination shall not be
less than the cash wage required to be paid such an employee on August 20,
1996; and (2) an additional amount on account of the tips received by such
employee which amount is equal to the difference between the wage specified in
paragraph (1) and the wage in effect under section 206(a)(1) of this title. 
The additional amount on account of tips may not exceed the value of the tips
actually received by an employee.  The preceding two sentences shall not apply
with respect to any tipped employee unless such employee has been informed by
the employer of the provisions of this subsection, and all tips received by
such employee have been retained by the employee, except that this subsection
shall not be construed to prohibit the pooling of tips among employees who
customarily and regularly receive tips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Tip
credit principles</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As amended in 1996, Sec. 3(m) limits the tip
credit an employer may claim to &quot;the difference between the wage specified
in paragraph (1) and the wage in effect under section 206(a)(1).”  Thus, the
tip credit is &quot;capped&quot; at the difference between the Sec. 6(a)(1)
wage and the direct or cash wage paid.  The cash wage paid may not be less than
the cash wage required to be paid a tipped employee on August 20, 1996, which
was $2.13 per hour.   Because Sec. 3(m) limits the tip credit to the difference
between the cash wage paid and the federal minimum wage, for purposes of the
FLSA, employees who are paid using the tip credit are paid the minimum wage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 531.50</p>
<p>(1)  Definition of
Tipped Employee</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A “tipped employee”,
as defined in Sec. 3(t) of the FLSA, is any employee engaged in an occupation
in which the individual customarily and regularly receives more than $30.00 a
month in tips.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although some states
define “tipped employee” differently, the definition in Sec. 3(t) is used for
FLSA enforcement purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tip provisions apply
on an individual employee basis. An employer may claim the tip credit for some
employees even though the employer cannot meet the requirements for others. (Rev.
563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 531.50(b)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Tips are the
property of the employee</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A tip is a sum
presented by a customer to the tipped employee as a gift or gratuity in
recognition of some service performed for him.  Section 3(m) sets forth the
only ways in which an employer can use its employee's tips: as a partial credit
against its minimum wage obligations, or through a valid tip pool (defined in
FOH 30d04).  These restrictions on an employer's use of its employees' tips
apply even when the employer has not taken a tip credit.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 531.52</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Notice
requirement</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer cannot take
a tip credit unless it informs the tipped employee of the provisions of Sec.
3(m) and allows the tipped employee to retain all tips, except to the extent
the employee participates in a valid tip pooling arrangement.  Where an
employer does not inform the tipped employee of the use of the tip credit, the
full minimum wage is due, no tip credit will be allowed, and the employee must
retain all tips received.  See FOH 30d01(c).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 531.59(b)
states that the employer must inform its tipped employees, in advance of taking
the tip credit, of the following requirements in Section 3(m):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     The
amount of the cash wage that is to be paid to the tipped employee by the
employer, which may not be less than $2.13 per hour,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
b.     The
additional amount by which the wages of the tipped employee are increased on
account of the tip credit claimed by the employer,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     The
amount of the tip credit claimed may not exceed the value of the tips actually
received by the employee,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
d.     All
tips received by the tipped employee must be retained by the employee except
for a valid tip pooling arrangement limited to employees who customarily and
regularly receive tips,  and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
e.     The
tip credit shall not apply to any employee who has not been informed of these
provisions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Dual Jobs</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  When an individual
is employed in a tipped occupation and a non-tipped occupation – for example,
as a server and janitor (dual jobs) -- the tip credit is available only for the
hours spent in the tipped occupation, provided such employee customarily and
regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips. (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)  29
CFR 531.56(e).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  29 CFR
531.56(e) permits the employer to take a tip credit for time spent in duties
related to the tipped occupation of an employee, even though such duties are
not by themselves directed toward producing tips, provided such related duties
are incidental to the regular duties of the tipped employees and are generally
assigned to the tipped employee.  For example, duties related to the
tipped occupation may include a server who does preparatory or closing
activities, rolls silverware and fills salt and pepper shakers while the
restaurant is open, cleans and sets tables, makes coffee, and occasionally
washes dishes or glasses.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  However, where
the facts indicate that tipped employees spend a substantial amount of time (in
excess of 20 percent of the hours worked in the tipped occupation in the
workweek) performing such related duties, no tip credit may be taken for the
time spent in those duties.  All related duties count toward the 20
percent tolerance.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Likewise, an
employer may not take a tip credit for the time that a tipped employee spends
on work that is not related to the tipped occupation.  For example,
maintenance work (e.g., cleaning bathrooms and washing windows) are not related
to the tipped occupation of a server; such jobs are non-tipped
occupations.  In this case, the employee is effectively employed in dual
jobs.    </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30d01 - Retention of tips by employee.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   As noted
above, tips are the property of the tipped employee who receives them whether
or not the employer claims a tip credit. Pursuant to Sec. 3(m), all tips
received (i.e., given to or designated for the employee by a patron) by a
“tipped employee” must be retained by the employee and the employer may only
utilize the employee’s tips as a partial credit against its minimum wage
obligation or in furtherance of a valid pooling arrangement. An employer and
employee cannot agree to waive such employee’s right to retain all tips received.
A tipped employee must retain all tips received from customers and in addition,
where the employer claims a tip credit, the employee must receive a direct or
cash wage from the employer at a rate of at least $2.13 per hour and must
receive at least enough in tips to equal the minimum wage when combined with
the direct wage.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Tips the
employee receives in excess of the permissible tip credit are not considered
“wages.”  Where an employer has claimed a tip credit, under the FLSA it has
paid the employee only the federal minimum wage regardless of the amount of
tips received by the employee in excess of the tip credit amount.  Because the
employee has only received the minimum wage (through the direct or cash wage
and tip credit), any deductions by the employer for non-Sec. 3(m) items such as
uniform costs, cash register shortages, and meal walkouts would result in a
violation of the employer’s minimum wage obligation because it would reduce the
total compensation to less than the Sec. 6(a)(1) wage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Where an
employer does not strictly observe the provisions of Sec. 3(m), no tip credit
may be claimed and the employees are entitled to receive the full cash minimum
wage, in addition to retaining all tips they may have received. For example,
where an employer does not fulfill its obligation under 29 CFR 531.59(b) to
inform its tipped employees of the provisions of section 3(m), or pays no wages
to employees who receive tips, the full minimum wage in cash is due and no tip
credit will be allowed.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)  In addition, the employee must
retain all tips received.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  WHD will not
allow an employer to claim the tip credit on a retroactive basis where the
employer has not met the requirements for taking a tip credit.  For example, an
employer who pays no wages (i.e., employees received only tips) will be
required to pay the full minimum wage and will not be able to claim a tip
credit.  This same principle applies when the employer pays some cash wage but
less than the minimum required cash wage; for example, where the employer pays
a cash wage of $2.00 per hour the employer will be required to pay the full
minimum wage (offset by the $2.00 payment) and will not be able to claim a tip
credit.  Similarly, employers who require tipped employees to participate in
invalid tip pooling arrangements (FOH 30d04) will be required to restore the
tips to the employees and pay the full minimum wage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Employee
retention of tips when no tip credit is claimed</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tips are property of
the employee even in situations where the employer takes no tip credit.  For
example, an employer who is prohibited by state law from taking a tip credit
and pays its employees the full minimum wage is prohibited from using its
employees’ tips other than in furtherance of a valid tip pool.  An employer
that does not take a tip credit would be in violation of the FLSA if it
requires its tipped employees to participate in an invalid tip pool that
includes individuals who do not &quot;customarily and regularly receive tips&quot;
under the terms of the statute, such as dishwashers and cooks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHD will not enforce
the policy on ownership of tips under the FLSA prior to February 29, 2012, for
employers in the Ninth Circuit who did not take a tip credit.  See Field
Assistance Bulletin No. 2012-1 (Feb. 29, 2012).  This enforcement position does
not limit the rights of any employee in the Ninth Circuit to bring a private
action under Sec. 16(b).  The Ninth Circuit is comprised of the states of
California, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Hawaii, and
Arizona.  </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30d02 - Tip credits in special minimum wage and sub minimum wage
situations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Special minimum wages authorized under Sec.14
of FLSA are considered to be the “applicable minimum wage” in determining
amounts creditable toward the minimum wage for tips for purposes of Sec. 3(m). 
Thus, for example where an employee is subject to a SMW of $6.00 per hour, the
maximum permissible tip credit would be $3.87 ($6.00 SMW - $2.13 direct or cash
wage).  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>
<h4> </h4>

<h3>30d03 - Service charges.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A compulsory service charge (generally noted on
the menu) which is added to a customer’s bill is not part of the server’s
(waiters/waitresses) tip income but, rather, is included with the employer’s
gross receipts. Therefore, the employer has complete discretion in choosing the
manner in which the compulsory service charge is used, which would include
using it to pay servers and/or server helpers (busboys/busgirls). Where service
charges are imposed and the employees receive no tips, the employees are not
“tipped employees” and the employer must pay the entire minimum wage and
overtime required by FLSA.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)  If, in addition to service
charge income, the servers receive tips from customers, such tip income may be
credited toward the minimum wage in the usual manner if the employee qualifies
as a tipped employee and the employer has met all obligations to claim a tip
credit.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>30d04 - Tip pooling.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The
requirement that an employee must retain all tips does not preclude tip-splitting
or pooling arrangements among employees who customarily and regularly receive
tips.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)  Employer-required, or mandatory, tip pools may only
include employees who customarily and regularly receive tips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The
following occupations have been recognized as those in which employees
customarily and regularly receive tips:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Waiters/Waitresses</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Counter
personnel who serve customers</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Bellhops</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Busboys/girls
(server helpers)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Service
Bartenders (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to the
above listed occupations, WHD has recognized the following occupations as ones
in which employees customarily and regularly receive tips:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Sushi chefs or
teppanyaki chefs who are similar to counter persons because they have direct
contact and interact with customers, prepare and serve meals to customers in
the bar area or customer tables.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Bartender
assistants or “barbacks” who are similar to bussers because they learn
bartending under the tutelage of a bartender, have the primary duty of
supporting the bartender, and receive their tips from the bartender.   Barbacks
work primarily in the bar area and have the opportunity to occasionally
interact with customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Sommeliers who
explain the wine list, bring the selected bottle of wine to the table, and
serve the wine to the customers.</p>

FLSA 2009-12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There may be court
decisions in a particular region that address the parameters of what
constitutes a customarily and regularly tipped employee. The DD and ADD’s
should inform WHI’s of any cases that may apply. If the DD and ADD’s are in
need of further guidance, they should consult with their respective RSOL.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   It is not
required that all employees who receive tips from a mandatory tip pool
themselves receive tips from customers as long as they work in an occupation
recognized as one in which employees customarily and regularly receive tips.
The amounts retained by the employees who actually receive the tips, and those
given to other pool participants are considered the tips of the individuals who
ultimately retain them, in applying the provisions of Sec. 3(m) and 3(t). 
(Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   The FLSA
does not restrict the amount of tips an employee can be required to contribute
to a valid tip pool.  The employer must notify the employees of any required
tip contribution amount, may only take tip credit for the amount of tips the
employee ultimately receives, and may not retain any of the employee’s tips for
any other purpose.  See 29 CFR 531.54.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Tips
contributed to a mandatory tip pool must not lower the rate of the employee
below the minimum wage. Only those tips that are retained by the employee
(either not contributed to a tip pool, or tips received from the tip pool) are
considered in determining if the employee has received the minimum wage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Tipped
employees may not be required to share their tips with employees who are not
working in occupations in which they customarily and regularly receive tips.
The following employees would therefore not be eligible to participate in a
mandatory tip pool:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Janitors</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Chefs or cooks
(other than performance chefs)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Dishwashers</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Laundry room
attendants</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Salad preparers</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Prep cooks (Rev.
563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   However,
it does not appear that Congress, even in requiring as a general principle that
tipped employees retain all their tips, intended to prevent tipped employees
from deciding free from any coercion whatever and outside of any formalized
arrangement or as a condition of employment, what to do with their tips,
including sharing them with whichever co-workers they please. Tips given to
such co-workers as are listed in this subsection may not, however, be used as a
tip credit.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)  Tip Jar: A tip
jar is a form of tip pooling and should be handled in accordance with the tip
pooling provisions set forth above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(i)    Questions
regarding eligibility of employees to share in tip pooling arrangements which
cannot be answered on the basis of these guidelines should be submitted through
channels to the NO/DEPP for resolution. In the case of host/hostesses, head
waiters or seater/greeters and other employees not referred to above, facts
should be developed showing the practices regarding their sharing of tips in

<h3>30d05 - Tips charged on credit cards.</h3>
<p>            </p>
<p>(a)   When tips
are charged to credit cards, the employer may reduce the amount of tips paid to
the employee by the percentage charged by the credit card company
(transactional fee). However the employer cannot reduce the amount of tips paid
to the employee by any amount greater than the transactional fee. For example,
where a credit card company charges an employer 5 percent on all sales charged
to its credit service, the employer may pay the employee 95 percent of the tips
without violating FLSA. (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Payment
of both minimum wage and overtime compensation, including the charged tips, due
a “tipped employee” must ordinarily be made at the regular payday for the w/w,
or when the pay period covers more than a single w/w, at the regular payday for
the period in which the particular w/w ends. The procedures required to process
charges made by customers through credit cards may delay actual receipt of the
funds by the employer for one or two months. Nevertheless, the employer is
required to pay over the charged tips to the employee on the employee’s next
regular payday.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   In some
situations, a credit card transaction is not collected from a credit card company.
In such cases, the employer is not required to pay a tipped employee the amount
of tips specified on the credit card slip. Of course, this assumes the
inability to collect is not a result of the employer’s failure to submit the
slip for reimbursement, etc.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Where a
credit card charge is uncollectible, the employer is not required to pay the
employee the amount of tip specified on such credit card slip.  Instead, the
employer may recover from a tipped employee those tips that have been paid to
the employee when the credit card charge is uncollectible; however, such
recovered tips may not reduce the tips retained by the employee below the
amount of the tip credit claimed in the earlier workweek.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where there are tip pools, tip pool recipients
are responsible for reimbursing the employer for the share of tips from an
uncollected credit card transaction which was allocated into the tip pool. The
tipped employee who contributed the uncollected tip to the tip pool can only be
held accountable for the portion of the uncollected tip the employee received
back from the tip pool.  For example, the tipped employee contributed $20.00 in
tips from a credit card transaction that ultimately is uncollected to the tip
pool and received back from the tip pool 70% of the tips contributed to the
pool.  The tipped employee can only be required to reimburse the employer for
the 70% of the $20 of the uncollected tip that the employee received from the
tip pool (i.e., $14).  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Cost of
collecting tips charged on credit cards, over and above the amount charged by
the credit card company.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Costs incurred by the employer related to
credit card use, other than the fee charged by a credit card company for
processing may not be used to reduce the amount of the tips the employer must
distribute to the tipped employee. Such costs include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The “time value
of credit card collections,”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The cost of the
credit card terminal, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The cost of
dedicated phone lines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any employer attempt
to deduct an average standard composite amount for tip liquidation that exceeds
the amount charged by the credit card companies is not acceptable.</p>

<h3>30d06 - Determining tip credit.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Section
3(m) limits the tip credit an employer may claim to the difference between the
Sec. 6(a)(1) wage and the cash wage paid by the employer. Under this formula,
the direct or cash wage paid by employer (which may not be less than $2.13 per
hour) plus the tip credit (the difference between the Sec. 6(a)(1) wage and the
cash wage paid) always equal the Sec. 6(a)(1) wage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Under
Sec. 3(m), the direct wage paid may be comprised of cash, board, lodging, or
facilities in accordance with 29 CFR part 531 and FOH 30c.  The tip credit
equals the difference between the minimum wage and the direct wage paid, which
may be comprised of cash, board, lodging, and/or facilities and must be at
least $2.13 per hour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Because
Sec. 3(m) caps a tipped employee’s wage at the minimum wage, an employer that
claims a tip credit may not make deductions for non-3(m) costs, such as
shortages, breakage, cost of uniforms, etc., because any such deduction would
reduce the tipped employee’s wages below the minimum wage.  Under the FLSA,
when the employer claims a tip credit, the tipped employee is considered to
have been paid only the minimum wage for all non-overtime hours worked in a
tipped occupation (for overtime hours, the regular rate may exceed the minimum
wage).  Even when an employer pays more than the $2.13 minimum direct wage, the
employee will have only received the minimum wage and non-3(m) deductions
cannot be made.  For example, if an employer pays a direct wage of $3.13, the
tip credit will be $4.12 and the employee will have only received the minimum
wage.  Non-3(m) deductions may only be made from a tipped employee’s wages when
the employer does not claim a tip credit and pays a direct wage in excess of
the minimum wage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Updating Regulations Issued Under the Fair
Labor Standards Act; Final Rule, 76 FR 18839, April 5, 2011.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Where
FLSA and a state or local law regulating the amount of tip credit that may be
taken by an employer are concurrently applicable, it is the employer’s
responsibility to comply with the more protective wage standard.  (Rev. 563,
12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Examples</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For purposes of these
examples, assume: the Sec. 6(a)(1) wage rate is $7.25 per hour; the employee
worked no overtime hours; the employee meets the Sec. 3(t) definition of tipped
employee; the employer properly advised the employee in advance of the
requirements outlined in 29 CFR 531.59(b); and that the employer maintained
appropriate payroll records.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  When the state
or local minimum wage is the same as the Sec. 6(a)(1) wage, the amount of tip
credit will vary depending on the cash or direct wage paid to the employee. 
Tips in excess of those used toward the tip credit are not considered wages
under Sec. 3(m).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
a.     If
the employer pays a cash wage paid of $2.13 per hour, it may claim a tip credit
of $5.12 per hour ($7.25 - $2.13).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
b.     If
the employer pays a cash wage paid of $3.63 per hour, it may claim a tip credit
of $3.62 per hour ($7.25 - $3.63).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
c.     If
the employer pays a cash wage paid of $4.86 per hour, it may claim a tip credit
of $2.39 per hour ($7.25 - $4.86).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             
d.     If
the employer pays a cash wage of less than the minimum required by the FLSA
($2.13 per hour), it may not claim a tip credit and must pay the difference
between the minimum wage and the cash wage that was paid. For example, if an
employer pays a cash wage of $2.00 per hour, it would not be entitled to claim
a tip credit and must pay the difference between the minimum wage and the cash
wage paid in cash ($5.25 per hour).  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 531.59(b)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  When an
employer pays the full minimum wage in cash to a tipped employee but requires
the employee to participate in an invalid tip pool (i.e., a tip pool including
employees such as dishwashers), the employer must repay the employee all of the
employee’s tips that were used in the tip pool.  The employee is entitled to
the full minimum wage because the employer did not utilize the tip credit; the
employee is entitled to retain all tips because the employer may not utilize an
employee’s tips to pay non-tipped employees through an invalid tip pool.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, if the
employer pays a tipped employee $7.25 per hour in cash but requires the
employee to put $10.00 per shift into a tip pool and distributes all of that
money to dishwashers and other employees who do not customarily and regularly
receive tips, the employer must pay the employee the $10.00 per shift in addition
to the $7.25 per hour as the employer may not utilize the employee’s tips in
furtherance of an invalid tip pool.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30d07 - Tip credit in OT hours.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer may not take a higher tip credit
during overtime hours than is taken during non-overtime hours.  Under Sec.
3(m), the amount of the tip credit is the difference between the direct wage
paid (which cannot be less than $2.13 per hour) and the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum
wage.  This formula determines the maximum amount of an employee’s tips that
can be considered wages per hour during the workweek.  Where an employer pays a
direct wage of $2.13 and claims a tip credit of $5.12 per hour, the employee’s
regular rate would be $7.25 per hour and the employee’s wage for overtime hours
would be $10.88 (of which $5.12 may be a tip credit and $5.76 would be a direct
wage payment).  See FOH 32 regarding overtime computations for tipped
employees.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30d08 - IRS tip allocation rules.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where an employer withholds taxes from a tipped
employee based upon a percentage of sales, rather than on reported tips, a
reduction in an individual employee’s net pay may result, but this is not an
FLSA violation.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)</p>

<h3>30e00 - General provisions -Sec 6(e)(l), contract services (other than
linen supply services).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Section 6(e)(l) of FLSA provides:
“Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13 of this Act (except subsections
(a)(l) and (f) thereof), every employer providing any contract services (other
than linen supply services) under a contract with the United States or any
subcontract thereunder shall pay to each of his employees whose rate of pay is
not governed by the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351-357) or to whom
subsection (a)(l) of this section is not applicable, wages at rates not less
than the rates provided for in subsection (b) of this section”. (Effective
12/31/77, subsec (b) provided for payment of wage rates not less than those
provided in subsec (a)(l).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30e01 - Application of Sec 6(e)(1) - establishment basis.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As an enforcement policy, the MW standard
provided by Sec 6(e)(l) of FLSA will be applied only within an establishment in
which work is performed on a government service contract. Thus, where an
employer operated more than one establishment but performs on government
service contracts in only certain of these establishments, WH will not assert
application of Sec 6(e)(l) to those establishments which do not perform on
government service contracts.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30e02 - Application of Sec 6(e)(1) - w/w basis.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The application of Sec 6(e)(l) of FLSA depends
on the performance of contract services and not on the coverage or exemption
status of the establishment under the Act. Thus, during any w/w in which the
establishment is engaged in the performance of contract services, the wage rate
provided in Sec 6(b) of FLSA would be applicable to all employees of the
establishment other than those specifically exempt under Sec 13(a)(l) of FLSA
or those subject to a higher wage rate pursuant to SCA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30e03 - Application of Sec 6(e)(1) - contract services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Section 6(e)(l) of FLSA applies to every
employer providing any contract service (other than linen supply services)
under a contract with the United States or any subcontractor thereunder. It is
not necessary that the contract be subject to SCA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30e04 - OT and Sec 6(e)(1).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Section 6(e)(l) of FLSA contains no reference
to OT standards and Sec 7 makes no provision for OT for employees covered by
Sec 6(e). OT compensation for employees covered on a traditional or enterprise
basis may be required under section 7(a) of FLSA or under CWHSSA.</p>

<h3>30f00 - General provision - Sec 6(e)(2), government contract linen supply
services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Section 6(e)(2) of FLSA provides:
“Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13 of this Act (except subsections
(a)(l) and (f) thereof) and the provisions of the Service Contract Act of 1965,
every employer in an establishment providing linen supply services to the United
States under a contract with the United States or any subcontract thereunder
shall pay to each of his employees in such establishment wages at rates not
less than those prescribed in subsection (b), except that if more than 50 per
centum of the gross annual dollar volume of sales made or business done by such
establishment is derived from providing such linen supply services under any
such contracts or subcontracts, such employer shall pay to each of his
employees in such establishment wages at rates not less than those prescribed
in subsection (a)(l) of this section”. (Effective 12/31/77, subsec (b) provided
for payment of wage rates not less than those provided in subsec (a)(l).)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30f01 - Linen supply services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The
application of section 6(e)(2) of FLSA is determined by the type of service
contracted for and not by the type of establishment performing the service.
Thus, for example, a laundry may provide linen supply service within the
meaning of Sec 6(e)(2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The term
linen supply services as used in section 6(e)(2) of FLSA refers to the
supplying of various items to the Government on a rental basis by a contractor
who owns the item being supplied. On the other hand, the mere laundering of
items which are owned by the Government is a laundering service and is not a
“linen supply service” within the meaning of Sec 6(e)(2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The term
“linen supply services”, in addition to including such services as the rental
of tablecloths, sheets, and pillowcases, would also include contracts for such
items as dresses, uniforms, other wearing apparel, bibs aprons, etc., of the
type used by barbers, doctors, waitresses, waiters, nurses, food workers,
beauticians, etc. It would not include services for such items as diapers,
laundry, or dry cleaning (family or commercial), nor services for such items as
industrial wiping towels, safety equipment and salvage, dust control - -
including treated dust tool covers and cloths, treated dust mops or rugs, or
for industrial work uniforms, such as those worn by mechanics and production
workers in heavy industry, machine shops, garages, service stations and the
like.</p>

<h3>30f02 - Application of Sec 6(e)(2) - establishment basis.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The MW standard provided by section 6(e)(2) of FLSA
applies only within an establishment in which work is performed on a government
linen supply contract. Thus, where an employer operates more than one
establishment but performs on government linen supply contracts in only certain
of the establishments, WH will not assert application of Sec 6(e)(2) to the
establishments which do not perform on government linen supply contracts.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30f03 - Application of Sec 6(e)(2) - w/w basis.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The application of section 6(e)(2) of FLSA
depends on the performance of linen supply services to the government and not
on the coverage or exemption status of the establishment under the Act. Thus,
during any w/w in which the establishment is engaged in the performance of
linen supply services, the wage rate provided in Sec 6(b) of FLSA would be
applicable to all employees of the establishment other than those specifically
exempt under Sec 13(a)(l) of FLSA or those subject to a higher wage rate
pursuant to SCA.</p>

<h3>30f04 - Application of Sec 6(e)(2) - linen supply services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Section 6(e)(2) of FLSA applies to every
employer providing linen supply services under a contract with the United
States or any subcontract thereunder. It is not necessary that the contract be
subject to SCA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>30f05 - OT and Sec 6(e)(2).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Section 6(e)(2) of FLSA contains no reference
to OT standards and Sec 7 makes no provision for OT for employees covered by
Sec 6(e). OT compensation for employees covered on a traditional or enterprise
basis may be required under section 7(a) of FLSA or under CWHSSA.</p>

<h3>31a00. Employees sent home for lack of work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If
an employee is told upon reporting for work that there is no work available and
is immediately sent home, he/she will not be considered to have spent any time
working. If, however, the employee reports for work at the scheduled place at
the prescribed time and is not immediately sent home but is suffered or
permitted to wait for work after the regular shift was scheduled to begin, the
time spent in waiting between the scheduled commencement of the shift and the
time the employee starts work or is sent home is counted as working time. Some
employment agreements provide for the payment of a minimum number of hours pay
to an employee on those occasions when he/she reports for work and none is
available. Pay arrangements of this kind are discussed in IB 778.220 - 778.222.
(See FOH 32d04.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31a01. Rest periods.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Rest periods of short duration,
running from 5 minutes to about 20 minutes, are common in industry. They
promote the efficiency of the employee and are customarily paid for as working
time. They must be counted as hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Where a regular rest period of
known duration is longer than 20 minutes, the waiting time rules apply. In
other words, if the employees are free to go where they please, and the rest
period is long enough to permit the employees to use it for their own purposes,
and if bona fide and not an attempt to evade or circumvent the FLSA or PCA,
such periods are not hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Unauthorized extensions of
authorized breaks are not counted as hours worked for an employee when the
employer had expressly and unambigously communicated to the employee that:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The authorized break may only last for a specific
length of time;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Any extension of such break is contrary to the
employer’s rules; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Any extension of such a break will be punished.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31a02. Homeworker’s waiting time.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If
the employer designates the exact time for reporting and the homeworker reports
at that time and is compelled to wait, the time spent in waiting must be
considered as hours worked. If the homeworker reports at a time which is not
prearranged or at a time other than that specified by the employer and the
employer is not prepared to accept the finished goods and charge out new
material to the homeworker, the time spent in waiting will not be considered as
hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1/  This
chapter supplements IB Part 785 and is not of itself a complete statement of
the Division’s position on hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31a03. Idle time during the normal workday while in travel status.</h3>
<p>When
employees are in travel status and the employer wishes to pay them for idle
hours during which they normally would have worked had they been employed at
their regular job and in their regular place of employment, we will respect the
agreement of the parties and allow them to count the hours as hours worked. The
hours must be counted as hours worked in all respects and they must be taken
into consideration when computing OT.</p>

<h3>31b00. Less than 24 hours duty.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An
employee who is required to be on duty for less than 24 hours is working even
though permitted to sleep or engage in other personal activities when not busy.
For example, a telephone operator who is required to be on duty for specified
hours is working even though permitted to sleep when not answering calls, It
makes no difference that facilities are furnished for sleeping. The employee’s
time is given to the employer. The employee is required to be on duty and the
time is work time.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b01a.           Clothes changing and washup time on a formula basis.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An
employer may set up a formula by which employees are allowed given amounts of
time to perform clothes changing and washup activities, provided the time set
is reasonable in relation to the actual time required to perform such
activities. The time allowed will be considered reasonable if a majority of the
employees usually perform the activities within the given time.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b02  Employees residing temporarily on employer’s premises.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
There are certain circumstances
(usually at locations such as hard-to-reach construction jobs, isolated
dredging barges and offshore drilling sites) where practical considerations
make it necessary for employees to remain temporarily on the employer’s
premises and to eat and sleep there during their stay. In such situations, the
employees shall not be considered as on “duty of 24 hours or more” if they have
a regular schedule of hours and thereafter are relieved of duties except for
extra work required by the exigencies of the job. Only the actual working time
need be counted as hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The rules governing “duty of 24
hours or more” (IB 785.22) are applicable where, from all the conditions of
employment, including the understanding of the parties, it is clear that the
employee is employed to wait rather than waiting to be employed. Among the
factors which would support such a conclusion are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  the employee has no regular schedule of hours, or a
schedule in name only, and is required to perform work on a helter-skelter
basis at any time during the day or night; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  the employee has a regular schedule of hours but the
unscheduled periods are so cut through with frequent work calls that this time
is not his/her own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Some employers, such as offshore
oil well drilling contractors, arrange transportation to remote locations in
such a way that two crews having regular work schedules as in (a) above, arrive
at the same time. One crew will ordinarily go to work immediately and the other
must wait through an entire shift (or a substantial portion thereof) before
starting work. At the end of the tour of duty at the worksite, one crew, after
completing its last shift, must wait through the last shift (or a substantial
portion thereof) of the other crew before crews are transported back from the
worksite at the same time. Such waiting time on the initial and terminal days
is as much an integral part of those particular 24-hour periods as the idle
periods between the regular workshifts on the other workdays. Where the
employees are not on call and are completely relieved of duty, such idle time
on the initial and terminal days is not considered hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b04. Radio announcers and performers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Time
spent by performers, including radio announcers on out-of-stretch (see FOH
32d08a) radio and television programs for which talent fees (as defined in Reg
550) are paid, is not counted as hours worked provided the fee is sufficient to
compensate for the straight time and OT compensation which would normally be
due for such time.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b05. Participation in athletic contests.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As
an enforcement policy, Wage-Hour will not consider as hours worked under the
FLSA or PCA any time spent by an employee as a participant in, or as an umpire,
referee, scorer, or similar official in an athletic contest sponsored by the
employer, if the participation of the employee in these activities is
completely voluntary and if his/her regular employment is not conditioned upon
participating in these activities.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b07. Knife sharpening.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Knife
sharpening activities of knifemen are an integral part of and indispensable to
the various butchering activities for which they are employed. The time so spent
is compensable under the FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b08. Emergency Government employment and disaster relief work.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Since persons summoned or called
upon by Government or other public officials, pursuant to statutory authority,
to engage in firefighting, national defense, civil defense, flood control, or
other activities, become in legal effect employees of the State or Federal
Government, the employer whose employees have been so engaged is not required
to consider time spent in such activities as hours worked for the company
during the w/w. Any money paid for such activities need not be included in
determining the regular rate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Similarly, where contractors are
specifically requested by Federal, State, or local authority under the general
police powers of the Government concerned to furnish employees to render
disaster relief services such as rescuing injured persons, restoring municipal
services, clearing streets, and controlling damage, these contractors and their
employees will be considered employees of the Government and the Act applied in
the same manner as in (a) above. Thus, the time spent on such work need not be
counted as hours worked, and any compensation paid for such emergency work need
not be included in the regular rate. Such services are normally furnished
without compensation to the contractor (or at cost) and the arrangement is
terminated as soon as immediate needs are met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
If a contractor contracts with a
Government agency for work following a disaster, to be performed as a
commercial venture or as part of his/her regular business activity (as
distinguished from (b) above), the Act shall be applied in the regular manner.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b09. Hours worked by truck drivers, including team drivers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Time spent in sleeping berths in
trucks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Berths
in trucks are regarded as adequate sleeping facilities for the purposes of IB
785.41 and 785.22. However, this rule applies to sleeping berth time of truck
drivers or helpers only when they are on continuous tours of duty during trips
away from home for a period of 24 hours or more. If the trip begins and ends at
the home station and is performed within one working day (less than 24 hours),
all time on duty on the truck is time worked (except, of course, for bona fide
meal periods) even though some of that time is spent in the sleeping berth.
(FOH 31b00.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Tours of duty of 24 hours or more
but less than 48 hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>FOH
31b12 and IB 785.22 describe excludable sleep time for hours of duty of 24
hours or more. On continuous tours of duty of more than 24 hours but less than
48 hours, one extra hour of sleep time in excess of the maximum 8 hours may be
claimed for each hour beyond 40 that a continuous tour of duty extends,
provided that the employee has actually slept such number of hours. For
example, in a 42-hour continuous tour of duty, no more than 10 hours could be
deducted for sleep time. Similarly, in a 45-hour continuous tour, a maximum of
13 hours could be deducted. However, in the absence of an express or implied
agreement concerning the exclusion of sleep time, the time spent sleeping
constitutes hours worked even though the tour of duty exceeds 24 hours. See
also 31b12.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Continuous tours of duty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  As indicated in IB 785.12 through 785.16, waiting or
layover time will be considered off-duty time and not part of the employee’s
hours of work if the employee is completely relieved of all duties and
responsibilities, is permitted to leave the truck or temporary station to go
anywhere, knows in advance that work will not resume until a specified time,
and the period of layover is of sufficient length to be used effectively for
the employee’s own purposes. Thus, no standard rule of thumb, such as “2-hour
layover time” or “4-hour layover time” can be used to unequivocally state that
a layover period of such length has automatically broken a continuous tour of
duty. Whether or not a continuous tour of duty greater than 24 hours is
interrupted by a waiting or layover time is a question of fact. For example, if
a truck driver stops for a layover of 2 hours, but the stopping point happens
to be in a remote location which has no available facilities (restaurants,
etc.), the tour of duty has not been interrupted and the “off-duty” time is
compensable hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  With regard to team truck drivers, because of the
special circumstances under which they work, we would not regard a bona fide
layover period as breaking a continuous tour of duty if the employer paid wages
for that period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Time spent in noncompensable bona fide meal periods
and bona fide regularly scheduled sleeping periods would not break a continuous
tour of duty provided that such periods do not exceed the maximum limitations
in 785.22 and the “40-hour rule” set forth in (b) above. (See also 31b12.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b10. Medical treatment during “normal workday”.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If
an employer directs an employee, or any group of employees, to work beyond the
regularly scheduled workshift the “normal workday” of such employee, or group
of employees, has been extended, and the same principle in IB 785.43 applies</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b11. Book reviews by newspaper, radio, or television employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In
some instances an employee of a newspaper or radio or television station will
read a particular book with the view to a possible book review story for use in
the newspaper or on the air. This presents no problem as to hours worked where
the reading is done in the course of the employee’s regular duties at the establishment
or elsewhere at any time at the employer’s specific request. However, the
reading may be done away from the employer’s establishment and outside duty
hours, such as at the employee’s home in the evening, and on a speculative
basis - that is, with the thought that a book review might be prepared. In such
cases there is a substantial question as to whether the reading was done for
the benefit of the employer or for the pleasure or information of the employee.
In such cases, WH will not assert that such reading is hours worked even though
the book is subsequently reviewed in the newspaper or on the air.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b12. Duty or 24 hours or more - sleeping time.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
If an employee is required to be
on duty 24 hours or more, the employer and employee may agree to exclude a bona
fide regularly scheduled sleeping period, provided adequate sleeping facilities
are furnished by the employer and the employee can usually enjoy an
uninterrupted night’s sleep. (See IB 785.22.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
It is the position of WH that a
reasonable night’s sleep means that an employee obtains at least five hours of
sleep during the scheduled period. These five hours need not be five continuous
uninterrupted hours of sleep. However, if interruptions are so frequent as to
prevent reasonable periods of sleep totaling not less than five hours, the
entire period would be considered hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b13. Changing clothes at home.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees
who dress to go to work in the morning are not working while dressing even
though the uniforms they put on at home are required to be used in the plant
during working hours. Similarly, any changing which takes place at home at the
end of the day would not be an integral part of the employees’ employment and
is not working time.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b14. “On-call” employees required to remain at home.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
an “on-call” employee performs services for his employer at home and yet has
long periods of uninterrupted leisure during which he can engage in the normal
activities of living, Wage-Hour will accept any reasonable agreement of the
parties for determining the number of hours worked. As an example, this policy
will apply to an “on-call” employee who is required by the employer to remain
at home to receive telephone calls from customers when the company office is
closed. The agreement should take into account not only the actual time spent
in answering the calls but also some allowance for the restriction on the
employee’s freedom to engage in personal activities resulting from the duty of
answering the telephone.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b15. Fire and disaster drills.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Time
spent by employees in participating in fire or other disaster drills, whether
voluntary or involuntary or during or after regular working hours, is
considered substantially to the benefit of the employer and therefore is
compensable hours of work. Of course, such time may be compensated at the
applicable statutory MW rather than the employees’ regular rates.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b16. Inspections under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Sec 8(e) of the OSHA provides
that:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  during an inspection under that Act an authorized
representative of the employees shall be given an opportunity to accompany the
OSHA Inv; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  where there is no authorized employee representative,
the OSHA Inv shall consult with a reasonable number of employees concerning
health and safety at their workplace.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Time spent by an employee
accompanying the OSHA Inv as in (a)(1) above is not considered hours worked.
Sec 8(e) of the OSHA does not require that an employee representative accompany
the Inv, nor does it impose a duty on the employer to require an employee to
accompany the Inv. Such time spent by an employee is considered voluntary and
primarily (although not wholly) for the benefit of the employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Time spent by employees consulting
with the OSHA Inv as in (a)(2) above during their normal workday when required
to be on the employer’s premises is hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b17. Training courses and programs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>IB
785.27 - 785.31 contains guidelines for determining whether attendance or
participation by employees in training courses and programs constitute hours
worked (see also FOH 10b11). Certain training plans may require as a condition
of promotion within an occupational classification or to a higher
classification, the satisfactory completion of a prescribed course of study.
Attendance at or participation in such courses will be considered voluntary
where the existing classification level or working conditions are not adversely
affected by an employee’s decision not to participate.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b18. Employees residing on employers’ premises - recording working
time.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Where there is a “reasonable
agreement” between employer and employee pursuant to IB 785.23, such an
agreement establishes the hours the employee is considered to work, but precise
R/K regarding hours worked is not required. The employer may keep a time record
showing the schedule adopted in the agreement and indicate that the employee’s
work time generally coincided with the agreement or schedule. If it is found by
the parties that there is significant deviation from the initial agreement, a
new agreement should be reached reflecting the actual facts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The “reasonable agreement” must be
an employer-employee agreement and not a unilateral decision by the employer.
Such an agreement should normally be in writing in order to preclude any
possible misunderstanding of the terms and conditions of an individual’s
employment. It must take into account not only the time spent working but also
the time when the employee may engage in normal private pursuits, with sufficient
time for eating, sleeping, entertaining, and other periods of complete freedom
from all duties when he or she may leave the premises for personal reasons. The
agreement must also consider such relevant factors as the degree to which the
use of the employee’s personal time is limited or restricted by the conditions
of employment and the extent of interruption to eating and sleeping periods.
However, whether an employee is free to use time for personal pursuits will
depend on the facts in each case, notwithstanding the provisions of any written
agreement.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b19. Hours of work for firemen and policemen.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
rules on hours of work for firemen and policemen are covered in Reg 553,
Subpart C, “Fire Protection and Law Enforcement Employees of Public Agencies.”
See also FOH Secs 31b21 and 31b22.</p>

<h3>31b20. Employees residing on the employer’s premises for five days a
week.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The “reasonable agreement”
referred to in IB 785.23 may apply to an employee who resides on the employer’s
premises five days a week, since such employee may be considered as residing on
the employer’s premises “for extended periods of time”. (See Reg 552.102.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Ordinarily, an employee residing
on the employer’s premises for 120 hours or more in a week would meet the
requirements of (a) above. Where less than 120 hours in a week are spent
residing on the employer’s premises, five consecutive days or nights would also
qualify as residing on the premises “for extended periods of time.” For
example, employees who are on duty from 9 a.m. Monday until 5 p.m. Friday would
also be considered to reside on the employer’s premises. Even though on duty
for less than 120 hours, they are on duty for five consecutive days (Monday
through Friday). The fact that they sleep over only four nights does not alter
this conclusion. Similarly, employees who are on duty from 9 p.m. Monday until
9 a.m. Saturday would also be considered to reside on their employer’s premises
since they are on duty for five consecutive nights (Monday night through Friday
night).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b21. Meal periods for employees under Sec 7(k).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Pursuant
to Reg 553.15(a), where an employee employed under Sec 7(k) is on duty 24 hours
or less, meal time may not be excluded from hours worked in the usual
circumstance. However, where such an employee is completely relieved from duty
during the meal period, and is not required, for example, to remain in radio
contact, such an employee would be off duty during this period and such time
would not be included in hours worked for purposes of Sec 7(k).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b22. Fire fighters - time spent sleeping.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Under
Reg 553.222(c), where an employer and employee had agreed that time spent
sleeping be compensable, the employer cannot make unilateral changes in the
agreement in order to exclude sleep time from compensable hours of work and
then consider the employee’s continued employment to be acceptance of such
change. Some form of uncoerced mutual assent is necessary to consider the
parties’ agreement validly changed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reg
553.222(c) does not address the converse, i.e., the procedure for making sleep
time compensable where there was previously an expressed or implied agreement
to exclude such time from compensable hours of work. Consequently, an employee
could unilaterally withdraw his/her consent and the employer would then be
required to compensate the employee for any future sleep time that may occur.
However, the employer would not be required to agree to a continuation of the
same terms and conditions of employment. The employer and employee would be
free to establish new conditions of employment, such as rate of pay, hours of
work, or reassignment. Where employees are represented for collective
bargaining purposes, such changes in the terms or conditions of employment
could be addressed within the collective bargaining process. Non-represented
employees would be left to private agreement between the employer and
themselves.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31b23. Meal periods of less than 30 minutes.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Bona
fide meal periods are not worktime. Bona fide meal periods do not include
coffee breaks or time for snacks. Ordinarily 30 minutes or more is long enough
for a bona fide meal period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meal
periods of less than 30 minutes during which the employee is completely
relieved for purposes of eating a meal may be bona fide – and thus not hours
worked – when certain special conditions are present (Reg. 785.19). The conditions reviewed to make this
determination, which should be considered in context on a case-by-case basis,
include:</p>

<h3>31c00. Employees required to perform duties while traveling.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In
the case of employees required to travel several days and to perform active
duty while traveling, such as feeding or watering cattle sent to market by rail
or the like, it is difficult to determine the exact hours worked. Under these
circumstances, any reasonable agreement entered into between the employer and
the employee, or established by custom or practice, which takes into account
the amount of time required for active labor by the employee and the fact that
the employee is subject to call 24 hours a day, will be acceptable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following SUPERSEDES FOH
31c01 and 31c02: - INSERT #1608  (3/6/81)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31c01. Operating employer’s vehicle for employee’s convenience.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
In certain situations, an employee
is responsible for a vehicle and its equipment and for having it at the
worksite at the proper time. The employer may permit the employee to drive the
vehicle to and from home. In situations of this type where the permission is
granted for the employee’s own convenience and the travel is within the normal
commuting distance of employees in the area, time spent in driving is not
“hours worked”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Where the vehicle is also used in
connection with emergency calls outside of normal working hours, a
determination must be made as to whether the use of the vehicle is in fact for
the convenience of the employee or primarily for the benefit of the employer.
The frequency of emergency calls may indicate for whose convenience or benefit
the vehicle is being used.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31c02. Driving employer’s vehicle transporting other employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Driving time is not considered
“hours worked” in instances where an employee elects to transport other
employees to and from work and such employee is driving the employer’s vehicle
for his/her own convenience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
On the other hand, where the
driver is directed by the employer to report to the company warehouse, garage,
or yard as a pickup point, then time spent driving the employees from such
point to the workplace is “hours worked”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Drivers of “vanpools” need not be
paid for time spent transporting other employees to and from work under the
following conditions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The transportation provided must be primarily for the
benefit of participating employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Participation in the program is entirely voluntary and
employees are free to accept or reject the arrangement at any time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The employee-driver is chosen by the participating
employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The pickup times and route are established by the
participating employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  The employer has virtually no control over the
arrangement.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31c03. Owner-drivers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Whether the time spent in caring
for a team of horses, or for a truck, and driving to and from the job site
outside the employee’s workday is hours worked, depends on the nature of the
hiring agreement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
If under the agreement the
employer has no right to possession of the team or truck away from the job site
but has merely hired the use of the team or truck for the daily working period
at the job site, beginning after the delivery there of the harnessed team or
the truck by the owner and ending when the owner leaves with his team or truck,
the employer obviously has no responsibility for the team or truck outside this
period, and cannot direct what is to be done in the way of caring for it, or
how, where, or by whom it shall be readied for work. In such an event, the care
and transportation of the team or truck would be engaged in by the owner and
not as an employee of the employer Under these circumstances, time spent in those
activities outside the employee’s workday at the job site would not be hours
worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
On the other hand if the agreement
between the employer and the employee contemplates outright hire of the team or
truck for a period of time so that the owner employee is caring for the team or
truck and transporting it as a mere custodian for the employer to whom it is
rented, the time so spent by the employee is hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
In these situations, a
determination of hours worked cannot be made unless the Inv ascertains exactly
the terms of the agreement between the employer and the employee.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31c04. Travel where heavy, burdensome equipment is carried.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Travel time spent in carrying
heavy burdensome equipment, as contrasted with light hand tools, is hours
worked. On the other hand, carrying light hand tools between an employee’s home
and his work site, involving no appreciable burden or inconvenience, is not
hours worked. In determinations of this kind, some consideration must be given
to the custom in the industry. For example, it is not a part of a carpenter’s
principal activities for him to carry his usual tool box, containing hammer,
saw, et cetera, from his home to his work site.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
An employee who is required
regularly to carry heavy mail or bulky packages to the post office en route
from the factory to his home, is working. A different situation exists if an
employee carries only light mail to and from the post office on the way to or
from work, and generally the time so spent is not hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following supersedes FOH
31c05 (this reverses the prior position of WH concerning travel time by
homeworkers): INSERT #1763 (8/8/88)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31c05. Homeworker’s travel.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
time spent by homeworkers in traveling to and from the employer’s premises (or
other pickup/dropoff point) to obtain work-related materials or equipment
and/or to deliver finished products, is primarily for the employer’s benefit
and must be included in the total hours worked by homeworkers. Where such trips
are combined with personal errands (e.g., grocery shopping or visits with
friends), the time spent in such personal pursuits is excluded from the total
travel time for the trip in calculating hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NOTE:       The
BW recovery period, as a result of noncompliance with this position, shall not
extend back beyond the date of this insert (8/8/88).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31c06. Emergency calls.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Normal travel from home to work is
not worktime. however there may be instances when travel from home to work is
worktime For example, it an employee who has gone home after completing his
day’s work is subsequently called out at night to travel a substantial distance
to perform an emergency job for one of his employer’s customers, all time spent
on such travel is working time However, where an employee is given prior
notice, as for example, he is told on Friday that he will be required to work
at a customer’s place of business on Saturday, it will not be considered as an
emergency call outside his regular working hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
WHPC is taking no position on
whether travel to the job and back home by an employee who receives an
emergency call outside of his regular hours to report back to his regular place
or places of work to do a job is working time. Therefore, such time will no
longer be counted as hours worked. In the event that a position on this type of
travel is again adopted the provisions of FOH 52f07(a)(1) will apply to past
violations on any such positions.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31c07. Travel by boat or helicopter.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Time
spent in travel by boat or helicopter from a dock or heliport to an offshore
drilling rig and return by employees engaged in offshore drilling for oil is a
preliminary and postliminary activity. As such, it must be counted as hours
worked under Sec. 4(b) of the PA to the extent that it is compensable by
contract, custom or practice. Thus, if all of the time spent in such travel is
paid for, all of it must be counted as hours worked. On the other hand, where
payment is made for a portion of the time spent in such travel, only that
portion of the travel time which has been made compensable must be counted as
hours worked. In this respect, where a partial payment is made and the
employer’s records do not indicate the portion of the travel time that is to be
compensated the intent of the parties and all the facts and circumstances
surrounding the agreement or understanding will determine what portion of the
travel time has been made compensable.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31c08. Layover or on-call time of drivers and helpers.</h3>
<p> </p>

<h3>31c09. Temporary help firms.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
typical temporary help firm (such as Peakload, Inc. and Manpower, Inc.) is
engaged in supplying workers employed by the firm on an “as needed” basis to
various establishments. A person who desires employment usually registers with
the temporary help firm. For certain types of jobs the registrant usually
voluntarily “shows up” at some central location where he awaits employment
opportunity. If work is available or becomes available, he is sent or taken to
the customer’s establishment. If accepted by the customer, he remains and
performs the work of that employer. At the end of the day, the worker is free
to go home and collect his pay later or to return to the central location to be
paid for his work. The circumstances vary. If the employment understanding
clearly is that the pay or the time of the employee begins and ends at the
customer’s establishment, waiting for assignments at the central location or in
travel from there to the customer’s establishment and return would not be
compensable worktime. In other words, his working time is computed in the same
manner as if he had gone directly from his home to the customer’s establishment
and returned home from there at the end of the day. This would be true even
though he may be assigned to work at the same customer’s establishment for more
than one day.</p>

<h3>31c10. Compensability of travel time of employees who voluntarily drive
company vehicles between home and work sites.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Background:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  In some industries employers utilize somewhat modified
vans or trucks for use by employees who perform service work at a customer’s
home or business establishment. The vehicle provides a necessary means for the
employee to transport needed parts, tools, equipment, etc., to various work
sites during the day. The employer may give employees the opportunity to drive
the vehicle between home and work on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  In some instances, the employee starts the work day by
calling the employer’s dispatcher from home, receiving one or more work
assignments to begin the work day, and traveling directly from home to the
first work site rather than traveling first to the employer’s establishment and
then to the work site. At the end of the day the employee may be required to
call the employer’s dispatcher to advise that the last service call for the day
has been completed and that the employee is leaving the last work site for
home, where the employee parks and locks the vehicle. During this call to the
dispatcher, the employee may or may not receive assignments for the next day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  WH policy on the compensability of travel time in such
situations was set forth in an Administrator’s opinion letter dated August 5, 1994.
In light of the concerns expressed by both employers and employees, and the
possible effects of applying this interpretation in a wide variety of
industries, the Secretary of Labor, on October 19, 1994, deferred any WH
efforts to enforce the policy in that opinion letter while a review was
undertaken.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Policy:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An
Administrator’s opinion letter was issued on April 3, 1995, which withdrew the
August 5, 1994, opinion letter and set forth WH’s position in this matter.
Accordingly, where the following circumstances exist, time spent traveling
between the employee’s home and the first work site of the day and between the
last work site of the day and the employee’s home need not be compensated:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  driving the employer’s vehicle between the employee’s
home and customers’ work sites at the beginning and end of the workday is
strictly voluntary and not a condition of employment;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  the vehicle involved is the type of vehicle that would
normally be used for commuting;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  the employee incurs no costs for driving the employer’s
vehicle or parking it at the employee’s home or elsewhere; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  the work sites are within the normal commuting area of
the employer’s establishment.</p>

<h3>31d00. Ambulance services.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Numerous hours worked questions
may arise with respect to employees engaged in ambulance services. The most
common are as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Less than 24 hours duty. Ambulance employees who are
required to be on duty at their employer’s place of business for periods of
less than 24 hours are working even though they are permitted to sleep or
engage in other personal activities when not busy. (See IB 785.21.) However,
the usual rules with respect to meal periods would apply when they are relieved
of all duties for the purpose of eating meals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Duty of 24 hours or more. (See IB 785.22.) Some
ambulance employees may be required by the employer to be on duty on his
premises for 24 hours or more. The parties may agree to exclude bona fide meal
periods and a regularly scheduled sleeping period of not more than 8 hours,
provided the employer furnishes adequate sleeping facilities and the employee
can usually enjoy uninterrupted sleep during the period. If the sleeping period
is more than 8 hours, only 8 hours may be excluded from hours worked. Any
interruption of the sleeping period to respond to calls must be counted as
hours worked. If the period is interrupted to such an extent that the employee
cannot get a reasonable “night’s sleep”, the entire sleeping period must be
counted as hours worked. For enforcement purposes, the “night’s sleep” will be
considered reasonable if the employee can get at least 5 hours sleep during the
period. Thus, where these tests are met, the actual sleeping time (i.e., not
less than 5 hours and not more than 8 hours) may be excluded from hours worked.
Off-duty periods during which the employee has complete freedom from duties and
may leave the premises for his own purposes may also be excluded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Employees who reside on the employer’s premises
permanently or for extended periods of time. Some ambulance service employees
reside on their employer’s premises. In such cases, the employee is not working
all the time he is on the premises. In determining hours worked, bona fide
off-duty time need not be counted and any reasonable agreement of the parties
which takes into consideration all the pertinent facts will be accepted. (See
IB 785.23.) In the absence of an agreement, the Inv should make a reasonable
determination giving recognition to the facts in the particular case which
indicate the amount of time that the employee does have to eat, sleep, and
devote to his own pursuits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  On-call time. Except where the employee is on duty 24
hours or more or resides on the premises, time spent by an employee in an
“on-call” status at his employer’s establishment is hours worked. On the other
hand, where an employee is not required to remain on his employer’s premises
but is free to engage in his own pursuits and merely required to leave word
where he may be reached, the time so spent is not considered to be hours
worked. See IB 785.17.) If the employee does in fact go out on a call, the time
actually spent in making the call including travel time is hours worked. Also,
there may be situations when calls are so frequent or the “on-call” conditions
so restrictive that the employee is not really free to use the intervening
periods for his own benefit. In such cases he may be considered as “engaged to
wait” rather than “waiting to be engaged” and the waiting time would also be
counted as hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Employee who takes ambulance to his home. In the
ordinary case where an employer permits an employee to drive an ambulance to
and from his home for the employee’s own convenience, the time so spent in
driving is not hours worked (see FOH 31c01). If the employee is required to
take the ambulance home in order to be able to respond to calls immediately,
all the time spent in driving would be hours worked. The time the ambulance
remains parked idly outside the employee’s residence, and the employee is free
to engage in his own pursuits subject only to the understanding that he leave
word at his home or with company officials where he may be reached, would not
be regarded as hours worked under the Act. The waiting time would be counted as
hours worked only in situations of the type referred to in the last two
sentences of paragraph (4). If the ambulance is parked at the employee’s home,
the employee would be considered working from the time he sets out on a call
until the time he returns to his home.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>31d01. Community residences for the mentally retarded. and others in
need of custodial care.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Employees of these group homes may
have regularly scheduled off-duty periods during the day (for which they are
not paid) which might ordinarily break a continuous tour of duty of 24 hours or
more. Therefore, a question arises as to whether their sleep time can be
deducted from working time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Full-time houseparents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
facilities in question employ houseparents, as well as relief staff in many
cases, to provide custodial care for individuals who reside at the facilities.
The houseparents sleep overnight, sometimes as many as 5 or 6 days in a row,
after which they get a day or 2 off. In addition, the houseparents may also
have several hours off each afternoon, when they are free to do whatever they
choose, including leaving the premises. They sleep in private quarters separate
from the residents of the group home. Many of these houseparents maintain
permanent residences elsewhere in the community, but others have as their only
residence the facility for the mentally retarded. Where such full-time house
parents meet the standards set forth in FOH 31b20, they are considered to be
residing on the premises in accordance with IB 785.23. Therefore, the sleeptime
rules in IB 785.22 and .23 will be applied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Relief employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The relief staff may stay overnight at a facility for
one or more nights a week. During a 24-hour period, these employees may also
have regularly scheduled off-duty time during the day with complete freedom
from all responsibilities. They, too, sleep in private quarters separate from
the residents of the group home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  In situations where a community residence employs at
least one employee who resides on the employer’s premises “for extended periods
of time” (see FOH 31b20 and IB 785.23), the employer and a relief employee who
performs essentially the same duties as such full-time employee may enter into
a “reasonable agreement” (see FOH 31(b)(18)(b)) to hours worked. Such an
agreement, entered into in advance of the performance of any work, may provide
that sleeping time of up to 8 hours can be excluded from compensable hours of
work, regardless of the length of the tour of duty involved. Also, a mutually
agreed-upon amount of off-duty time, during which the employee is completely
free from all responsibilities, can be excluded from compensable hours of work.
Since the residents of such facilities are usually on the premises all day on
weekends, the hours worked by weekend relief employees may be significantly
longer than the hours worked by the employees who work weekdays. Agreements
with weekend employees must reflect such differences.</p>

<h3>32a00  Interpretations and instructions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
IB 778, Reg 50-201.103, R &amp; I
No. 3, and FOH Chapter 32 contain the official Wage-Hour interpretations and
instructions regarding the applicability of the maximum hours and OT premium
pay provisions of the FLSA and PCA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
In each instance where a new OT
standard is applicable, e.g., 48 hours to 44 hours, or where employment is
newly subject to an OT standard, it shall be effective as to any w/w beginning
on or after the date indicated.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32a01  Application of partial OT exemptions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Notwithstanding IB 778.603, where
OT has not been paid for hours worked in excess of the statutory w/w standard,
BW are owed to the employee only for the hours worked in excess of the
statutory standard ( e.g., 48, 46, 44) in the following exemptions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec
13(b)(4) - Fish processing</p>
<p>Sec
13(b)(7) - Local transit</p>
<p>Sec
13(b)(8) - Restaurant and hotel</p>
<p>Sec
13(b)(18) - Food service</p>
<p>Sec
13(b)(19) - Bowling alley</p>
<p>Sec
13(b)(23) - Telegraph</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
BW will be based, with appropriate
modifications, on the enforcement policy in FOH 20i09 in the following
exemptions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec
7(m) - Tobacco :(see also FOH 20t01(c).)</p>
<p>Sec
7(c) and 7(d) - Seasonal industries</p>
<p>Sec
13(b)(25) - Cotton</p>
<p>Sec
13(b)(26) – Sugar</p>
<p>Sec
13(h) - Cotton, Cottonseed and Sugar</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
If OT has not been paid for hours
over 8 or 80, as required by Sec 7(j), BW are owed for hours worked over these
standards. However, if there is no prior agreement (see FOH 25h02) to utilize
7(j), BW are due for hours over 40 a week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
The policy in FOH 25c01 will be
followed for BW if the conditions in Sec 7(b)(3) are not met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
If no work period is designated or
otherwise objectively established for purposes of Sec 7(k), as for example by
employee agreement or established practice, BW are owed for hours over 40 a
week. However, if the preconditions are met, BW are owed for hours worked in
excess of the work period standard.</p>

<h3>32b00a            Regular rate for w/w’s in which employee receives no
pay or only partial payment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The regular rate for purposes of
BW computations for OT weeks in which an employee subject to the OT provisions
of the Acts receive no pay or only part of his pay shall be determined on the
basis of the established practice, agreement, or understanding. In the case of
an employee paid solely on the basis of an hourly rate, this hourly rate shall
be the regular rate for purposes of computations during such weeks. Similarly,
where it is determined that the practice or agreement by which an employee’ s
wages are computed is, for example, an established weekly salary, piece rate or
day rate, such salary, piece rate or day rate shall be used to compute the
regular rate. The following examples illustrate the application of this
principle:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  An employee works a total of 48 hours in a particular
week and receives no pay for that w/w. He regularly receives a weekly salary of
$96 as ST payment for all hours in a week. For the w/w in question the
employee’s regular rate would be $2 an hour ($96 divided by 48 hours). He would
be due $2 an hour for the first 40 hours and $3 an hour for each hour over 40
or a total of $104 for the week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  An employee is paid $1.90 per hour and has 38 recorded
hours and has received $72.20 but has actually worked 44 hours. He would be due
$1.90 for the 39th hour, $1.90 for the 40th hour, and $2.85 for each additional
hour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
If the regular rate cannot be
determined as in (a) above, or if the regular rate so determined is less than
the legal minimum, the regular rate for OT purposes shall be the legal minimum
(see FOH 32j01 and 32j02).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32b01a            Hourly rate employees paid semimonthly or monthly.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>It
is permissible under the FLSA OT requirements for hourly rate employees to
receive semimonthly or monthly payments which include OT premium if the
requirements as described in FOH 32j11 are met.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32b02  Pieceworkers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When
an employee is employed on a piece rate basis, his regular hourly rate of pay
is computed by adding together his total weekly earnings from piece rates and
all other sources (such as production bonuses) and any sums paid for waiting
time or other hours worked (except statutory exclusions). This sum is then
divided by the number of hours worked in the week to yield the pieceworker’s
“regular rate” for that week. In some cases, the pieceworker is hired on a
piece rate basis with a minimum hourly guarantee. Where the total piece rate
earnings for the week fall short of the amount that would be earned for the
total hours at the guaranteed rate, the employee is paid the difference. In
those weeks in which the “make-up” payment is made, the employee is in fact
paid at an hourly rate and the minimum hourly guaranty which he was paid is his
regular rate for that week.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32b03  Day rates and job rates.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If
the employee is paid a flat sum for a day’ s work or for doing a particular job
without regard to the number of hours worked in the day or at the job, and if
he receives no other form of compensation for his services, his regular rate is
determined by totaling all the sums received in the workweek at the day or job
rates and dividing by the total hours actually worked.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32b04b            Irregular hours worked.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
If an employee is given a
stipulated salary with the understanding that it constitutes straight time pay
for all hours he works, and if his hours of work fluctuate from week to week,
his regular rate of pay ordinarily will vary from week to week in accordance
with the number of hours worked each week. The regular rate, of course, cannot
be less than the applicable MW. Since straight time compensation has already
been paid, such an employee must receive additional OT compensation for each OT
hour in a particular w/w computed at not less than one-half the regular rate
obtained by dividing the weekly salary by the number of hours worked in that
w/w. If the employer to avoid weekly computations chooses to pay extra
half-time based on the salary divided by 40 hours, such a method is permissible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The above rule will apply where an
employee works a varying number of hours, and normally receives his full salary
regardless of how few the scheduled hours may be in a particular week, even
though occasional disciplinary deductions for willful absence or tardiness are
made. Disciplinary deductions of course, may not cut into the MW or OT pay
required by the Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Similarly, an employee employed on
a fixed salary basis for irregular hours of work may be paid a pro rata share
of his salary in the initial or terminal week of his employment, when he is not
in payroll status for the entire week.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32b05  Employees employed at two rates.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
an employee in a single w/w works at two or more different types of work for
which different hourly rates at not less than the legal minimum have been
established, his regular rate for that week is the weighted average of the
rates; that is his total earnings (except statutory exclusions) at the
different rates are divided by the total number of hours he worked in the w/w.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32b06  Payments other than cash.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
employees are paid goods or facilities which are regarded as part of their
wages, the reasonable cost to the em­ployer of the goods or the facilities must
be included in the regular rate.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32b07  PM’s (push money) and other wage payments made by suppliers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Certain
retail establishment sales employees (for example, those who sell cosmetics and
related items) may receive, in addition to the wages paid by their employer,
payments from manufacturers or distributors for selling certain items or
brands. Such payments may be made directly to the sales employees or to the
employer for distribution to the employees. All such payments to employees for
their work are “wages” and must be recorded by the employer and included in the
regular rate of pay of the employees involved.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32b08  Annual salary earned in shorter period - regular rate.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Certain
employment such as that in schools does not normally constitute 12 months of
work each year. For the convenience of the employee, the annual salary earned
during the duty months is often paid in equal monthly installments throughout
the entire year. For purposes of finding the regular rate of pay for OT purpose
in such cases, the annual salary is considered in relation to the duty month
rather than in relation to the entire year. Thus, for example, a school bus
driver may receive an annual salary of $3000 for 10 months duty but be paid
equal monthly installments of $250 each. In such a case, he is considered as
being paid at the salary rate of $300 per month or $69.23 per week. The regular
rate for OT purposes is found in the usual manner based on this weekly salary.
(See FOH 22b11 and 30b18.)</p>

<h3>32c00  Bonuses as a part of the regular rate.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
FLSA Sec 7(e) requires the
inclusion in the regular rate of all remuneration for employment except seven
specified types of payments including certain bonuses. (For a discussion of
remuneration, other than bonuses, excludable from the regular rate, see FOH
32d.) Bonuses which do not qualify for exclusion from the regular rate must be
totaled with other earnings to determine the rate on which OT pay must be
based. (See IB 778.208.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Examples of bonuses which would
normally be included in the regular rate are</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  production bonuses,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  bonuses which are paid for performing work in less
than an established standard time,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  bonuses which are paid when certain types of
merchandise are sold through an employee’s effort,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  cost-of-living bonuses,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  attendance bonuses, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  bonuses paid as an incentive to attract employees to
an isolated or otherwise undesirable job site.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32c01  Discretionary bonuses.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Sums paid in recognition of
service performed during a given period need not be included in the regular
rate of pay if</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  both the fact that payment is to be made and the
amount of the payment are determined at the sole discretion of the employer at
or near the end of the period (regularity and/or repetitive payment of a bonus
is not in itself sufficient to destroy the discretionary character of a bonus),
and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  the payments are not made pursuant to any prior
contract, agreement, or prom­ise causing the employee to expect such payments
regularly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Where a substantial group of
employees receive uniform treatment in the actual payment of a bonus, the
statements of a scattered few will not be conclusive in determining whether
there is, or is not, a prior contract, agreement, or promise causing the
employee to expect such payments regularly. Statements must be taken from that
number of employees which will insure a preponderance of evidence on which a
proper decision can be made. Statements such as “I was told about the quarterly
bonus”, “When I was first employed I was told of this bonus”, “I believe that
Mr.----------told me about this bonus when I was hired”, or “When I was first
employed it was mentioned as a part of the pay I was to receive” are not in
themselves conclusive statements. Employee information should tell who made the
promise, under what circumstances, and whether any reassurances were received
at some later time.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32c02         Profit sharing plans or trusts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Payments
made to employees pursuant to a bona fide profit-sharing plan or trust which
meets the requirements of Reg 549 need not be included in the regular rate of
pay.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32c03         How a bonus is to be included in the regular rate.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
If a bonus covers only one weekly
pay period, the amount of the bonus is merely added to the other earnings of
the employee (except statutory exclusions) and the total divided by the total
hours worked by the employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Where the calculation of a bonus
is deferred over a period of time longer than one workweek, the employer may
disregard the bonus in computing the regular hourly rate until the amount of
the bonus can be ascertained.  At the time the amount of the bonus is
ascertained, it must be apportioned back over the workweeks of the period
during which it may be said to have been earned, so that the employee will
receive an additional amount of compensation for each week in which he worked
OT during the period. This additional amount will be based on one-half the
hourly rate of pay allocable to the bonus for that week multiplied by the
number of OT hours worked during the week</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
If it is impractical to allocate
the bonus among the workweeks of the period in proportion to the amount of the
bonus actually earned each week, some other reasonable and equitable method of
allocation should be adopted. For example, it may be assumed that the employee
earned an equal amount of bonus each hour worked in the bonus period. The
hourly increase is then determined by dividing the total bonus by the number of
hours worked by the employee du ring the period for which it is paid.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32c04  Distribution of bonuses as a percentage of total earnings or by
the boosted hour method.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Whether a bonus may be distributed
as a percentage of total earnings of each participating employee or by the
boosted hour method to achieve compliance with the OT provisions of the FLSA or
PCA, depends on whether the additional money to be paid is a true bonus or
whether it is a device to evade the payment of OT. If the so-called “regular
rate” of the employee is so low as to be obviously fictitious, the “bonus” in
all probability will be a part of the regular straight-time earnings upon which
OT compensation must be computed. On the other hand, if the additional money to
be paid is a true bonus, it may be distributed in proportion to the total
earnings (exclusive of the bonus) of each participating employee properly
computed to include time and one-half for the OT hours or in proportion to the
boosted hours worked during the bonus period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Extra payments not directly
related to hours worked, production, or efficiency, such as profit-sharing type
bonuses and year-end or Christmas bonuses which fail to meet the tests for
exclusion from the regular rate of pay under FLSA Sec 7 will generally be found
to be true bonuses. Production bonuses and labor saving bonuses present a more
difficult problem. For investigation purposes, if the Inv finds that such
additional payments periodically made are not merely devices for the
postponement of the full payment to the employees of their ordinary wage or
salary or devices for the perpetuation of an obsolete pay structure, he will be
justified in concluding that the payments are true bonuses. In this event, such
payments could be made as a percentage of total earnings or by the boosted hour
method. Evidence that the payment is not being used for evasive purposes may be
found in the fact that the wages otherwise paid to the employees are fair and
not out of line with wages which might ordinarily be expected to be paid for
the occupation in the locality. The determination should be based on the actual
or potential operation of the bonus plan during a reasonably extended series
for pay periods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Many employers distribute bonuses
on the basis of total straight time hours or earn­ings. If an investigation
discloses that a bonus has been distributed in this manner and OT has been
worked, the investigation will be handled as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  If the bonus is of the type not directly related to
hours worked, production or efficiency but which for some reason fails to
qualify for exclusion from the regular rate under Sec 7(e), no request for back
wages shall be made. In such cases the employer shall be informed of possible
Sec 16(b) liability and of the steps necessary to effect compliance. The number
of employees and the estimated amount of back wages shall not be shown on Form
WH-51. The narrative shall contain a concise statement of the facts. Where an
employee involved in such bonus payments is due back wages arising from other
causes, the payment of such of other back wages will be requested and
supervised.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  If the bonus is a production bonus, a cost of living
bonus or any other bonus directly related to hours worked, production or
efficiency, OT violations will be recorded and the employer will be requested
to pay the back wages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  In the case of either (1) or (2) above, it must be
kept in mind that the payments may be excludable under the provisions of FLSA
Sec 7(g)(3) - Reg 548.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32c05c Distribution according to length of service and similar factors.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Distribution of a total bonus may
also take into account such factors as length of service, attendance lateness,
production, efficiency, place of employment, job classifications, and the like.
For example, the gross earnings of each participating employee may be weighted
by multiplying them by a length of service factor such as 1.0 for one year, 1.1
for two years, 1.2 for three years, and so on. A total bonus can then be
distributed on a percentage basis to each individual member sharing in the
bonus by dividing the total weighted payroll of the participating employees
into the total bonus. If each participating employee is then paid as his share
this percentage of his total weighted earnings for the bonus period, the bonus
mathematically will include both straight-time and OT and the payment will be in
compliance with the FLSA and PCA. Such a bonus distribution may be based on
more than one such factor by multiplying the gross earning of each employee by
the additional factors and then determining each employee’s share as above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The weighting of employees’ gross
earnings to take into account length of service and similar factors is not invalid
provided it is not designed to circumvent the OT requirements of the FLSA or
PCA. It would, for example, be improper to apply a factor that decreases in
inverse proportion to the OT worked by various groups of employees. A “group”
to which a particular factor is to be applied may happen to include only one
employee and still be valid. However, it should be clear that the dollar amount
of the employee’s share of the total bonus has not been determined before
establishment of the value of the length of service or other factor that is
applied to his gross earnings. If the gross earnings of each of the
participating employees is weighted by a factor of different value, there would
be some evidence that the values of the factors had not been predetermined. In
any instance where there is a question. the Inv shall discuss his findings with
his FOS.</p>

<h3>32d00  Sums paid as gifts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sums
paid as gifts and payments in the nature of gifts are not a part of the regular
rate of pay, nor may they be credited toward OT compensation which may be due
an employee. To qualify for exclusion from the regular rate, the sum paid must
actually be paid as a gift or in the nature of a gift. If the amount of the
payment us measured by hours worked, production, or efficiency, the payment is
geared to wages and hours during the bonus period and so is not in the nature
of a gift. If the payment is made pursuant to a contract so that the employee a
legal right to bring suit to enforce it, or if the employees reasonably assume
or consider the payment to be a part of the wages for which they work, it is
not a gift or in the nature of a gift. If the sum is paid at Christmas or on
other special occasions and it is a bona fide gift or in the nature of a gift,
it may be excluded from the regular rate even though paid with regularity and
to different employees or groups in amounts which vary with the amounts of the
salaries or regular hourly rates of the employees or according to their length
of service.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32d01  Payments for suggestions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
There is no hard and fast rule on
payments for suggestions for the term suggestion plan has been used to describe
a variety of plans. Generally though, prizes paid pursuant to a bona fide
suggestion plan may be excluded from the regular rate at least in situations
where</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  the amount of the prize has no relation to the
earnings of the employee at his job, but is instead geared to the value to the
employer of the suggestion submitted, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  the prize represents a bona fide award for a
suggestion which is the result of additional effort or ingenuity unrelated to
and outside the scope of the usual and customary duties of any employee of the
class eligible to participate and the prize is not used as a substitute for
wages, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  no employee is required or specifically urged to
participate in the suggestion plan or led to believe that he will not merit
promotion or advancement (or retention of his existing job) unless he submits
suggestions, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  the invitation to employees to submit suggestions is
general in nature and no specific assignment is outlined to the employees,
either as individuals or as a group, to work on or develop, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  there is no time limit during which suggestions must
be submitted, and </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  the employer has, prior to the submission of the
suggestion by an employee, no notice or knowledge that an employee is preparing
a suggestion, and there are no circumstances indicating that the employer
approved the task and the schedule of work undertaken by the employee.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32d02  New business contest awards.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Employees are not required to be
credited with hours worked for time spent participating in a new business
contest, and prizes and awards received for such participation are not required
to be included in the employees’ regular rates of pay, provided the contest is
conducted under conditions which are substantially in accord with those set
forth below. Any major deviation therefrom might of course require a different
conclusion. (See IB 778.330-.333.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The contests are designed to obtain new business and
are of limited duration, frequently three months or less.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Participation is strictly voluntary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The activities of the employee in connection with the
contest do not involve significant amounts of time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Employees are regularly compensated for any time spent
on the contest during regular working time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  After hours solicitation is usually done among
friends, relatives, neighbors and acquaintances as a part of the employee’s
social activity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Door-to-door solicitation is prohibited.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  Awards for participation are provided under the
contest rules and may be in the nature of points to be accumulated toward
merchandise prices or cash payments.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32d03h            Fringe benefits paid in cash.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In
some cases employers pay their employees a proportionate part of certain fringe
benefits, such as vacation pay, sick leave and holiday pay in cash on each pay
day. This practice may be found in certain industries such as the construction
industry where the employee usually is employed by more than one employer
during the year. Such payments may be made, for example, as a certain number of
cents per hour or as a percentage of the hourly rate. Such payments may be
excluded from the regular rate under Sec 7(e)(2) provided (1) they represent
bona fide fringe benefits, (2) they are the cash equivalent of such benefits,
and (3) there is a clear understanding between the employer and employees that
the payments are in lieu of such fringe benefits. There should also be a
designation on the payroll records that such payments are in lieu of the
specific fringe benefits. However, the absence of such a designation per se
will not cause such otherwise bona fide fringe payments to be considered part
of the regular rate provided in fact that the tests set forth above are met.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32d04d            Rest period payments may be treated as call back
payments.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Premium
payments made solely because the employee has been called back to work before
the expiration of a so-called rest period between shifts or tours of duty may
be treated as call back payments and so excluded from the regular rate of pay.
However, since these payments are not for OT, but are made solely because of
the interruption of a rest period, they may not be offset against statutory OT.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32d05c            Employer’s share of board and lodging cost.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
employer’s share of the cost of board and lodging furnished employees need not
be included in the regular rate where it is similar to reimbursements for
expenses incurred by employees in traveling on the employer’s business. This
rule applies where the employees’ wage rates are not influenced by the
furnishing of board and lodging and where both parties understand the
employer’s share of the cost is not compensation for services or hours worked.
Examples are employees who maintain dual residences, such as barge workers and
mechanics who travel.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32d06  Benefit plans.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Contributions
irrevocably made by an employer to a trustee or third person pursuant to a bona
fide plan for providing old-age retirement, life, accident, health, or layoff
(such as the Ford-UAW Agreement) insurance or other similar benefits for
employees are excluded from the regular rate of pay. The requirements of a bona
fide benefit plan are set forth in IB 778.2l4 -.2l5.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32d07  Thrift and savings plans.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An
employer’s contributions to bona fide thrift or savings plans which meet the
requirements of Reg 547 need not be included in the regular rate of pay.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32d08b            Offsetting talent fees against OT.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Time
spent in earning talent fees outside of regular working hours need not be
included in determining the amount of OT compensation due if</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  the parties agree in advance of the program that a
special payment therefor shall include any increased statutory compensation
attributable to the additional worktime, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  the special payment, when made, is actually sufficient
in amount to include the statutory straight time and OT compensation due
computed without regard to the talent fees.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32d09  D-B Act fringe benefits payments.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Public Law 88-349 amends the D-B
Act and provides in certain circumstances for the inclusion by the Secretary of
the costs of fringe benefits in D-B prevailing wage determinations. It also
provides that the cost of such fringe benefits (or cash equivalent paid in lieu
of such benefits) shall be excluded from the regular rate under the FLSA, PCA,
and CWHSSA .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Subpart B of Reg 5 contains
interpretations of the fringe benefits provisions of the D-B Act, as amended.
If situations are encountered during FLSA or PCA investigations which involve
D-B fringe benefit payments and the question of whether or to what extent such
payments may be excluded from the regular rate cannot be resolved on the basis
of Reg 5, Subpart B (including situations where there is no concurrent coverage
but the employer asserts that fringe benefit payments are being made in
contemplation of D-B work), the matter shall be referred through channels to
the RA for an opinion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ADD
the following new Sec to text and Table of Contents</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32d10  Piece rate premium pay under Sec 7(e)(5).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Premium piece rate payments which
are clearly allocable exclusively to hours worked in excess of 8 per day or 40
per week or normal or regular working hours, as the case may be, may be
excluded from an employee’s regular rate of pay pursuant to Sec 7(e)(5). Such
premium rate payments may be in any amount in excess of the regular piece rate;
they do not have to be at a rate, for instance, of not less than one and
one-half times the regular piece rate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
An example of a piece rate payment
plan which does not include any premium payments excludable pursuant to Sec
7(e)(5) is one where the employee is paid a piece rate of 15¢ per unit for a
workday up to 9 hours a day; 17¢ per unit for a workday of between 9 and 10
hours; 18 ¢ per unit for a workday of between 10 and 11 hours; 19¢ per unit for
a workday of between 11 and 12 hours; 21¢ per unit for a workday of 12 or more
hours; and 21¢ per unit for Saturday and Sunday work, as such. Since the
foregoing rates are paid for all hours worked in the workday and not for work
performed outside of a standard specified in Sec 7(e)(5), no part of the
compensation paid may be excluded from the employee’s R/R</p>

<h3>32e00  Premium payments
for excessive hours.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Extra
compensation provided by a premium rate paid for certain hours worked by an
employee in any day or workweek because such hours are hours worked in excess
of 8 in a day or the applicable statutory maximum workweek, or in excess of the
employee’s normal or regular working hours, need not be included in the computation
of the employee’s rate of pay and may be credited toward OT compensation due
under the FLSA or PCA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32e01  Valid hours
standards.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Where the payment of a premium
rate for work is made contingent upon prior work for a specified number of
hours in the day, or hours or days in the workweek, that daily or weekly
standard will be accepted as meeting the requirements of FLSA Sec 7(e)(5), if
it qualifies as any one of the following standards:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Statutory standard - a standard working day of 8 hours
or a standard workweek of the applicable statutory maximum workweek. OT
payments for standards in excess of 8 a day or the applicable statutory maximum
workweek will also be recognized; for example, OT payments after 9 actual
working hours a day are recognized as OT payments under Sec 7(e)(5) even though
9 hours are not the employee’s normal or regular working hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Regular working hours standard - a standard which
coincides with the employee’s regular hours or days of work during the period
covered by the investigation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Normal working hours standard - a standard which
coincides with the employee’s normal hours or days of work as established by
agreement or practice, even though abnormal conditions have resulted in the
employee regularly working for some time hours in excess of the standard. The
standard will be considered to coincide with the employee’s normal hours or
days of work where</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
the facts indicate that the
standard coincided with the employee’s regular working hours or days in the
past, that the regular working of excess hours or days at present is due to
emergency or transitory conditions which are not expected to be permanent and
that the parties intend again to observe the specified standard as the normal
working hours or days as soon as conditions permit, there being no inconsistent
guarantee of employment or pay for hours or days in excess of the standard; or,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
the employee’s regular working
hours or days have in the past exceeded the standard but it appears certain,
after considering all of the available evidence, that the standard was adopted
and is being applied with the bona fide intention of establishing it as the
normal daily or weekly working period to which the regular hours or days will
be conformed as soon as the necessary adjustments can practicably be made,
there being no inconsistent guarantee of employment or pay for hours or days in
excess of the standard.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32e02  Questionable hours standard.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
alleged daily or weekly hours standards differ from the applicable statutory
standard, they shall be carefully scrutinized to determine whether they are in
fact bona fide standards within the criteria outlined in FOH 32e01. This is
especially true of alleged daily standards of less than 8 hours and alleged
weekly standards of less than the applicable statutory maximum workweek where
the investigation discloses that the regular working hours per day or per week
are in excess of the alleged standard. Where there is any doubt concerning the
validity of the standard, the matter shall be referred to the RD for a
determination on the basis of the facts submitted by the Inv and his FOS, and
any other facts relating to the particular establishment or industry which may
be available to the RD.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32e03  Offset of premium payments for excessive hours.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
premium rates are paid for hours in excess of a valid hours standard, the
amount of the premium payment may be offset against statutory OT compensation
due, regardless of whether such extra compensation is provided by a premium
rate of 1 l/3, 1 1/2, double, or some other multiple of the non-OT rate of pay.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32e04  Premium rates for specified days.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Extra compensation provided by a
premium rate paid for work by an employee on Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, or
regular days of rest, or on the sixth or seventh day of the workweek, where the
premium rate is not less than one and one-half times the rate established in
good faith for like work performed in non-OT hours on other days, need not be
included in computing the regular rate of pay and may be offset against OT
compensation due under the FLSA or PCA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Where the premium rates paid for
work on Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, or regular days of rest, or on the sixth
or seventh day of the workweek are at less than time and one-half, the extra
compensation may be excluded from the regular rate only if the premium rates
meet the tests of an excessivity premium.</p>

<h3>32f00   General rule.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Extra
compensation provided by a premium rate paid to an employee pursuant to an
applicable employment contract or collective bargaining agreement for work
outside of the hours established in good faith by the contract or agreement as
the basic, normal, or regular workday (not exceeding 8 hours) or workweek (not
exceeding the applicable statutory maximum workweek), where that premium rate
is not less than one and one-half times the rate established in good faith by
the contract or agreement for like work performed during the workday or
workweek, need not be included in computing the regular rate of pay and may be
offset against OT compensation due under the FLSA. The basic workday or
workweek, if established in good faith by contract or agreement, need not coincide
with the normal or regular workday or workweek. Such a basic workday or
workweek may be established in situations where there is no normal or regular
workday or workweek.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32f01   Effect of regular practice where agreement does not specifically
designate an hours standard workday.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
fact that a collective bargaining or employment agreement does not specify the
exact hours that are to constitute the workday does not preclude application of
FLSA Sec 7(e)(7), nor is it necessary that the contract or agreement
specifically provide for premium pay for hours “outside the workday”. If in
practice the parties have arranged for payment of not less than time and
one-half a bona fide rate for hours outside of a workday, the practice will be
deemed to modify the terms of the original contract or agreement . For example,
if a contract provides for payment of time and one-half for hours beyond 8 in a
day or 40 in a week, but in practice the employees normally work from 8 a. m.
to 5 p.m. with 1 hour for lunch, the payment of time and one-half for the hours
before 8 a.m. and after 5 p.m. will be accepted as compliance with FLSA Sec
7(e)(7). Furthermore, where the scheduled hours of the workday vary from time
to time because of unforeseen contingencies, this fact does not preclude the
acceptance of such a workday as an established workday under Sec 7(e)(7). Where
the above conditions are met, the OT premiums are valid under Sec 7(e)(7)
regardless of the number of hours during the basic, normal workday or workweek.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32f02   Employment contract.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Whereas a collective bargaining
agreement is generally a formal agreement which has been reduced to writing, an
employment contract may be either written or oral.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Where there is a written
employment contract and the practices of the parties differ from its’
provisions, it must be determined whether the practices of the parties have
modified the contract. If the practices of the parties have modified the
written provisions of the contract, the practices of the parties will be controlling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The determination as to the
existence of an applicable oral employment contract will be based on all of the
facts, including the terms of the oral contract and the actual employment and
pay practices</p>

<h3>32g00  FLSA Section 7(f).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
FLSA Sec 7(f) provides that no
employer shall be deemed to have violated the overtime provisions of the FLSA
by employing an employee for a workweek in excess of the applicable statutory
OT standard</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  if the employee is employed pursuant to a bona fide
individual contract, or pursuant to an agreement made as a result of collective
bargaining by representatives of employees,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  if the duties of such employees necessitate irregular
hours of work, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  if the contract or agreement</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
specifies a regular rate of pay
which is not less than the applicable legal minimum,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
provides for compensation at an OT
rate which is not less than one and one-half times the specified rate for all
hours worked in excess of the applicable statutory OT standard in any workweek,
and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
provides a weekly guaranty of pay
covering compensation based on the specified regular and OT rates for not more
than 60 hours .</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32g01  Contract or agreement.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Employers should be encouraged to
reduce FLSA Sec 7(f) contracts to writing, since a contract of this nature is
complicated and proof both of its existence and of its compliance with the
requirement of Sec 7(f) may be difficult if it is an oral contract. It should
be kept in mind that Reg 516.24(c) requires, in the case of an oral agreement,
that a written memorandum summarizing the terms of the 7(f) agreement be made
by the employer. Failure to maintain such a written memorandum would result in
a recordkeeping violation but would not of itself invalidate an otherwise valid
7(f) contract or agreement. It may, however, in conjunction with other factors
point toward either the invalidity or nonexistence of such an agreement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
A contract cannot be a one-sided
affair. Therefore, the employee must not only be aware of, but must have agreed
to, the method of compensation in advance of his performance of the work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The contract whether oral or
written must provide for compliance with all of the requirements of FLSA Sec
7(f), and where there is a change in the specified rate or the number of hours
for which pay is guaranteed, the contract must be amended accordingly.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32g02  Irregular hours.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Contracts under FLSA Sec 7(f) may
be made only with, or by their representatives on behalf of, employees whose
duties necessitate irregular hours of work. In this connection, there is
nothing in the FLSA which makes the Sec 7(f) exemption inapplicable to any
class of employees. Whether or not the duties of employees necessitate
irregular hours of work must be decided on the facts of employment as to such
employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The following situations do not
permit a finding that the employee’s hours are in fact irregular:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The fluctuation results entirely from absences of the
employee for reasons other than the nature of his duties, such as absences due
to illness, vacation, holidays, and the like.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The fluctuation results because the employee works
fixed workweeks of different lengths. This would include situations where the
fixed workweeks of longer length occur during seasonal peaks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The only fluctuation is minor or insignificant. The
terms minor and insignificant shall be understood to mean fluctuations of 4 or
less hours between the lowest number of hours worked and the highest number of
hours worked in any year or where the fluctuations, even though beyond this
range are only occasional.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The fluctuation, (even though more than occasional,
minor or insignificant) occurs exclusively or nearly so in the hours above the
applicable statutory OT standard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Where irregular hours are worked
during most of the contract period, the irregular hours of work criterion will
be met even though there are periods in which regular hours are worked.
Likewise, where irregular hours are worked during the entire period, a single
Sec 7(f) contract or agreement covering the entire period may be proper even
though hours fluctuated at a low level during the slack season and at a high
level during the busy season. In the latter case, it is possible also to have
two Sec 7(f) contracts, one for the busy season and one for the slack season. A
further discussion with reference to irregular hours is contained in IB
778.405.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32g03  Agreements covering more than one employee.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
In the case of a group of
employees similarly situated with respect to the kind or nature of the work
they do, a contract may be set up with the same provisions for all individuals
in the group.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
In determining the validity of the
agreement with respect to any individual employee in a group, the experience of
the group as a whole should be considered together with the experience of the
individual employee. Where the experience of the individual is found to meet
all the tests of a valid Sec 7(f) contract, the contract will be considered
valid for him. However, the fact that an individual, who is a member of a group
failed for a particular period to work hours which in fact are irregular does
not necessarily invalidate his contract if it can be concluded that, on the
basis of the experience of the group, it can be “reasonably expected” that he
will meet this test.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32g04  Payment of the guaranty and for hours in excess of
guaranty-deductions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
To meet the requirement. for the
payment of not less than time and one-half for hours over the applicable
statutory OT standard in the workweek, the employee must be paid the full
amount of the guaranty (except as provided in (b) below) for every workweek,
however short, in which he performs any amount of work for the employer. In
addition, the employee must be paid time and one-half the specified rate for
all hours actually worked in excess of the number of hours covered by the
guaranty. As a general rule, failure to pay such additional OT for excess hours
will preclude the application of FLSA Sec 7(f).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The following types of deductions
may be made without affecting the validity of a Sec. 7(f) plan. In each case,
however, it will be necessary to review the circumstances carefully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Deductions to cover the cost to the employer of
furnishing board, lodging, and other facilities within the meaning of FLSA Sec
3(m).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Deductions authorized by the employee, such as union
dues, or required by law, such as taxes and garnishments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Disciplinary deductions for time during which an
employee willfully refuses to perform available work.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32g05  Regular rate in relation to guaranty - “excessivity” standard not
controlling.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As
a result of judicial decisions, the failure of the pay arrangement to meet the
“excessivity” standard referred to in IB 778.408 and 778.410-.414 is no longer considered
sufficient in itself to be a controlling criterion in testing the validity of a
Sec 7(f) contract. In substance, the “excessivity” standard contemplated that
the relationship between the hourly rate specified in the contract and the
amount of the guaranty must be such that the employee would have worked or
could reasonably have been expected to work sufficient hours to earn in excess
of the guaranty in a significant number of weeks and thus demonstrate that the
regular rate was designed to be operative in controlling the compensation. The
weight to be given to a failure to meet this standard will depend on all the
facts and the total situation. While the courts have declined to accept the
view that validity of a pay arrangement under Sec 7(f) may be tested by this
standard alone, the factors involved still may have evidential bearing, at
least in conjunction with other pertinent considerations, on the bona fides of
the contract. In situations where the fluctuations in weekly hours seem plainly
unrelated to the guaranteed contract hours (for example, the employee’s hours
ordinarily fluctuate between 35 and 45 or 50 but the contract guaranty covers
60 hours), the bona fides of the contract are subject to doubt . It is unlikely
that under a bona fide contract an employer will pay week after week for more
hours than actually worked.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32g06  Guaranty of pay for not more than 60 hours in a workweek.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The guaranty must be a weekly
guaranty. A guaranty of monthly, semimonthly, or biweekly pay does not qualify
under FLSA Sec 7(f). However, the weekly guarantee may be paid every 2 weeks,
or at the end of a semimonthly or monthly pay period for all workweeks ending
within the pay period. (See FOH 32j11.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The contract must provide a
guaranty of pay, and the amount must be specified. A mere guaranty to provide
work for a particular number of hours is not sufficient. The pay guaranteed
must be for not more than 60 hours based on specified rates.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32g07  Computations, invalid Sec 7( f) plans.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Where it is found that a
guaranteed weekly wage plan does not meet the requirements of FLSA Sec 7(f)
during a particular period of time for a particular employee, a violation will
exist for that employee and the total amount of his guaranteed wage as
specified in the contract or agreement determines his regular rate of pay
during the period of violation. In any week in the violation period for which
it is necessary to compute his regular rate of pay for OT purposes, the rate
shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  In workweeks not exceeding the guaranteed number of
hours, the total amount of the guaranty shall be divided by the number of hours
actually worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  In workweeks exceeding the number of hours covered by
the guaranty, the guaranteed salary shall be divided by the guaranteed number
of hours. Compensation received by the employee for work in excess of the
guaranty may, of course, be offset against the amount found due by computing
his earnings on the regular rate of pay calculated as explained above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Illustration:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A
Sec 7(f) plan has been determined to be invalid for a particular employee. The
rate specified in the contract or agreement is $4.00 per hour and a guaranty of
$220.00 to cover ST and OT compensation for 50 hours is provided. No bonuses or
other additions to wages are paid to the employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  In a week in which he worked 45 hours the employee’s
regular rate of pay would be $220.00 divided by 45 hours, or $4.88. In addition
to the $220.00 already paid to him under his guaranty, he would be entitled to
receive half-time for the five OT hours, or $12.20.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  In a week in which the employee worked 50 hours, the
number of hours for which pay was guaranteed, his regular rate would be $220.00
divided by 50 hours, or $4.40. He would be entitled to receive an additional
$22.00 for the 10 OT hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  In a week in which the employee worked 55 hours and
received under his contract or agreement the total amount of $250.00 ($220.00
under his guaranty and $20.00 as ST pay and $10.00 as OT premium for the five
additional hours) his regular rate of pay would still be determined by dividing
the amount of his guaranty, $220.00 by the number of hours for which pay was
guaranteed, 50 hours. His regular rate for that week would thus again be $4.40
and total compensation due would be ($220.00 + $22.00) + (5 X 1-1/2 X $4.40) or
$275.00. BW due would be $275.00 - $250.00 or $25.00.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The illustrations in (b) above
merely state the principle involved. The actual computation should be made by
use of the coefficient table as appropriate. (See “Transcription and
Computation Short Cuts for Overtime”.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32g08  Sec 7(f) plans and the PCA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A
Sec 7(f) plan which is found to be valid may continue to operate during periods
in which the work of the employee is subject to the provisions of the PCA,
provided that during those periods the employer complies with the MW and OT
provisions of the PCA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32g09  Exempt workweeks.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An
otherwise valid Sec 7(f) contract will not be invalidated because of the
failure to pay time and a half for the hours in excess of the contract maximum
hours in weeks in which the employer has availed himself of an applicable OT
exemption.</p>

<h3>32h00  General provisions of FLSA Secs 7(g)(1) and 7(g)(2).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
FLSA Secs 7(g)(1) and 7(g) (2)
provide exceptions from the OT requirements of FLSA Sec 7(a) in the case of:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  an employee employed at piece rates, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  an employee performing two or more kinds of work for
which different hourly or piece rate, have been established, provided</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
the payments are made pursuant to
an agreement or understanding arrived at between the employer and the employee
before performance of the work,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
the OT rate is not less than one
and one-half times the bona fide rate applicable to the same work when
performed during non-OT hours,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
the number of daily or weekly OT
hours, for which such OT compensation is paid, equals or exceeds the number of
hours worked in excess of the applicable statutory maximum workweek by the
employee in the workweek,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
the employee’s average hourly
earnings for the workweek, exclusive of payments described in clauses (1)
through (7) of FLSA Sec 7(e), are not less than the minimum hourly rate
required by applicable law, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
extra OT compensation is computed
and paid on other forms of additional pay required to be included in computing
the regular rate.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32h01  Prior agreement or understanding.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
FLSA specifies that an agreement or understanding must be reached before the
performance of the work.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32h02  Two or more kinds of work for which different rates of pay have
been established.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Whether or not an employee is
performing two or more different kinds of work for which different straight
time piece rates or hourly rates have been established must be determined on
the basis of all the facts in each instance. The following are considered to be
different rates of pay for different types of work for purposes of Secs 7(g)(1)
or 7(g)(2):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Differential rates for night shift and Sunday work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Differential rates for hazardous work, such as
differential rates in construction based on height.</p>

<h3>32h03  Bona fide rates - FLSA Sec 7(g)(1) and 7(g)(2).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>IB
778.418(a)(4) and 778.419(a) (3) provide that a piece rate or hourly rate will
be regarded as a ‘bona fide” rate for OT purposes if it meets the MW
requirements and is the rate “actually paid” for the particular kind of work
during nonovertime hours. However, situations may arise where the particular
kind of work for which the rate has been established is performed only during
OT hours. In such cases, and if the MW requirement is met, the rate established
for this work will be considered bona fide for OT purposes provided it is the
rate which would be paid for the particular kind of work should it be performed
during nonovertime hours. For example, a rate of $2 an hour (which is equal to
or in excess of the rate normally paid) may be established for janitorial work
in a welding shop under an arrangement whereby the work will be done by certain
of the shop welders, whose welding rate is $3 an hour. (The prior understanding
of the parties is that this different kind of work will be performed by the
welders at the $2 rate and OT paid at 1½ the rate which is applicable to the
work performed during OT hours.) If the circumstances are such that the welders
perform the janitorial work only in their OT hour., the $2 rate shall be
considered a bona fide rate for OT purposes provided it is the rate which would
have been paid to the welders had they performed the janitorial work in
nonovertime hours. The fact that the janitorial rate in this instance is 2/3 of
the welding rate (thus making the time and one-half OT rate for janitorial work
equal to the straight time rate for welding work) is not material so long as
the janitorial rate is a bona fide rate.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32h04  Overtime compensation on other forms of pay.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
the FLSA Secs 7(g)(1) and (2) methods of compensating for OT are used, extra OT
compensation must be properly computed and paid on other forms of additional
compensation required to be included in computing the regular rate.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32h05  Number of hours for which compensation is due.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
the hours, for which OT is paid under FLSA Secs 7(g)(1) and (2), qualify as OT
hours under FLSA Secs 7(e)(5), (6), or (7), the requirements of FLSA Sec 7 will
be met if the number of those hours equals or exceeds the number of hours
worked in excess of the applicable statutory maximum in the workweek. It is not
necessary to determine whether the total amount of compensation paid for such
hours equals or exceeds the amount of compensation which would be due at the
applicable rates for work performed during the hours after the applicable
statutory maximum in any workweek.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32h06  Computation under FLSA Sec 7( g)(2) when one of the rates is
averaged.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
computation of OT under FLSA Sec 7(g)(2) when one of the rates is averaged may
best be shown by an illustration. Assume that an employee works 42 hours at a
piece rate and 4 hours at an hourly rate. Payment of OT for the 2 piece rate OT
hours at one -half the employee‘s average piece rate earnings for the workweek
and 4 hours at time and one-half the hourly rate will be acceptable as a proper
payment of OT.</p>

<h3>32i00   General provisions of FLSA Sec 7(g)(3).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sec
7(g)(3) permits the payment of OT compensation based on a rate not less than
one and one -half times the rate established by agreement or understanding
arrived at between the employer and the employee before performance of the
work, if the rate is authorized by Reg 548.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32i01   Payments under Regulations, Part 548.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Reg 548 provides for the exclusion
of certain “additional” payments in cash or in kind which would have a trivial
effect on OT compensation and which would otherwise require prorating over a
retroactive period to compute the OT due. Exclusions are limited to
“additional” or “incidental” payments; payments which are an “integral part” of
the employee’s regular wages may not be excluded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
As a general rule, payments which
are regularly paid on every payday are not excludable as they are not
“additional”, but an integral part of the employee’s regular wages.
Furthermore, the mere fact that payments are deferred to a future time will not
make them excludable as additional payments if they amount to nothing more than
an increase in the rate per hour or per piece. An exception is made for
payments in kind and certain cash payments, such as Social Security taxes which
are excludable even if paid every payday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
An “additional” payment within the
meaning of the Reg generally is one which is made on a different basis from
that which determines the wages to which the employee is regularly entitled and
is not regularly made every payday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
The following types of payment may
be excluded if the 50 cents condition and the requirements of 548.2 are met:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Prizes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Merchandise awards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Housing of nominal value.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Lunches.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Social Security taxes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Flat sum payments or retroactive rate increase made as
the result of an increase in the cost of living.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  Retroactive wage increases.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)  Payments made as a reward for attendance paid
periodically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9)  Individual or group production bonuses which are not
earned every payday and are paid on a basis other than the employee’s regular
wages</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
The following types of payment are
not excludable even if the other conditions are met:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Night shift differentials. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Higher rates paid as premium pay for non-OT hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Rate increases which become effective after a rise in
the cost of living.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Commissions and incentive or production bonuses earned
regularly every payday which are an integral part of the employee’s wage
structure.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32i02   Public agencies may utilize Sec 7(g).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Public
agencies, including public agencies engaged in fire protection or law
enforcement activities, may utilize Sec 7(g) in the same manner as employers in
the private sector. (See IB 778.400, 778.401, 778.415 thru 778.421, and Reg
548.)</p>

<h3>32j00   Multiple minima where records do not show segregation.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In
those cases where different wage rates are applicable under the FLSA-PCA-SCA,
and records are not kept showing the time worked at each rate, for the purpose
of computing OT payments under the FLSA-PCA the regular rate of pay under the
FLSA or the basic hourly rate under the PCA cannot be lower than the highest MW
rate applicable.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j01   Multiple minima under State, Territorial, and U.S. laws.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If
no OT has been worked in a w/w, no attempt shall be made to enforce any other
State, Territorial, or Federal MW higher than that provided under the
FLSA-PCA-SCA. If OT has been worked, the regular rate of pay for OT purposes
under FLSA-PCA cannot be lower than the applicable State, Territorial, or
Federal MW, whichever is higher. However, Inv’s shall not interpret any law
other than that administered by Wage-Hour. Thus, if it is not clear that such a
higher MW rate applies, the Inv shall accept the payroll rate shown (if it is
at least that required by FLSA-PCA-SCA) in determining OT compensation due. Any
question as to a possible violation of some other statutes should be referred
to the appropriate authorities in accordance with regular procedures.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j02   Straight time compensation to be paid in full.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If
an employee who is paid an hourly rate works statutory OT hours (whether or not
the employer recognized them as OT hours), the employer must pay the employee
for all hours worked at the agreed rate plus at least an extra half-time that
rate for all OT hours less the total wages actually paid.  Before an employee
can be said to be paid OT compensation due, he must be paid his ST compensation
due for all hours worked under any express or implied contract or under any
applicable statute. (See Reg 778.315). Where an employer has an express or
implied agreement with an employee over a deduction policy covering particular
items, then bona fide deductions pursuant to the policy will be  allowed during
OT workweeks if the requirements of FOH 32j08 are met.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j03   Owner-operators of equipment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
In the case of nonexempt operators
who own and operate their own equipment (trucks, scrapers, mules, horses, etc.)
as employees of the persons or companies for whom they perform the work,
whenever separate rates have not been established for the rental of equipment
and for the labor, or when such separate rates, if made, appear to be
unreasonable or disproportionate, the following rates shall be deemed to have
been paid as wages:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  the regular hourly rate being paid by the same
employer to operators of similar company- owned equipment, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  where the regular hourly rate noted in the foregoing
clause (1) is not available the rate usually paid in the area to operators of
similar company-owned equipment, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  when rates noted in foregoing clauses (1) or (2) are
not available, a percentage formula such as 80% rent and 20% wages, or 75%-25%
or some similar formula should be used. When it is necessary to use a formula
of this type, one should be selected which will result in a reasonable relation
between the cost of renting equipment and the wages paid to operators.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Wherever possible, clause (1)
above shall be followed. Clause (2) shall be followed only when clause (1)
cannot be used, and clause (3) shall be used only as a last resort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
In order to be in compliance in
the future, particularly as to the record-keeping regulations, employers shall
be required to break down the compensation paid into labor rates and equipment
rental. By agreement with the employees involved, separate rates shall be
established for the rental of the equipment and for the labor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
The separate rates for labor and
equipment rentals thus established, wherever they appear unreasonable or
disproportionate, shall be scrutinized for possible evasion of the OT
requirements of the FLSA or PCA. Such evasions might be evident, for example,
if the rates set up for labor of an owner-operator are grossly out-of-line with
the rate paid by the same employer to operators of similar company-owned
equipment or with the prevailing rate in the area for such operators. It may be
found that in breaking down the rates which covered both the equipment and
labor, the employer has allocated an unreasonable or disproportionate part of the
rate to the equipment rental with the intent of diminishing the regular rate of
pay on which OT has to be computed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
The half time OT premium on a
regular rate determined as above shall be paid in addition to the total
contract earnings and may not be charged to or deducted from equipment
earnings.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j04   Wage raises cannot cover overtime.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Payments
made to employees cannot be wage or salary increases and extra compensation for
OT at the same time. Where additional amounts are paid without any understanding
that they are OT compensation, and the payment of such amounts remains constant
even during weeks in which the employee works no OT, the payments are in fact
wage or salary increases and must necessarily be reflected in an increase in
the employee’s regular hourly rate of pay rather than as an offset against
extra compensation due for OT.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j05   Changes in scheduled hours without change in pay.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Permanent reduction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  A permanent reduction in a fixed schedule of workweek
hours without a reduction in the salary or take-home pay results in an
increased regular rate. Where the employer has continued to use the original
rate in computing OT, a violation shall be charged. However, where such a
violation resulted from a genuine misunderstanding of the OT requirements, no
request for payment of back wages shall be made. The employees involved and the
amount of beck wages shall not be reported on Form WH-51. A brief explanation shall
be made in the narrative. The employer shall be advised of the rights of
employees under Sec 16(b).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The following conditions will be indicative of a
genuine misunderstanding:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
It is clear that there was
compliance before the change, that is, the rates then used for straight time
and OT purposes were bona fide and properly paid; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
the reduction in hours without a
reduction in take-home pay was intended to and did benefit the employees; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
there was no intention to evade
the payment of the OT premium required by the Act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The employer shall be advised that the payment of the
same take-home pay for the reduced workweek establishes an increased regular
rate of pay which must be used to compute OT compensation for all statutory OT
hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Temporary or
seasonal-reduction.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  As a general rule, a reduction in a fixed schedule of
workweek hours without reduction in salary or take-home pay for all weeks of a
specified period of definite and reasonably long duration, such as a seasonal
slack period, will result in an increased regular rate, as in the case of a
permanent reduction. The policy set forth in (a) above will be followed as to
the requirements for future compliance and in making the determination as to
whether to request payment of back wages in such cases.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Where employees are given time off on a temporary
basis such as all Saturdays or some part of them in the summer months, or other
bona fide seasonal vacation periods, without reduction of salary or take-home
pay, the time off will be regarded as vacation time within the meaning of Sec
7(e)(2). Thus, the pay for such time off will not affect the regular rate of
pay. Likewise, there would be no violation of the Act if the employer required
the employees to work those hours which were scheduled as vacation time off,
without paying them additional compensation. The same result would follow if a
half day off was given every other Saturday during the period of Daylight
Saving Time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Permanent schedule of
alternating workweek, of different fixed lengths. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
an employer has established a permanent schedule of alternating workweeks of
different fixed lengths he/she may, by agreement or understanding with the
employee, pay the same straight-time compensation for the scheduled hours of
the “long” and “short” workweeks, but he/she may not pay the same fixed salary
for the long and short schedules of hours to cover total compensation including
the </p>
<p> </p>
<p>OT
pay. The payment of the same straight-time compensation for the scheduled long
and short workweeks establishes different rates of pay for the long and short
scheduled workweek. If in such a case the employer has p id the same total
compensation for both the long and short scheduled workweeks the policy
expressed in (a) above will be followed.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j06   Lump-sum overtime payment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Under
appropriate circumstances, and where close scrutiny reveals there is a clear
understanding between the employer and the employee that a lump-sum payment is
predicated on at least time and one-half tbe established rate, and that OT payment
is clearly intended, the fact that the payment is a lump sum will not result in
a violation if it equals or exceeds the proper OT payment due. For example,
during a limited period each year hourly-rated employees worked after regular
hours on a special job for their employer. Under a clearly understood agreement
with his/her employees, the employer, based on experience paid for this special
job in a lump sum arrived at by computing time and one-half the regular rate
for the estimated special job hours, and then adding an additional bonus
amount. This policy shall be applied very narrowly and shall not be applied to
lump-sum payments which are nothing more than bonuses for working undesirable
hours.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j07   Retroactive increases.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
If retroactive increases are given
as compensation for services, they must be included in determining the
employee’s regular rate of pay and must be prorated over the previous weeks in
which the work, to which the compensation is attributed, was performed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
If it is not feasible to allocate
the retroactive increases among the workweeks of the period in proportion to
the amount of the increases actually applicable to each week, some other
reasonable and equitable method of allocation must be adopted. For example, it
may be assumed that the employee earned an equal amount of the increase each
hour of the pay period and so the resultant hourly increase may be determined
by dividing the total amount of increase by the number of hours worked by the
employee during the period for which it is paid.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j08   Deductions in overtime weeks.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
(FLSA Sec 7 (a) requires that an
employee receive compensation for OT hours at “a rate not less than one and
one-half times the regular rate at which he/she is employed”. Where board,
lodging, and facilities are charged to the employee and the employer recovers
the amount by deductions from the employee’s cash wages, the regular rate is
determined before the deductions are made. There is no limit to the amount
which may be deducted for these items, provided that the deductions are
confined to the reasonable cost of the board and lodging furnished. Where such
deductions are in amounts which exceed the “reasonable cost”, the excess amount
shall be handled the same as deductions for items other than “board, lodging,
or other facilities”. The term “other facilities” means such items as meals
furnished at company restaurants, housing furnished, general merchandise bought
at company stores (including food, clothing, and household effects), and fuel,
electricity, water, and gas furnished for the personal use of the employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Employers must pay
statutorily-required MW and OT premium pay finally and unconditionally, or
“free and clear.” The cost of furnishing items that are primarily for the
benefit or convenience of the employer do not qualify as “facilities” under
FLSA section 3(m); thus they may not be included as part of wages due. 
Further, deductions for articles that do not qualify as “board, lodging, or
other facilities” under FLSA section 3(m), such as tools, equipment, cash
register shortages, and other similar items, may not be made if they cut into
required MW or OT premium pay. Deductions that reduce an employee’s average
hourly earnings for the workweek after the deductions to less than the highest
applicable MW rate are illegal in an OT week unless the law establishing that
MW (e.g., State law, DBRA, SCA, H-2A, H-1B, H-2B, or a MSPA contracted
“promised wage”) allows the particular deduction. (NOTE: If a MSPA contract
specifically discloses that the employer will make certain particularized
deductions not other prohibited by other law, those deductions would be
permitted. For example, if a MSPA-covered employer disclosed a wage rate of
$8.00/hour and fully disclosed in writing at the time of recruitment that
$1.50/hour would be deducted for non-3(m) items, and the deductions are
otherwise legal and not prohibited by other applicable laws, then those
fully-disclosed deductions are permitted to reduce the hourly wage to below the
$8.00/hour contracted “promised wage” (i.e. to $6.50/hour). Deductions for
non-3(m) items may be made in an OT workweek to the same extent as permitted in
a non-OT workweek if their purpose and effect are not to evade the OT
requirements of the FLSA or other law, and if they are bona fide deductions
made for particular items according to a prior agreement or understanding
between the employer and the employee before the work is performed (Regs
531.37(a) and 778.315).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
If an employer and an employee
have an express or implied agreement about a deduction policy for particular
items, then bona fide deductions pursuant to the policy will be allowed during
an OT workweek to the extent that they would be allowed in a non-OT workweek,
provided that the deductions do not violate other applicable laws (e.g., State
law), the employee receives “free and clear” the highest applicable MW
(including prevailing wages) required by any Federal, State or local law for
the non-OT hours, and the employee receives time and one-half the regular rate
of pay based on the stipulated wage, before any deductions are made, for all
the OT hours. For example, if a forestry worker subject to a $9.00 per hour SCA
prevailing WD is paid $10.00 per hour ($1.00 above the legally-required SCA WD
rate of $9.00) and works 50 hours in a particular workweek, the most that may
be deducted from this worker’s wages for that week pursuant to a prior
agreement covering specific deductions (e.g. purchase of a saw) is 40 times
$1.00 ($40.00). (Statutory wages due net after deductions = [40x$9.00 ($360.00
MW]+[(10 x 1.50 x $10.00 ($150.00 OT)] or $510.00 total MW &amp; OT.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Unless there is an agreement as to
deductions for particular items, or if the employer reduces an employee’s wages
for a reason not addressed in the contractual arrangement or for no legitimate
reason, the deductions will be considered illegal and will not be allowed
during OT workweeks. To determine if these criteria are met, apply the
following standards:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Deductions must be made for particular items according
to an agreement or understanding between the parties:  The agreement must be
reached before the employee performs the work that becomes subject to the
deductions. The agreement must be specific concerning the particular items for
which the deductions will be made, and the employee must know how the amount of
the deductions will be determined that are included in the agreement (e.g.,
cash register shortages). The employee must affirmatively agree or assent to
the employer’s deduction policy. While the employee’s assent to the policy may
be written or unwritten, the employer bears the burden of proof that an
employee has agreed to the deduction policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Only bona fide deductions, made for particular items,
are permitted:  Deductions that are otherwise prohibited by other laws or
authority (Federal, State or local) are not bona fide (e.g., if a State law
prohibits any deductions from employees’ wages for tools and similar items or
equipment that are business expenses of the employer, WH would not allow any
deductions in that State in an OT workweek, regardless of whether the highest
WH-enforced MW was paid (net) after the deductions). Deductions for amounts
above the reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing a particular item to an
employee are also not bona fide (e.g., furnishing items to employees “at a
profit”; deductions for substandard housing). Deductions from wages where no
prior agreement exists as to particular items are never permitted in an OT
workweek.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The regular rate of pay is based on the stipulated
wage before any deductions are made:  Deductions for non-3(m) items that reduce
an employee’s rate of pay to below the highest applicable legally-required MW
are illegal unless the law establishing that MW allows the particular
deductions. In OT workweeks (where OT requirements apply), deductions may be
made according to an agreement that reduce the effective hourly rate down to
the highest required MW, but only from the non-OT hours (first 40 hours in the
week). Proper time and one-half the full regular rate (pre-deductions) must be
paid for all statutory OT hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The purpose and effect of the deductions are not to
evade the OT requirements or other laws: Deductions made only in OT workweeks,
or increases in prices charged during OT workweeks compared to non-OT
workweeks, will be considered manipulations to evade statutory OT requirements
which are prohibited. Deductions that violate other applicable laws are
prohibited in an OT workweek. (See Regs 531.37(a) and 778.315.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j09   Payments for activities not normally hours worked.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Payments
for those voluntary clothes-changing and wash-up periods and bona fide lunch
periods which need not be regarded as hours worked, but which take place at the
establishment or work site either during or at the beginning or end of the
workday, shall be treated as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Where the activity has been paid for and the time has
been included in computing the hours worked, in the absence of evidence of an
attempt to evade the OT requirements, the time shall be accepted as hours worked
for the purpose of determining whether the OT provisions have been met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Sec 778.320(b) of IB 778 indicates that the conversion
of certain activities into hours worked by virtue of the employer’s payment for
such time depends on “whether or not it appears from all the pertinent facts
that the parties have agreed to treat such time as hours worked”. It is
explained in this section of the IB that the parties may agree to exclude from
hours worked those activities, such as eating meals between working hours,
which would not be hours worked even if they were paid for pursuant to a
contract, custom, or practice. Sec 778.320(b) states further that where “the
parties have agreed to exclude such activities from hours worked, payments for
such time will be regarded as qualifying for exclusion from the regular rate
under the provisions of section 7(e)(2)” of the FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j10   Delayed payment of overtime compensation.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In
the ordinary case, the FLSA and the PCA require the payment of both MW and OT
compensation earned in a given workweek at the regular payday for that workweek
or, where the pay period covers more than a single week, at the regular payday
for the pay period in which the particular workweek ends. However, if the
correct OT compensation cannot be determined until sometime after the regular
pay period, the requirements of the FLSA or the PCA will be satisfied if the
employee is paid the excess OT compensation as soon after the regular payday as
is practicable, but not later than the next payday after the computation can be
made. Where bonuses are paid, any extra OT pay due upon the increase in the
regular rate resulting from the bonus payment is due only at the time the bonus
itself is paid, not earlier.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j11   Semimonthly or monthly payments which include overtime.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
the wages due an employee are properly computed on a workweek basis, an
employer may pay the determinable portion of such wages in semimonthly or
monthly installments without destroying time validity of the regular rate of
pay or violating the provisions of the FLSA or PCA. For example, where an
employee is hired to work a regularly scheduled workweek of 44 hours at a rate
of $2.00 per hour with time and one-half that rate ($3.00) for hours in excess
of 40 in the workweek, which equals $92.00, it is permissible for the employer
to make semimonthly wage installments to him of $ 199.33 ($92.00 x 52 w in a
year divided by 24 semimonthly payments in a year), provided additional
compensation at time and one-half pay day for any workweek in which hours in
excess of 44 are worked, or the proper reduction in pay is made where other
than excused absences occur. Likewise, payment on this basis will not of itself
destroy an otherwise valid Sec. 7(f) plan.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j12   Concurrently working for more than one employer.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
two or more employers arrange to, and do, jointly employ an employee, the total
hours worked by the employee for the employers shall be added together to
determine the total number of hours worked in the workweek by the employee for
which straight time and OT should be paid.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j13   Change of workweek.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
A change of the workweek from one
period of seven consecutive days to another period of seven consecutive days
necessarily creates an overlap between the last workweek in the old schedule
and the first workweek in the new; that is, certain hours fall within both
workweeks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
If the hours which fall within
both workweeks are hours in which the employee does no work, his statutory
compensation for each workweek is, of course, determined as it would be if no
over existed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
If, on the other hand, some of the
employee’s work time falls within hours which are included in both workweeks,
the employee’s straight-time and OT compensation shall be computed by counting
such work time as hours worked in whichever of the two workweeks its inclusion
will yield the higher total compensation for both workweeks. After thus
determining the workweek to which the overlapping work time shall be allocated,
the remaining workweek shall be treated as one in which the only compensable
worktime is that falling exclusively within that workweek and outside the
portion which overlaps the other workweek. Subject to this modification, the
compensation due an employee for straight-time and for overtime on a daily or
weekly basis shall be computed and paid for each workweek as in workweeks when
no overlap occurs.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j14f Stint or task basis of payment in other industries.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The stint or task basis of payment
is also used to some extent in industries other than the brick industry. In the
meat packing industry, the hours paid for at the agreed rate for the completion
of a pre-determined amount of work are called “cow hours” or “kill time”. In
the smelters of the metal refining industry the predetermined day’s work is
called the “heat”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Where investigations in other
industries disclose that the stint or task basis of payment has been used to
compensate employees for overtime and where that method would appear to fall
within the principles outlined above, enforcement action shall not be taken
until an opinion is secured as to the validity of the method of payment. All of
the facts concerning the stint or task basis of payment shall be obtained and
the investigation referred to the Regional Office for discussion with, or
referral to, the Regional Attorney. The facts shall include information as to:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  whether the hours necessary to complete the
predetermined amount of work, after which extra compensation of at least 50
percent is paid, are the employees’ normal working hours;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  whether the employees are presently working more
hours;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  how long they have been regularly working excess
hours;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  whether the excess hours of work are due to seasonal
factors or emergency or transitory conditions which are not expected to be
permanent;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  if the employees have always regularly worked excess
hours, whether the overtime standard adopted and applied was with the bona fide
intention of establishing it as the normal working period to which the regular
working hours will be conformed as soon as the necessary adjustments can
practicably be made;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  whether the hours of work are different for different
groups of employees or different departments where the same overtime standard
is used;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  whether there is any information available as to hours
of work and overtime standards used in other establishments in the same
industry and area; and,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)  the extent of compliance with other requirements of
Section 7(g)(1) or (2), as explained in IB778.415-.423 such as payment of extra
overtime compensation on other forms of additional pay required to be included
in computing the regular rate, or payment of extra compensation of at least 50
percent for at least the number of hours actually worked in excess of the
applicable statutory maximum workweek.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j15   Wage pool arrangement.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
A bona fide wage pool arrangement
will be in compliance with FLSA Section 7 and the average rate for the group
will be a proper regular rate of pay if</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  a group of employees work interchangeably at various
occupations carrying different rates;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  the employees in the group are not paid individually
the rates assigned to each occupation;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  all straight time earnings of the group, computed at
the assigned rates are totaled and divided by the total straight-time hours
worked by the group;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  all overtime earnings, at one and one-half times the
assigned rates, are separately totaled and divided by the total overtime hours
worked by the group;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  the daily or weekly earnings of each employee for each
day of workweek are then computed by multiplying the average straight time rate
for the group by the employee’s straight time hours, and the average overtime
rate for the group by the number of hours the employee worked in excess of 8 a
day or the applicable statutory maximum workweek.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j16d Comparison of the time off and prepayment plans.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
In two respects a prepayment plan,
if it may be properly applied to salaried employees, is not subject to the same
restrictions as a time off plan. It is not confined, in its operations, to the
pay period. Credits to the employer, that is, amounts paid by him/her in excess
of the amounts earned by the employee or to which the employee is entitled, may
be carried over beyond the pay period until they are consumed by the OT work of
the employee. Secondly a prepayment plan may be applied to employees who are
paid weekly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Where applicable, a time off and
prepayment plan may be applied together</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
These two plans are rarely used.
When an Inv finds one in operation, he should communicate with his/her DD and
obtain instructions as to how he/she should proceed.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j17   Domestic service employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Effective 5/1/74, Sec 7(1)
provides that:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No
employer shall employ any employee in domestic service in one or more
households for a workweek longer than 40 hours unless such employee receives
compensation for such employment in accordance with subsection (a).”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The language of Sec 7(1) places
the OT penalty on employment by an “employer”. The OT provisions become
applicable when a single employer employs a domestic worker for more than 40
hours in any w/w in that employer’s service. Such employer shall be required to
pay that employee in accordance with the OT provisions of Sec 7(a), unless the
exemptions in Sec 13(a)(15) or Sec 13(b)(21) are applicable.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32j18   Tipped employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Tip credit</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Section
3(m) of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. 203(m), permits an employer meeting all of the
requirements of that section to take a &quot;tip credit&quot; as part of the
Sec. 6(a)(1) wage it is required to pay its tipped employees and further
provides that the “wage” of a tipped employee equals the sum of the direct or
cash wage paid by the employer (which cannot be less than $2.13 per hour) and
the additional amount the employer is using as a credit against tips received,
which cannot exceed the difference between the minimum wage specified in Sec.
6(a)(1) of the FLSA and the direct or cash wage paid.  See FOH 30d for a full
discussion of the tip credit.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Tip credit in overtime hours</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>An
employer may not take a higher tip credit during overtime hours than during
non-overtime hours.  Under Sec. 3(m), the amount of the tip credit is the
difference between the direct wage paid (which cannot be less than $2.13 per
hour) and the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.  This formula determines the maximum
amount of an employee’s tips that can be considered wages per hour during the
workweek.  The amount of the tip credit may not increase during the workweek,
even during overtime hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Overtime Obligation  </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>FLSA
overtime principles apply to tipped employees in the same manner as they apply
to all covered, non-exempt employees.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Determining the Regular Rate
for Tipped Employees  </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
regular rate for a tipped employee is determined by dividing the total
remuneration in any workweek, minus statutory exclusions, by the total hours
worked. 29 CFR 531.60.  The regular rate can never be less than the highest
applicable minimum wage.  29 CFR 778.5.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An
employer may claim a tip credit and also provide board, lodging, or other
facilities. See 29 CFR part 531; FOH30c.  The tip credit equals the difference
between the minimum wage and the direct wage paid, which may be comprised of
cash, board, lodging, and/or facilities, and must be at least $2.13 per hour. 
FOH30d06(b).  In determining the regular rate for a tipped employee, all
components of the employee’s wages must be considered (cash, board, lodging,
facilities, tip credit). Tips in excess of the FLSA tip credit are not
considered wages under Sec. 3(m) and are not considered in determining the
regular rate.  29 CFR 531.60.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In
determining the regular rate for a tipped employee, both the direct wage and
the tip credit must be included.  For example, if the employee is paid a direct
wage of $2.13 and the employer claims a tip credit of $5.12, the regular rate
will be $7.25 and the overtime rate will be $10.88 ($7.25 x 1.5).  The direct
wage payment in overtime hours would be $5.76 ($10.88 - $5.12); the overtime
direct wage payment is not 1.5 x the non-overtime direct wage payment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  An employee works 50 hours in a tipped occupation. 
The employer pays a cash wage of $2.13 per hour and claims a tip credit of
$5.12.  The employer complies with the requirements in 29 CFR 531.59(b) to
inform its employees about the tip credit and the employee receives at least
$5.12 per hour in tips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$7.25
regular rate ($2.13 cash wage + $5.12 tip credit)</p>
<p>50 x
7.25 = 362.50 (straight time)</p>
<p>10 x
.5 x 7.25 = 36.25 (overtime premium)</p>
<p>$398.75
total wages due</p>
<p>50 x
5.12 = 256 tip credit</p>
<p>398.75
– 256 = 142.75 direct wage</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  An employee works 45 hours in a tipped occupation. 
The employer pays a cash wage of $3.00 per hour and claims a tip credit of
$4.25.  The employer complies with the requirements in 29 CFR 531.59(b) to
inform its employees about the tip credit and the employee receives at least
$4.25 per hour in tips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$7.25
regular rate ($3.00 cash wage + $4.25 tip credit)</p>
<p>45 x
7.25 = 326.25 (straight time)</p>
<p>5 x
.5 x 7.25 = 18.13 (overtime premium)</p>
<p>$
344.38 total wages due</p>
<p>45 x
4.25 = 191.25 tip credit</p>
<p>344.38
– 191.25 = $153.13 direct or cash wage</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
<b>Deductions </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When
an employer claims a tip credit, the tipped employee is considered to have been
paid only the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage for all non-overtime hours worked in a
tipped occupation.  See FOH 30d06.  An employer that claims a tip credit
therefore may not make deductions in a workweek of 40 hours or less for
non-3(m) costs such as shortages, breakage, cost of uniforms, etc., because any
such deduction would reduce the tipped employee’s wages below the minimum
wage.  Updating Regulations Issued Under the Fair Labor Standards Act; Final
Rule, 76 FR 18839, April 5, 2011; 29 CFR 531.36.  Because non-3(m) deductions
cannot be made in a workweek of 40 hours or less when the tip credit is
claimed, employers are also prohibited from taking such deductions in overtime
weeks, even when the regular rate is higher than the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage
(for example, when a higher state minimum wage is the regular rate).  See 29
CFR 531.37.  When an employer claims a tip credit, deductions for non-3(m)
items, therefore, cannot be valid in an overtime workweek, because deductions
not permitted in non-overtime workweeks are also prohibited in overtime
workweeks.  See 32j08(b).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An
employer may only make non-3(m) deductions from the wages of a tipped employee
when no tip credit is claimed and the direct or cash wage paid is greater than
the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)  
<b>Regular Rate in Excess of FLSA
MW</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When
Federal, state or local laws require an employer to pay a higher minimum wage
than required by FLSA, or if the wage set through established practice,
agreement, or understanding is greater than the  Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage, FLSA
overtime provisions require that the employee receive the regular rate for all
hours worked before overtime is calculated.  Where an employer claims a tip
credit under Sec. 3(m), straight time wages paid to the employee are capped at
the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage.  See FOH30d00. Consequently, where the regular
rate exceeds the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage, before additional half time for
overtime is computed, the rate paid to the tipped employee in overtime weeks
must be raised to the regular rate.  The employer therefore owes the difference
between the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage and the regular rate in cash for all
hours worked as a tipped employee.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)  
Questions regarding the proper
calculation of overtime pay often arise in situations where state or local laws
require an employer to pay a higher minimum wage than required by the FLSA and
permit the employer to claim a higher tip credit than permitted under the
FLSA.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For
example, assume the state minimum wage is $7.50 and that the state law requires
a cash wage of $2.13 per hour and allows the employer to take a tip credit of
$5.37 per hour.  Assuming all hours worked during the week were at the state
minimum wage rate, the employee’s regular rate is the state minimum wage rate
($7.50) but the employer is limited to a tip credit of $5.12 under the FLSA
($7.25 – $2.13). See 29 CFR 778.5.  The employer must make up the difference
between the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage and the regular rate in cash before
calculating the additional half time due.  See FOH32j02.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)  <b>Examples of how to compute overtime for tipped
employees</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For
purposes of these examples, assume the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum wage rate is $7.25
per hour, that the employee worked 45 hours in the workweek, and that all hours
worked were in a tipped occupation.  Assume the employee meets the Sec. 3(t)
definition of a tipped employee and that the employer complied with the
requirements in 29 CFR 531.59(b) to inform employees about the tip credit and
that the payroll records are accurate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The state minimum wage is $7.40 per hour, the employer
pays a cash wage of $2.89 as required under state law and claims a tip credit
of $4.51.  The employee’s regular rate is $7.40 per hour.  </p>

<b>Dual Occupations </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
an employee works in both a tipped occupation and a non-tipped occupation in
the same workweek, a weighted average will generally be used to calculate the
regular rate (blended rate).  29 C.F.R. § 778.115.  Under a blended rate, the
earnings from the hourly rates for both occupations are added together and the
sum is divided by the total number of hours worked at both jobs.  The
employee’s earnings are the total of all straight time pay plus overtime for
hours worked in excess of 40 based on one-half times the blended rate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>See
29 CFR 778.419 and FOH 32h00 for guidance on overtime pay based on the rate in
effect</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An
employee works as a server for 32 hours and as a cook for 22 hours for the same
employer in the same workweek.  The employer pays $9.75 per hour for hours
worked as a cook, which is a non-tipped occupation.  The employer paid a direct
wage of $2.13 and claimed a tip credit of $5.12 for the hours worked as a
server; the employer complied with the tip credit notice provision and kept
appropriate records.  </p>

<h3>32k01  Exchanging shifts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If
OT results from an employee exchanging shifts with another employee, he/she
must be paid time and one-half his/her basic rate for the OT hours, even though
the exchange of shifts was made for the employees’ mutual convenience.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>32k02  Making up lost time.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Where
an employee works more than eight hours a day in order to make up time lost for
any reason other than tardiness, such as time lost because of a holiday, he/she
must be paid time and one-half his/her basic rate, even though the employee
requested the arrangement or acquiesced in it.</p>

<h3>32L00  Public agency employment may qualify under Sec 7(b).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Secs
7(b)(1) and 7(b)(2) provide partial OT exemptions for employees employed “. . .
in pursuance of an agreement made as a result of collective bargaining by
representatives of employees certified as bona fide by the National Labor
Relations Board . . .” under the stated conditions . The NLRB concludes it has
authority to process petitions from labor organizations of government employees
seeking certification as “bona fide” for purposes of Secs 7(b)(1) and 7(b)(2)
of the FLSA. Consequently, if the tests for exemption under Sec 7(b)(1) and
7(b)(2) are met and the union receives such certification by the NLRB, the
government employees covered under the “agreement” may qualify for such
exemption.</p>

<h3>33a00.   Statutory provisions, regulations, and interpretative
materials.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
FLSA §§ 3(l), 12, 13(c) and 13(d),
and 29 CFR part 570, are the basic source materials that govern the application
of the child labor (CL) provisions of the FLSA.  This chapter of the FOH
supplements these documents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>FLSA § 3(l) </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  FLSA § 3(l) defines “oppressive child labor” as a
condition of employment under which </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Any employee under the age of
sixteen years is employed by an employer in any occupation, or </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Where any employee between the
ages of sixteen and eighteen years of age is employed by an employer in any
occupation which the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) shall find and by order
declare to be particularly hazardous for the employment of children between
such ages or detrimental to their health or well-being.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
Secretary has declared 17 Hazardous Occupations Orders (HOs) for
nonagricultural employment which are contained in subpart E of 29 CFR part 570,
§§ 570.50 through 570.68. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  FLSA § 3(l) gives the Secretary authority to issue
regulations governing the   employment of 14- and 15-year-old persons in
non-hazardous occupations other than  mining or manufacturing.  CL Regulation
No. 3 (subpart C of 29 CFR part 570), sets  forth the conditions of
employment for 14- and 15-year-old youths.  This employment is confined to
certain periods and conditions that do not interfere with    their schooling or
adversely affect their health and well-being.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
FLSA § 12 generally prohibits the
shipment in commerce of any goods produced in an establishment in or about
which within thirty days prior to the removal of such goods any oppressive CL
was employed; prohibits the employment of oppressive CL in any enterprise
engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce; and authorizes
the Secretary to administer the provisions of the FLSA relating to oppressive
CL.  The two types of coverage established by FLSA §§ 12(a) and 12(c) are
discussed in detail in FOH 33a01 and 33a02 below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
FLSA § 13(c), among other things,
contains the statutory exemptions pertaining to CL.  This section addresses the
employment of youth: in agriculture (§§ 13(c)(1), (2), and (4)); as actors or
performers in motion pictures or theatrical productions, or in radio or
television productions (§ 13(c)(3)); as loaders of compacting and/or baling
equipment (§ 13(c)(5)); as drivers of automobiles and trucks (§ 13(c)(6)); and
as employees of facilities where machinery is used to process wood products (§
13(c)(7)). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
FLSA § 13(d) contains exemptions
from FLSA §§ 6, 7, and 12 for the employment of workers engaged in the delivery
of newspapers to the consumer, and to any homeworker engaged in the making of
wreaths composed principally of natural holly, pine, cedar, or other evergreens
(including the harvesting of the evergreens or other forest products used in
making such wreaths).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)  
The employment of youths under 14
years of age is limited to work that is not subject to the FLSA or is exempt
from its provisions.  </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33a01.   CL Coverage—§ 12(c).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Section 12(c) provides that “[n]o
employer shall employ any oppressive child labor in commerce or in the
production of goods for commerce or in any enterprise engaged in commerce or in
the production of goods for commerce.”  29 CFR 570.112 and 570.113 discuss the
provisions related to coverage under § 12(c).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Coverage for the prohibition of
the employment of oppressive CL under § 12(c) is the same as under §§ 6 and
7—individual coverage or enterprise coverage (see FOH Chapters 10,
11, and 12). </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33a02.   CL Coverage—§ 12(a).</h3>
<p>                  </p>
<p>(a)  
Section 12(a) of the FLSA states
that “[n]o producer, manufacturer, or dealer shall ship or deliver for shipment
in commerce any goods produced in an establishment in the United States in or
about which within thirty days prior to the removal of such goods therefrom any
oppressive child labor has been employed.”  Such “goods” are referred to as
“hot goods” (see FOH 33a02(c)(1)b for an example of “hot goods”). 
29 CFR 570.104 through 570.111 contain the provisions related to
coverage under § 12(a).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The term goods is defined in § 3(i) of
the FLSA as “goods [], wares, products, commodities, merchandise, or articles
or subjects of commerce of any character, or any part or ingredient thereof . .
.”  This definition expressly excludes goods after their delivery into the
actual physical possession of an ultimate consumer other than a producer,
manufacturer, or processor.  The term includes such items as foodstuffs,
clothing, machinery, printed materials, blueprints, and also includes
intangibles (see 29 CFR 570.107).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The term commerce is defined in FLSA §
3(b) as meaning “trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or
communication among the several States or between any State and any place
outside thereof.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The term oppressive child labor is defined in FLSA §
3(l).  For purposes of § 12(a), oppressive child labor can and does occur in
establishments whose minor employees are not covered on an individual or
enterprise basis under FLSA § 12(c) because the definition of oppressive child
labor does not require that the minor employees be covered under the FLSA.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Goods produced in an establishment
in or about which oppressive CL has been employed are barred as “hot goods” and
are prohibited from being shipped or delivered for shipment in commerce under §
12(a) if:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Such goods were removed from the establishment while
any oppressive CL was still being employed in or about it, or </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Such goods were removed from the establishment within
30 days after the employment of oppressive CL had ceased in or about the
establishment.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The prohibitions of § 12(a) apply
only to the shipment of goods in commerce that were actually “produced” in and
removed from an establishment in or about which oppressive CL was employed.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  These hot goods provisions are applicable even though
the under-age employee does not himself or herself engage in the production of
the goods, as long as somewhere in the establishment in or about which he or
she is employed goods are “produced” which are subsequently shipped or
delivered for shipment in commerce.  It also does not matter if the youth’s
employment that constitutes the oppressive child labor is covered under FLSA §
12(c).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
For example, § 12(a) would apply
where 14- or 15- year-old minors are employed to load milk on trucks at a dairy
establishment and deliver it to households if the dairy establishment produces
some of its goods for shipment in commerce.  This employment constitutes
oppressive child labor because such work is prohibited by § 570.33(k) and (n).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The hot goods provisions of §
12(a) would also apply in the following example.  A 15-year-old minor works as
a cashier in a small retail bakery that makes cakes and pies, some of which are
shipped, or delivered for shipment, in commerce.  Assume the minor does not
handle checks or credit card transactions.  Because the ADV of the enterprise
is under $500,000, the minor would not be covered on an “enterprise basis”
under § 12(c).  Because the minor is not “employed in commerce” or in the
“production of goods for commerce,” he or she is not covered on an individual
basis.  But if this minor’s employment was in violation of the child labor
standards—such as working until 10:00 p.m. in violation of the CL Reg 3 hours
standards—oppressive child labor would have occurred.  The products produced by
the baker during the period of the oppressive CL, and thirty days thereafter,
would be “hot goods” under § 12(a). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
As explained in section (c)(4),
below, section 12(a) coverage also applies when a minor is employed by an
employer other than the establishment owner or operator if that minor performs
some work in or about the producing establishment.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Section 12(a) only applies to “hot goods” and bars a
producer, manufacturer, or dealer from shipping or delivering “hot goods” in
commerce.  To establish “hot goods” for purposes of § 12(a), WH does not have
to show that a minor was engaged in the production of goods.  WH must only
demonstrate that a minor was illegally employed in or about the establishment
where the goods were produced within 30 days prior to the removal of the goods
from the establishment.  If 30 days pass after the CL violation, and no further
violations have occurred, the “hot goods” will have “cooled,” and shipment from
the establishment is permitted.  If the goods are removed before 30 days have
passed, the goods are permanently “hot”.  Finally, § 12(a) does not bar
shipment or sale of goods where the initial shipment does not occur until the
goods have “cooled”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  A producer, manufacturer, or dealer may “ship” goods
in commerce either by moving them itself in interstate or foreign commerce or
by causing them to move, such as by delivery to a carrier.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
A baker “ships” its bread in
commerce whether it carries it in its own truck across state lines or sends it
by contract or common carrier to its customers in other states. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
A manufacturer delivers its goods
for shipment in commerce when it transports its goods in state to a distributor
who, as the manufacturer is well aware, will ship the goods into another
state.  For example, a paper box manufacturer who ships a carton of boxes to a
fresh fruit or vegetable packing shed within the same state, with knowledge or
reason to believe that the boxes will there be filled with fruits or vegetables
and shipped outside the state, has delivered the boxes for shipment in
commerce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
However, the word “ship” must be
applied in its ordinary meaning.  It does not apply to the transmission of
telegraphic messages, for example (see 29 CFR 570.106(a)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Consideration must be given to both whether a minor is
employed “in” or employed “about” the establishment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
A minor who performs occupational
duties on the premises of the producing establishment is employed “in” that
establishment.  A minor is also employed “in” an establishment where the minor
performs most duties off the premises but is regularly required to perform
certain occupational duties in the establishment, such as loading or unloading
a truck.  This is true even though the minor is employed by someone other than
the owner or operator of the particular establishment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
However, a minor is not employed
“in” an establishment other than his or her employer's merely because such
establishment is visited by the minor for brief periods of time and for the
sole purpose of picking up or delivering a message or other small article.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
If the minor cannot be considered
as employed “in” the establishment, he or she may, nevertheless, be employed
“about” it.  However, the minor must perform occupational duties sufficiently
close in proximity to the actual place of production to fall within the
commonly understood meaning of the term “about,” and the minor’s occupation
must be directly related to the activities carried on in the producing,
manufacturing or dealing establishment.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
For example, a driver's helper
employed to assist in the distribution of the products of a bottling company
who regularly boards the delivery truck immediately outside the premises of the
bottling plant is considered employed “in or about” such establishment, without
regard to whether he ever enters the plant itself. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
On the other hand, employees
working entirely within one establishment are not considered to be employed “in
or about” a wholly different establishment occupying separate premises and
operated by another employer. This would be true even though the two
establishments are contiguous (see 29 CFR 570.110(b)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Section 12(a) of the FLSA establishes a “good faith”
defense from the prohibition on shipping hot goods for a purchaser of these
goods who has acquired these goods for value, in good faith, without notice
that the goods were produced in violation of the FLSA, and in reliance on
written assurance from the producer that the goods were produced in compliance
with the FLSA.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
For example a wholesaler who
purchases goods in “good faith” from a producer, manufacturer, or dealer of
such goods, who in turn sells these goods in his retail establishment, would
have a “good faith” defense from the § 12(a) prohibitions.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
However, a person or firm that
owns the goods throughout the production process, even though some or all of
the production work is done by independent contractors, or subcontractors or
other producers of goods, cannot be a “purchaser in good faith” who is removed
from the “hot goods” provisions of § 12(a).  For example, a garment
manufacturer could not claim that it was a “purchaser in good faith”, if it
owns the product throughout the manufacturing process, even though the cutting,
sewing, and embroidery work was all performed by independent contractors,
contractors, and subcontractors.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33a03.   Distinction between §§ 12(a) and 12(c) coverage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Coverage under § 12(c) is
dependent upon a minor being employed in commerce or in the production of goods
for commerce, or in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of
goods for commerce.  Section 12(c) coverage is based upon either the minor’s
performance of individually covered activities or employment in a covered
enterprise.  If such a minor is employed under these circumstances a violation
of § 12(c) would occur regardless of where he or she may be employed or what
his employer may do and regardless of whether there is a “removal” of goods or
a shipment or delivery for shipment in commerce.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Coverage under § 12(a) on the
other hand, often said to apply on an “establishment” basis, is dependent upon
the performance of duties in or about an establishment producing goods for commerce
rather than upon the nature of the work performed by the minor employee or by
the nature of the enterprise.  Section 12(a) coverage does not require that the
minor whose employment constitutes oppressive child labor be covered on an
enterprise or individual basis.  The provisions of § 12(a) would still apply in
a situation in which an under-age employee does not engage in the production of
goods themselves if somewhere in the establishment in or about which they are
employed goods are “produced” which are subsequently shipped or delivered for
shipment in commerce.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>(c)   </b>Section 12(a) does not directly exclude the employment
of oppressive CL.  Instead, it prohibits the shipment or delivery for shipment
in interstate or foreign commerce of goods produced in an establishment where
oppressive CL has been employed within thirty days before removal of the
goods.  Section 12(c), on the other hand, is a direct prohibition against the
employment of oppressive CL in commerce, or in the production of goods for commerce.   
</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>33a04  . Domestic service employees—CL.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
CL provisions of FLSA § 12, apply to domestic service employees only when such
employees are covered on an “individual” or “enterprise” basis, or if they are
employed in or about a home where homeworkers produce goods for commerce. 
Thus, unless such coverage exists, the prohibitions of § 12 do not apply. 
However, the MW and OT provisions of FLSA §§ 6(b) and 7(a)(1) are applicable,
pursuant to §§ 6(f) and 7(l) if the tests are met—unless such employment is
exempt under § 13(a)(15) or § 13(b)(21).  See 29 CFR 552.108.</p>

<h3>33b00  . General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Although 16 is the basic minimum
age for employment in nonagricultural occupations, § 3(l) of the FLSA gives the
Secretary authority to issue regulations governing the conditions under which
youth 14 and 15 years of age may be employed.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may not
be employed in any job covered by the Act unless the Secretary has provided, by
regulation or order, that the employment of such youth is confined to periods
which will not interfere with their schooling and to conditions which will not
interfere with their health and well-being.  Employment that is not
specifically permitted is prohibited (see § 570.32).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The Secretary’s declaration of
what legal employment 14- and 15-year-olds may hold, and for what periods, is
contained in Child Labor Regulation Number 3 (CL Reg 3), subpart C of
29 CFR part 570.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
The FLSA generally prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in mining and manufacturing occupations, and
any Hazardous Occupations Order (HO) established by the Secretary of Labor. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33b01  . CL Reg 3 hours standards.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR 570.35(a) sets forth the conditions of employment in nonagricultural
occupations for 14- and 15-year-old minors, confining such employment to
periods and conditions that do not interfere with their schooling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
CL Reg 3 limits the employment of
14- and 15-year-olds to periods that are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Outside of school hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Not before 7:00 a.m.; and not after 7:00 p.m. (except
such youth may work until 9:00 p.m. between June 1 and Labor Day).  This means
that such minors may only work until 7:00 p.m. from the day after Labor Day
through May 31st.  These “end of day” hours standards are tied to
the calendar year, not the school year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  No more than 3 hours on a school day, including
Fridays, and no more than 18 hours in a week in which school is “in session.”. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  No more than 8 hours on a nonschool day, and no more
than 40 hours in a week when school is not “in session.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>School hours</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  School hours are determined by the local public school
in the area where the minor is residing while employed—this is true even if the
minor does not attend the public school (i.e., attends a private school, a
religious school, or is home schooled).  School hours refers to the hours
established by the school district during the regularly scheduled school year
and not the hours the individual child is required to attend (see
§ 570.35(b))</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Special provisions apply to students participating in
a state sponsored Work Experience and Career Exploration Program authorized by
the Department of Labor in accordance with 29 CFR 570.36 or in school
sponsored Work-Study Program in accordance with 29 CFR 570.37 (see
FOH 33b02(c) and 33b02(d) for more information about these programs).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Outside school hours and school
hours</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Outside school hours means such periods as before and
after school hours, holidays, summer vacations, weekends, and any other day or
part of a day when the local public school district where the minor resides
while employed is not in session.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Because school hours are determined by the hours
established by the local public school district during the regularly scheduled
school year, summer school sessions are also considered to be “outside school
hours” for the purpose of applying the hours limitations of CL Reg 3. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  In some instances a school may employ a student 14 or
15 years of age to work (for example, in the cafeteria) during the noon hour or
during a period when the student has no class.  For purposes of CL Reg 3 (§
570.35(a)(1)), such work will be considered as “outside school hours” (see
also FOH Chapter 10). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  As discussed in FOH 33b02(b), § 570.35(c) creates
exceptions from certain CL Reg 3 hours limitations for certain 14- and
15-year-old minors.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  At one time, WH permitted enrollees in the “in school”
program of the Neighborhood Youth Corps (NYC) to work “during school hours” as
this term is used in CL Reg 3 under certain specified conditions.  Such youth
were limited to working no more than 8 hours per week.  The Employment and
Training Administration (ETA) has advised WH that the NYC ended in the early
1970s and all successor programs have required compliance with the federal
child labor provisions, including the hours standards of CL Reg 3. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Week defined</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Week, as used in 29 CFR 570.35(a)(2) and (3), means a
regularly recurring period of 168 hours—seven consecutive 24-hour periods—that
is identical to the workweek that the employer establishes under 29 CFR
778.105.  Prior to July 19, 2010, the effective date of the 2010 Final Rule
published on May 20, 2010, the term week was defined as a standard calendar
week that commences at 12:01 a.m. Sunday and ends at midnight Saturday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>(2)  </b>Week when school is in session, as used in 29 CFR 570.35(a)(3), means
any week the local public school district where the minor resides while
employed is in session and students are required to attend for at least one day
or partial day.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>33b02  . Partial exemptions impacting the CL Reg 3 hours
standards.</h3>
<p>       </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Professional sports attendants</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR 570.35(c)(2) exempts from the hours standards of CL Reg 3 minors 14 and 15
years of age who are employed to perform sports-attending services at
professional sporting events provided they are employed outside of school hours
and perform only those sports-attending duties listed in that section.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Duties which are permitted include pre- and post-game
or practice setup of balls, items and equipment; supplying and retrieving
balls, items, and equipment during a sporting event; clearing the field or
court of debris, moisture, etc. during play; providing ice, drinks, towels,
etc., to players during play; running errands for trainers, managers, coaches,
and players before, during, and after a sporting event; and returning and/or
storing balls, items and equipment to club houses or locker rooms after
sporting events.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Duties which are not permitted include:  grounds or
field maintenance such as grass mowing, spreading or rolling tarpaulins used to
cover playing areas, etc.; cleaning and repairing equipment; cleaning locker
rooms, showers, lavatories, rest rooms, team vehicles, club houses, dugouts, or
similar facilities; loading and unloading balls, items, and equipment from team
vehicles before and after a sporting event; doing laundry; working in
concession stands or other selling and promotional activities; and performing
the duties of an umpire, referee, or other sports official.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>High school graduates, children
excused from school on religious grounds, and expelled students</b></p>
<p>(1)  29 CFR 570.35(c)(1) provides exemptions from the CL
Reg 3 hours standards limitations contained in § 570.35(a)(1), (3), and
(5) for those 14- and 15-year-olds listed below who, for a variety of reasons,
do not or cannot attend school.  These exemptions, which stem from long
standing WH enforcement positions, were placed in the regulations by the Final
Rule published on May 20, 2010 (see 75 FR 28423).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Minors who have graduated from
high school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Minors who have been excused from
compulsory school attendance by the state or other jurisdiction once they have
completed the eighth grade if compliance is achieved with all the requirements
of the state school attendance law.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Minors who are subject to an order
of a state or federal court prohibiting them from attending school. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Minors who have been permanently
expelled from school (not a temporary suspension) and are not required by state
or local law or ordinance or court order to attend another school.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
Minors who have a child to support
and appropriate state officers, pursuant to state law, have waived school
attendance standards for the minors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The above minors, however, are subject to the
remaining conditions established by CL Reg 3, including the occupational
limitations and the provisions that permit them to work only between the hours
of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. (9:00 p.m. between June 1 and Labor Day).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  None of the exceptions listed in this section apply to
youth employed in agriculture.  The prohibition against the employment of youth
under 16 years of age in agriculture during the hours the local public school
is in session (except when employed by his or her parent on a farm owned or
operated by that parent) is statutory.  No exception from the prohibition
against employment during school hours, other than the parental exemption, is
provided by the FLSA for employment in agriculture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Work Experience and Career
Exploration Program (WECEP)</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  29 CFR 570.36 provides for certain variations from CL
Reg 3 for minors 14 and 15 years of age who are enrolled in and employed
pursuant to a state Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP) that
has been approved by WH.  In order to qualify for such variations, a state
educational agency (normally the state Department of Education) must file a
letter of application with the WH Administrator for approval of a program
plan.  Individual schools or school districts may not apply for or be granted a
WECEP by WH; approval is granted only to the state government.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
After WH has authorized the state
program, records of the names and addresses of each school enrolling students
in the WECEP, as well as the number of students enrolled, must be kept at the state
educational office and made available for review in that office by WH
representatives.  Additionally, the state educational agency or the local
school must keep on file a copy of the written training agreement that is
required for each student participating in the WECEP.  These records must be
kept for a period of three years.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
A list of states that have been
authorized to operate a WECEP can be found at www.dol.gov/whd.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Hours of work for WECEP students</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR 570.36(d) provides that students who are working under an approved WECEP
(including those employed in nonhazardous agricultural occupations) may be
employed for as many as 3 hours on any school day and 23 hours in any week
school is in session, any portion of which may be during school hours.  No
other changes, however, in the hours standards established by CL Reg 3 are
permitted and the standards will not be waived. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Occupations for WECEP students</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
29 CFR 570.36(c) prohibits WECEP
participants from being employed in the occupations of mining, manufacturing,
and those the Secretary of Labor has declared to be hazardous for the
employment of minors between the ages of 16 and 18 (the HOs).  This same
section provides for the employment of WECEP students in some occupations
otherwise prohibited under CL Reg 3 if a “variance” has been issued by the WH
Administrator.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Variances.  Before a student may
be employed in a prohibited occupation, the state educational agency must
submit a written request for a variance to the WH Administrator which outlines
all the steps the WECEP will take to ensure that the minor can safely perform
the work in question.  Information regarding the classroom and on-the-job
safety training, supervision, and personal protective equipment the youth will
receive must be detailed in the request. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
WECEP variance approvals are
specific to the school operating the WECEP and the employer that employs the
student.  Variance approvals run concurrently with the WECEP approval period of
the state program (up to two years).  Variances are valid only during the
months school is in session for the WECEP participant.  The variances are not
valid during summer vacation periods.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
The most common occupations
covered by WECEP variance requests that have been approved by the NO on an
individual basis, include: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A.   
Cooking over electric and gas
grills that does not involve cooking with an open flame and cooking with deep
fat fryers.  Prior to February 14, 2005 when new CL Reg 3 cooking rules became
effective, these requests allowed WECEP participants to perform cooking duties
that were not “in plain view” of the customer.  After February 14, 2005, WH
will consider issuing, on a case by case basis, variances that allow WECEP
students to operate deep fat fryers that are not equipped with devices that
automatically raise and lower the baskets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>B.   
Unloading trucks at retail and
food service establishments.  The variance approvals issued by the National
Office impose limitations on the amount of weight that may be lifted and the
amount of time that may be spent performing this task.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>C.   
Operating power-driven lawn mowers
(not riding mowers) and weed-eaters that use plastic “string” (not metal) to
cut vegetation.  Limitations on the amount of time WECEP participants may
perform these duties are detailed on the variance approvals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>D.   
Washing and cleaning of school
buses.  The variance approvals allow WECEP participants to work in garages and
“bus barns” but not to use power washing equipment, step ladders or ladders,
nor to work in “pits” when washing or cleaning buses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Wage rates for WECEP students</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WECEP
students generally must be paid the applicable MW rate (including a Youth
Minimum Wage where applicable).  Student-learner certificates cannot apply to
the employment of WECEP participants because, by definition, student-learners
must be at least 16 years of age (see 29 CFR 520.300).  Under certain
conditions, properly certified employers may pay WECEP participants less than
the applicable federal minimum wage as full-time students in accordance with
FLSA § 14(b) (see 29 CFR part 519).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Work-Study Program (WSP)</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  29 CFR 570.37 provides for certain variations from CL
Reg 3 for minors 14 and 15 years of age who are enrolled in and employed
pursuant to a Work-Study Program (WSP) that has been approved by WH.  In order
to qualify for such variations, the superintendent of the school attended by
the WSP candidate must first file with the WH Administrator a letter of
application for approval of the WSP.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The WSP is open only to youth enrolled in a college
preparatory curriculum.  A WSP student-participant must receive, every school
year he or she participates in the WSP, at least the minimum number of hours of
classroom instruction required to complete a fully-accredited college preparatory
curriculum (as determined by the State Educational Agency responsible for
establishing such standards).  Such classroom instruction shall include, every
year the youth participates in the WSP, training in workplace safety and state
and federal child labor provisions and rules.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Hours of work for WSP participants</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Employment of student-participants
in the WSP authorized by § 570.37 will be confined to not more than 18 hours in
a week when school is in session, a portion of which may be during school hours
in accordance with the following formula that is based upon a continuous
four-week-cycle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
In three of the four weeks, the
participant is permitted to work during school hours on only one day per week,
and for no more than for eight hours on that day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
During the remaining week of the
four-week cycle, the WSP student-participant is permitted to work during school
hours on no more than two days, and for no more than for eight hours on each of
those two days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The employment of WSP
student-participants must also comport with the time of day and number of hours
standards contained in §§ 570.35(a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(6).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The limitations on the number of
hours that participating students may be employed, as described in FOH
33b02(d)(3) above, constitute the absolute maximum number of hours that
participants may be employed.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
Participating schools and
employers may choose to adopt some other schedule of work hours that comports
with the established maxima—such as one four-hour day or one six-hour day each
workweek; or two eight-hour days each weekend; or three hours a day at the end
of each of three school days, as long as those hours comply with end-of-day
hours standards established by § 570.35(a)(6). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
They are, however, prohibited from
allowing the same participant to work during school hours on more than one
school day in any school week—except every fourth week in the four-week cycle
when such youth may work during school hours on no more than two school days in
that week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Occupations for WSP students  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
WSP participants must be employed
in accordance with the provisions of §§ 570.33 and .34.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The WSP has no provisions for
special occupational variances like those found in WECEP.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Wage rates for WSP students  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
WSP students generally must be
paid the applicable MW rate (including a Youth Minimum Wage where applicable). 
Student-learner certificates cannot apply to the employment of WSP participants
because, by definition, student-learners must be at least 16 years of age (see
29 CFR 520.300).  Under certain conditions, properly certified employers may
pay WSP participants less than the applicable federal MW as full-time students
in accordance with FLSA § 14(b) (see 29 CFR part 519). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Some WSP students may wish to
assign their wages to their school to defray the cost of the students'
educations.  WH will not take exception to such assignments as long as they
comport with the provisions of 29 CFR 531.40.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
Youth employed by a parent in a
business owned entirely by that parent are exempt from the CL Reg 3 hours
standards (see FOH 33e00).</p>

<h3>33c00.   General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The FLSA generally prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in mining and manufacturing occupations and
those occupations the Secretary of Labor has declared to be hazardous for the
employment of minors between 16 and 18 years of age or detrimental to their
health or well-being (the Hazardous Occupations Orders).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
In accordance with FLSA § 3(l),
nonexempt 14- and 15-year-olds may only be employed in those nonagricultural occupations
that the Secretary of Labor has determined do not interfere with their health
and well-being.  Occupations that are not specifically listed as permitted are
prohibited (see 29 CFR 570.32).  Such youth must also be employed in compliance
with the hours standards established by 29 CFR 570.35.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
29 CFR 570.34 lists those jobs
that the Secretary of Labor has determined do not interfere with the health and
welfare of 14- and 15-year-olds.  These are the “permitted occupations.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  29 CFR 570.33 details examples of occupations in which
14- and 15-year-olds may not be employed.  This list is not exhaustive, but
reflects some of the more common areas of violation.  This list is provided to
add clarity to the list of permitted occupations detailed in 29 CFR 570.34.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The order in which the CL Reg 3 Occupational Standards
are presented in this Chapter follow, as nearly as possible, the order in which
each standard is presented or touched upon in 29 CFR 570.33 and
570.34.  In general, FOH 33c discusses the list of prohibited occupations
(§ 570.33) and the permitted occupations (§ 570.34) are discussed in
FOH 33d.  Because §§ 570.33 and 570.34 tend to reinforce and provide
clarity to each other, considerable overlap between FOH 33c and 33d is to be
expected.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c01. Manufacturing, mining, and processing.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(a) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing, mining, or processing
occupations.  This section also prohibits the employment of such minors in
occupations which require the minors to perform any duties in work rooms or
work places where goods are manufactured, mined, or otherwise processed.  FLSA
§ 13(c)(7) provides an exemption from these requirements for certain youth who
may now be employed inside and outside of establishments where power-driven
machinery is used to process wood products (see FOH 33e06).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The definitions of manufacturing
and processing contained in (e) and (f) below are intended for use only in
connection with the CL provisions of the FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
It is necessary to distinguish
between manufacturing and processing only when the parental exemption is
involved (see FOH 33c00).  The parental exemption contained in the
FLSA does not permit the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing or
mining, but does allow the employment of this age group by a parent in
processing occupations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Although CL Reg 3 generally
prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in processing occupations (29
CFR 570.33(a)), youth may perform certain named processing occupations that are
detailed in § 570.34.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
<b>Manufacturing defined</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
term manufacturing means making anything from raw materials by
hand, or by machinery, or by art.  The process of manufacturing generally
involves the transformation of raw materials or semi-finished goods into new or
different articles.  The manufacturing process is not completed until the
article being manufactured has reached the form in which it will be available
to the ultimate consumer.  Any occupation involved in the manufacture of a
product from the assembling of the raw materials for manufacture to the
completion of the manufactured article is a part of the manufacturing process,
and, therefore, a manufacturing occupation.  All manufacturing is processing,
but not all processing is manufacturing.  The following are examples of
manufacturing within the meaning of CL Reg 3:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Trimming and examining of items when performed as a
part of a manufacturing process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Quality control and inspection of manufactured
products.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Cleaning of a printing press and proofreading in a
print shop.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Canning of fresh fruits or vegetables.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  The assembly of component parts into a finished
product away from the place where the component parts are manufactured is a
continuation of the manufacturing process, and is manufacturing.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Assembling of box shook or crates in which goods are
to be packed, including making of the lid or cover, is a change in the raw
material from which the box or crate is made and constitutes “manufacturing”
whether done by hand or machine.  However, assembling light-weight flat-folded
cartons either by stapling with a hand stapler machine or by pasting with tape
is not manufacturing.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  “Lidding”—the operation of fastening down the cover on
the filled container—is manufacturing when it is accomplished by use of a
power-driven machine.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)  Stitching of bags containing produce by means of
automatic electric sewing machines in fresh fruit and vegetable packing sheds
is manufacturing.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9)  The folding, pinning, and packaging for shipment of
newly manufactured apparel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(10)  “Carding.”  If the article is sold to the consumer as a
packaged or carded article, as is often the case with jewelry or buttons, the
packaging or carding of the article into the form in which it is offered to the
public is considered an integral part of the manufacturing of the article when
the work is performed in the manufacturing establishment.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>(f)  
<b>Processing defined</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The term processing ordinarily is understood to convey
the idea of an operation in the course of which goods undergo a change in form
or substance.  Examples of processing within the meaning of CL Reg 3 are:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Cleaning and filleting of fish,
freezing fresh shrimp, and the picking and packing of crabs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Slaughtering of livestock.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Dressing of poultry.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Cracking of nuts. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
Laundering, folding, hanging, and
pressing clean laundry; and the altering of clothes (whether performed in
commercial laundries or retail dry cleaners).  Except the washing and drying of
laundry performed in a coin-operated laundromat with home-type washer and dryer
machines is not considered processing if performed in a room separated from all
other processing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>f.     
Cutting or chipping of ice.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>g.    
Air drying or seasoning of
lumber.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>h.    
Repairing of motor vehicles,
changing tires and batteries.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>i.     
Placing of business records on
microfilm.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>j.     
Operations in connection with bulk
mailings including folding letters; addressing, stuffing, and sealing
envelopes; affixing postage; and bundling mailings.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>k.    
Painting of mine timbers; painting
and embossing objects.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>l.   
Developing of X-rays.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>m.  
Development of film into
photographs, including the use of automated systems in retail stores.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>n.    
The cutting of “mats” for
photographs, engravings, and artwork whether by hand, with a power-driven tool,
or a computerized automatic cutter.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The following activities would not be manufacturing or
processing activities:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The trimming and shearing of
ordinary household-size Christmas trees with hand tools (i.e., not power-driven
equipment) does not constitute a “processing occupation” as the term is used in
CL Reg 3.  Therefore, minors 14 and 15 years of age may be employed in this
occupation in accordance with the other provisions of CL Reg 3.  In some
instances, occupations in connection with Christmas trees may be within the
definition of agriculture contained in FLSA § 3(f) (see
FOH 20b06); in such cases §§ 13(c)(1) and (2) apply. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The transfer of propane from large
pressurized tanks to smaller tanks of a lower pressure without the use of power
driven equipment is not considered processing.  Therefore, minors 14 and 15 years
of age are not be prohibited from performing this activity because it is not
considered processing.  The basic form of the propane gas is not altered when
it is transferred from the large pressurized tank to the smaller pressurized
tank.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The packing of fresh fruits and
vegetables is not processing because the goods remain in their raw or natural
state.  Packing includes cleaning, washing, trimming, application of artificial
coloring, sorting, grading, tiering, wrapping, packaging and labeling packages
when these operations take place in conjunction with and as a part of the
packing of fresh fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
The tagging and pricing of
clothing for sale in a retail used-clothing shop, when some of the clothing is
not salable and is returned to a central location for processing into rags or
sold for scrap, is not processing.  The mere sorting of clothing does not
change or alter the clothing.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
The stuffing of newspapers—that is
the placing of one section of newspaper inside another—when performed outside
the work rooms in which printing, manufacturing, or processing takes place, is
a distribution function rather than a manufacturing or processing function. 
Therefore, 14- and 15-year-old minors may be employed in such newspaper
stuffing, provided all the terms and conditions of CL Reg 3 are met.  This
applies also to other occupations in the newspaper industry further removed
from the manufacturing of the newspaper, such as bundling, tying up,
addressing, and other mailing room occupations, and to employment in a
wholesale house engaged in the distribution of newspapers and magazines. 
Prohibited processing would occur if the minors placed newspapers in plastic
bags and then “heat sealed” the bags for security reasons or to protect the
contents from the elements.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c02. Occupations in work rooms.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Under CL Reg 3, 29 CFR 570.33(a),
minors may not generally be employed in a work room or work place where goods
are manufactured, mined or otherwise processed.  Goods, in this context, refers
to goods as defined in FLSA § 3(i).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The CL Reg 3 prohibition against
working in a work room or work place where goods are manufactured applies even
if the minor is engaged in work other than &quot;manufacturing, mining, or
processing.  The prohibition continues to apply even if the minor is working
during hours or days when the plant or establishment is closed and not in
operation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Director
of Industrial Division Children's Bureau McConnell's letter of September 1,
1942</b>.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Work rooms where goods are
manufactured or processed include work centers and manufacturing operations of
Community Rehabilitation Programs (CRPs) that employ workers with disabilities
at special minimum wages under certificates issued in accordance with FLSA §
14(c).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
There are some exceptions to this
general prohibition against working in work rooms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Children 14- and
15-years of age generally may not be employed in work rooms where manufacturing
or the processing of goods takes place, but they may be employed in
establishments at which such activities occur if they are working in a work
room or area separate from that in which the manufacturing or processing takes
place.  The work area must be separated from where the actual manufacturing or
process occurs by a wall or barrier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The type of barrier between the
manufacturing or processing activities and the minors’ work place depends in
large measure upon the nature of the manufacturing or processing operation. 
The barrier must be sufficient in height, strength, and density to guard the
youth from exposure to the hazards presented by the manufacturing or processing
process.  A strong barrier of wire might be all that is necessary to constitute
a separate work room.  Ordinarily, a barrier at least seven feet high is
adequate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
There may be openings in the
partition, but they may not be wider than those made for an ordinary door, and
such openings should have doors if possible.  If dust or fumes are present,
however, a solid partition extending all the way from floor to ceiling may be
necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Certain 14- and 15-year-olds may be employed inside
and outside of establishments that use power-driven machinery to process wood
products under specified conditions (FLSA § 13(c)(7)).  The provisions of this
limited exemption are discussed in detail in FOH 33e06.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Section 570.34 permits the employment of 14- and
15-year-olds in certain processing occupations; for example, limited cooking
tasks, office work such as photocopying, and hand polishing of cars and trucks
are permitted. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c03. CL Reg 3 and the Hazardous Occupations Orders (HOs).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Section 3(l) of the FLSA, which
defines “oppressive child labor,” prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from
performing those occupations which the Secretary of Labor finds and declares to
be particularly hazardous for the employment of children between such ages or
detrimental to their health or well-being.  Under this authority, the Secretary
has issued 17 nonagricultural HOs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Although the HOs are written
specifically to regulate the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds, the
prohibitions established by the HOs are equally applicable to the employment of
14- and 15-year-olds because of CL Reg 3 (see 29 CFR 570.33(b)). 
This section incorporates into the list of occupations prohibited to 14- and
15-year-olds any occupation prohibited by an HO.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
CL Reg 3 and the HOs work together
to provide a safe work place for 14-and 15-year-olds.  Provisions in CL Reg 3
will not only overlap those of the HOs but will often be broader than those
contained in the HOs.  For example:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  HO 2 prohibits minors from working as outside helpers
on motor vehicles; CL Reg 3 prohibits all work as helpers on motor vehicles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 7 prohibits the operation, and in some cases
“assisting to operate,” power-driven hoisting equipment.  CL Reg 3 bans the
operation and the tending of all hoisting equipment, whether power-driven or
manually driven. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  HO 11 prohibits the operation of certain power-driven
bakery machines.  CL Reg 3 bans all baking activities by 14- and 15-year-olds.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c04. Operation of hoisting apparatus, including forklifts.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR 570.33(c) prohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from operating, tending,
setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing all hoisting apparatus. 
The term “hoist” refers to any apparatus for raising or lowering a load by the
application of a pulling force that does not include a car or platform running
in guides.  29 CFR 570.34(n) prohibits these same minors from performing
work using &quot;lifting apparatus&quot; in connection with automobiles and
trucks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The CL Reg 3 prohibition against
the operation of hoists is much broader than that of HO 7.  Under CL Reg 3,
unlike HO 7, prohibited hoists do not have to be power-driven but can rely on
mechanical or human power such as those that are operated by a “crank” or foot
pedal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Under CL Reg 3, the term hoist includes all types of
hoists, such as base-mounted electric, clevis suspension, hook suspension,
monorail, overhead electric, simple drum and trolley suspension hoists.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Under CL Reg 3, 14- and 15-year-olds are prohibited
from using most kinds of hoisting and lifting equipment, such as hydraulic “grease
rack” lifts used in gasoline service stations, tire stores and other
establishments servicing automobiles, as well as service racks and hand jacks,
even if that machinery did not fit within the definition of a hoist or lifting
apparatus, because Reg 3 does not explicitly permit the use of such equipment. 
See 29 CFR 570.32.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Forklifts</b>.  A forklift is a type of power-driven industrial
highlift truck used for lateral transportation.  It is equipped with a
power-operated device, usually in the form of a fork or platform, capable of
tiering loaded pallets or skids one above the other.  Minors 14- and
15-years-old may not operate or tend a forklift under CL Reg 3 because it is
both a hoist and a piece of power-driven machinery.  These CL Reg 3 prohibitions
also preclude 14- and 15-year-olds from riding on a forklift and working from a
forklift.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Dumbwaiters</b>.  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are generally prohibited
from operating any hoisting devices, but 29 CFR 570.34(i) permits such minors
to operate dumbwaiters when used to perform work involved with the preparing
and serving of food.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Minors 14 and 15 years of age
would also be prohibited from operating or tending those hoists found in large
retail stores that are designed to move individual shopping carts from one
floor to the next.  These devices, often constructed in conjunction with
escalators, are both power-driven machinery and hoisting machines.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c05. Work performed in or about boiler or engine rooms, or in the
maintenance or repair of   the establishment, machines, or equipment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(d) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in or about boiler or engine rooms and  in
connection with the maintenance and repair of the establishment, machines, or
equipment.  Maintenance would generally include the cleaning of such machines
or equipment.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
CL Reg 3 includes certain
exceptions to the above maintenance (cleaning) prohibitions regarding kitchen
equipment and motor vehicles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Kitchen Equipment.  29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and
15-year-olds to clean kitchen equipment (not otherwise prohibited by CL Reg 3
or the Hazardous Occupations Orders) under certain conditions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Such minors may clean kitchen
equipment, remove oil or grease filters, pour oil or grease through filters,
and move receptacles containing hot grease or hot oil, but only when the
equipment surfaces, containers and liquids do not exceed a temperature of 100
°F.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
Questions have been raised as to
how compliance with this provision can be achieved and maintained—that the
temperature of equipment, surfaces, containers and liquids being cleaned,
filtered and/or transported do not exceed 100 °F (see 69 FR 75399, December 16,
2004).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
In some situations,
employer-installed thermometers could ensure that the required temperature has
been reached. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A.   
Cleaning schedules that
incorporate adequate “cooling down” periods, or that are executed before the
heating elements of the equipment are activated, can help ensure compliance
with this provision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>B.   
Clearly articulating policies that
require compliance to managers and other employees and monitoring can help
ensure compliance with this provision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>C.   
OSHA has advised WH that an individual
performing such cleaning functions would not normally experience a first degree
burn until the equipment, surfaces, containers and liquids being cleaned,
filtered and/or transported reached a temperature of at least 140 °F. 
Accordingly, it is WHD’s position that, generally, a violation of 29 CFR
570.34(i) has occurred whenever a covered 14- or 15-year-old employee received
at least a first degree burn while performing these named duties.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
CL Reg 3 does not prohibit a minor
from performing the normal grill “maintenance” that an employee routinely does
during the actual cooking process involving the use of water and a spatula to
scrape away and remove food particles and grease from the surface of the
grill.  This position applies only to electric and gas grills that do not
involve cooking with open flames (see 69 FR 75388, December 16, 2004).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Motor Vehicles.  29 CFR 570.34(n) permits 14- and
15-year-olds to perform work in connection with cars and trucks if confined to
the following:  dispensing gasoline and oil; courtesy services such as window
washing and checking oil levels; car cleaning, washing and polishing that is
done by hand; and other occupations permitted by CL Reg 3, but not
including work involving the use of pits, racks, or lifting apparatus, or
involving the inflation of any tire mounted on a rim equipped with a removable
retaining ring.  This exception does not allow 14- and 15-year-olds to operate
or maintain automatic car wash equipment or systems.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c06  . Operation or tending of power-driven machines.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(e) generally
prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from occupations which involve the operating,
tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing of any
power-driven machinery other than office machines.  Exceptions to this general
prohibition are also provided for certain food service related equipment as per
29 CFR 570.34(c) and certain work in connection with cars and trucks as per
29 CFR 570.34(n).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The term power-driven machinery as
used by CL Reg 3 is very broad, and includes machines driven by electrical,
mechanical, water, or other power such as steam or hydraulic.  It also includes
battery-operated machines and tools but does not apply to machines or tools
driven exclusively by hand or foot power (see 75 FR 28408).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
To emphasize the fact that CL Reg
3 prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from operating and tending almost all
power-driven equipment, § 570.33(e) lists particular pieces of equipment that
have historically been the source of child labor violations.  This list is
designed to provide clarity and is not exhaustive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Tending of power-driven machinery
is also interpreted broadly under CL Reg 3 and generally encompasses all
activities associated with the operation of such machinery, including but not
limited to: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Setting up, adjusting, cleaning, fueling, oiling,
maintaining, inspecting, transporting, and repairing such machinery. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Loading materials into the machinery and removing
materials from the machinery.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Monitoring of machinery to ensure that it is operating
properly.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Individuals who assist the operators of machinery—in
such matters as ensuring that there is a clear path of movement for the
machine, ensuring that the load the machine is carrying or transporting is
properly balanced or distributed, providing direction for the placement of a
load (as in the case of a forklift), and providing physical or verbal
assistance in the steering of machinery—would all be performing tending activities
under CL Reg 3.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Tending includes assisting passengers on and off such
power-driven machinery as a ski lift, an amusement park ride, or a slide at a
water park (when water is pumped to the top of the slide).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
The following are WH enforcement
positions relating to the operation and/or tending of certain pieces of
power-machinery.  A discussion regarding power-driven kitchen equipment and
food processing equipment is contained in FOH 33c12.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Vacuum
cleaners and floor waxers.  In addition to certain office machines (see
FOH 33d01) and kitchen equipment (see FOH 33c12), CL Reg
3 permits 14- and 15-year-olds to operate vacuum cleaners and floor waxers (see
29 CFR 570.34(h)).  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a.    
The term floor waxers refers to
those combination or multipurpose floor care machines designed to strip wax
from floors, reapply wax, and buff or polish floors.  Such machines, also
called buffers, burnishers, and polishers, consist of a motor housed above a
circular rotating horizontal surface to which various pads or brushes may be
attached, depending upon the task to be performed.  The operator directs the
movement of the machine using a handle that rises perpendicular to the base of
the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b.    
The term floor waxers does not
include the above described machines when used to sand or refinish floors, as
such equipment would generally be prohibited under HO 5 (Occupations involved
in the operation of power-driven wood-working machines).  In addition, CL Reg 3
prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in processing and construction
occupations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c.    
The term floor waxers does not
include any floor stripper, cleaner, scrubber, burnisher or polisher upon which
the operator may ride while operating the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2)  Power-driven mowers.  29 CFR 570.33(e) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations involving the operating or
tending of power-driven machinery, and specifically names lawn mowers. 
Furthermore, Hazardous Occupations Order 2 (HO 2) would prohibit anyone under
the age of 18 from operating a riding lawn mower when used as a means of
transportation on public roads or highways (see FOH 33h02(e)(3)).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;(3) 
Cutters,
including weed trimmers and “weed eaters”.  The prohibitions of 29 CFR
570.33(e) include operating or tending power-driven “cutters” such as weed
trimmers, “weed eaters,” and hedge trimmers.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(4)  Golf carts and all terrain vehicles (ATVs).  29 CFR
570.33(e) prohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from operating or tending
power-driven machinery, including golf carts and ATVs. 
29 CFR 570.33(f) prohibits these same minors from being employed in
occupations involving the operation of motor vehicles.  As golf carts and ATV’s
are power-driven machines that are also motor vehicles, no one under 16 years
of age may operate or tend such machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a.    
These CL Reg 3 prohibitions are
much broader than those of HO 2.  The CL Reg 3 prohibitions are not restricted
to the operation of the motor vehicle on “public roads or highways.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b.    
The operation of a golf cart or an
ATV would also be prohibited under HO 2 if the minor were operating the vehicle
as a means of transportation on a public road or highway (see FOH
33e02c(2)(b)).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;(5) 
“Cart
Caddy” and “QuicKART”.  29 CFR 507.33(e) prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from
operating or tending power-driven machinery.  This would include the “Cart
Caddy,” “QuicKART,” and similar pieces of equipment. &lt;p&gt;a.    
The “Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART”
are two types of power-driven machines often used by grocers and other retail
stores to move large strings of shopping carts.  These machines are hooked to
the last shopping cart in a string and then the operator guides the string of
carts back to the store while commanding the machine to move by means of a
hand-held remote control.  The operator walks behind the machine and operates
the manual throttle when returning to the parking lot to collect more carts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b.    
As these machines are not
considered to be “motor vehicles” as defined in HO 2, they do not fall within
the scope of HO 2.  Sixteen- and 17-year-old minors are permitted to operate
these machines (see FOH 33h02(e)(2)).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;(6) 
Office
machines.  29 CFR 570.33(e) and 570.34(a) permit 14- and 15-year-old minors to
operate office machines.  Office machines that may be operated by 14- and
15-year-old minors include computers, typewriters, electric staplers, printers,
copiers, cash registers, pencil sharpeners, automatic letter openers, adding
machines and calculators, postage machines, automatic filing systems, VCRs, and
digital cameras.  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(7)  Paper shredders.  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may
operate “office type” paper shredders in an office setting as part of “office
work.”  CL Reg 3 prohibits such youth from operating paper shredders in an
industrial or recycling setting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;(8) 
Amusement
park and water park rides.  The CL Reg 3 general prohibition against the
operation and tending of power-driven machinery includes the operating or
tending of all power-driven amusement park and water amusement park rides.  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;a.    
Tending
would include such duties as assisting riders as they enter and leave the ride,
checking to ensure seat belts are properly fastened, and policing the area to
ensure the ride is operated safely. b.    
These
prohibitions extend to most power-driven rides and attractions at water parks
as well.  29 CFR 570.34(l)(1) specifically prohibits all minors under 16 years
of age from working as dispatchers at the top of elevated water slides (see
FOH 33d06(d)(2)).  Note that certain activities may be performed by
properly certified 15 year old lifeguards at traditional swimming pools and
water amusement parks (including such water park facilities as wave pools, lazy
rivers, specialized activity areas that may include water falls and sprinkler
areas, and at the receiving or splashdown areas of the elevated water slides
(see 29 CFR 570.34(l)(1); see also  FOH  33d06).&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHD
FLSA Non-Administrator Letter January 17, 2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c.    
In addition, 29 CFR 570.33(f)
prohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from operating a motor vehicle or serving
as helpers on such vehicles.  Some amusement park rides or equipment, such as
go-carts, coaches, and equipment used in daily parades, meet the definition of
motor vehicles (for purposes of Reg. 3, WHD uses the definition of motor
vehicle from HO 2, 29 CFR 570.52(c)(1)).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d.    
29 CFR 570.33(n)(1) prohibits 14-
and 15-year-olds from performing occupations in connection with the
transportation of persons or property by rail, highway, air, water, pipeline or
other means.  Some amusement park rides, such as boats, paddle boats, “swan
rides,” ferries, and railroads, fall within this prohibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e.    
The operation of amusement park
rides is not prohibited for 16- and 17-year-old minors under Hazardous
Occupations Order 7 (HO 7).  Although a number of rides in amusement and theme
parks have characteristics similar to certain machines that minors are
prohibited from operating under HO 7, they are not derricks,
cranes, hoists, elevators, or manlifts
as defined by the HO (see FOH 33h07(c)).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(9) 
Conveyors.  See FOH
33c17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;(10) 
Automatic
elevators.  CL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from operating “automatic”
freight elevators and automatic combined passenger/freight elevators.  Such
youth may operate and ride in fully automatic passenger elevators as found in
most office buildings.  See FOH 33h07.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<h3>33c07. Motor vehicles and service as helpers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(f) prohibits 14- and
15-year-olds from occupations involving the operation of motor vehicles or
serving as helpers on such vehicles.  This same section prohibits such youth
from riding on a motor vehicle, inside or outside of an enclosed passenger
compartment, except as permitted by § 570.34(o) (see FOH 33c07(d)).  In
addition, 29 CFR 570.33(k) prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from loading and
unloading goods or property to and from motor vehicles, railroad cars, or
conveyors, except for those hand tools, personal protective equipment and
personal items specifically permitted by § 570.34(k).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The term motor vehicle, defined in
29 CFR 570.52(c)(1), means any automobile, truck, truck-tractor, trailer,
semitrailer, motorcycle, or similar vehicle propelled or drawn by mechanical
power and designed for use as a means of transportation but does not include
any vehicle operated exclusively on rails.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  A motor vehicle does not have to be designed for use on
public roads, or actually be used on public roads, to fall within the
prohibitions of CL Reg 3.  This differs from the prohibitions of HO 2 (see
29 CFR 570.52).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  In addition to the examples listed in 29 CFR
570.52(c)(1), WH has made the following determinations regarding the definition
of a motor vehicle under 29 CFR part 570: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Power-driven golf carts and all
terrain vehicles (ATVs) are motor vehicles (see 75 FR 28408, see
also FOH 33h02(3)).  The “Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART,” two types of machines
often used by grocers and other retail stores to move large strings of shopping
carts, are not considered to be motor vehicles under 29 CFR part
570 (see FOH  33h07(c)(5) and  33c06(e)(5)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Certain amusement park rides or
equipment, such as go-carts, parade vehicles, and coaches, are motor vehicles
as defined by 29 CFR 570.52(c) (see FOH 33c06(e)(8)).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The term motor vehicle helper is
not defined in CL Reg 3.  Reg 3 prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from “service as
helpers on such vehicles”.  This provision has been included in CL Reg 3,
without change, since the inception of the regulations as a temporary rule in
1938.  WH’s interpretation of the term motor vehicle helper has evolved over
the years and was influenced by the definition of outside helper contained in
HO 2 (see 29 CFR 570.52(c)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  For purposes of CL Reg 3, WH considers a helper on a
motor vehicle to be one whose employment assists in the operation of a motor
vehicle used in the transportation or delivery of persons or property.  Duties
may include assisting in the pick-up and/or delivery of people or property, the
loading or unloading of the vehicle, shifting property around the vehicle,
assisting the driver of the vehicle or other helpers on motor vehicles.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  A helper on a motor vehicle does not have to
ultimately ride as a passenger, either inside or outside of the vehicle, to be
considered a helper under CL Reg 3.  But the mere fact that a minor rides as a
passenger on a vehicle during working hours does not make that minor a “helper”
under CL Reg 3.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Section 570.34(k) permits 14- and
15-year-olds to load onto and unload from motor vehicles the light, personal,
non-powered hand tools, personal protective equipment, and other personal items
that they will use as part of their employment under certain conditions (see
FOH 33d05).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Youth peddling and door-to-door
salespersons as motor vehicle helpers</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
Section 570.33(j) prohibits the
employment of minors under 16 years of age in youth peddling or as door-to-door
salespersons—selling such things as candy, greeting cards, calendars, etc. 
Youth peddlers often perform motor vehicle helper duties prohibited by CL Reg 3
(see FOH 33c07(c)(2)b.).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
Minors who are illegally employed
as youth peddlers often do more than simply ride in the crew leader’s van or
automobile while being transported to the sales areas—they often facilitate the
sales operations by performing such activities as sorting merchandise and
packing peddler’s kits while in transit, or loading and unloading the
merchandise being sold.  When performing these tasks, the youth peddlers are
also engaged as helpers on a motor vehicle under CL Reg 3.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
Minors who merely ride in the crew
leader’s vehicle and perform no activities that facilitate the movement of the
persons or property being transported would not be considered to be helpers on
a motor vehicle under CL Reg 3.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>(d)  </b><b>Riding as a passenger on motor vehicles</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  29 CFR 570.34(o) permits 14- and 15-year-olds to ride
inside passenger compartments of motor vehicles when:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
They are not the operator of the
vehicle,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
They are not serving as a helper
on the vehicle,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
A significant reason for them
being a passenger in the vehicle is not to perform work in connection with
transporting, or assisting in the transporting, of other persons or property,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Each minor riding in the passenger
compartment must have his or her own seat, each seat must be equipped with a
seat belt or similar restraining device, and the employer must instruct the
minors that such belts or other devices must be used.  This requirement is similar
to those contained in FLSA § 13(c)(6) and 29 CFR 570.52(b) (see FOH
33h02(d)(1)), and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
Each driver transporting the young
workers must hold a State driver’s license valid for the type of driving
involved and, if the driver is under the age of 18, his or her employment must
comply with the provisions of § 570.52.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Should any of the requirements detailed in FOH
33c07(d)(1) not be met, a violation of CL Reg 3 has most likely occurred.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c08. Outside window washing.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Section
570.33(g) prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from performing outside window washing
that involves working from a sill (see FOH 33c09).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c09. Ladders, scaffolds or their substitutes.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Section 570.33(g) prohibits 14-
and 15-year-olds from performing all work requiring the use of ladders,
scaffolds, or their substitutes.  This prohibition is not just confined to
tasks involved with outside window washing.</p>
<p>(b)  
Although CL Reg 3 does not define
the term ladder, regulations issued by DOL’s Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) do.  WH relies upon this definition when enforcing the
child labor provisions of the FLSA. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
WHD FLSA Opinion Letter September
2, 2003</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.21(c)(1), a
ladder is “an appliance usually consisting of two side rails joined at regular
intervals by cross-pieces called steps, rungs, or cleats, on which a person may
step in ascending or descending.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
Under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.21(c)(2), a
stepladder means “a self-supporting portable ladder, nonadjustable in length,
having flat steps and a hinged back.  Its size is designated by the overall
length of the ladder measured along the front edge of the side rails.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)  
Section 570.34(l)(2) permits
properly certified 15-year-olds who are employed as lifeguards to use a ladder
to access and descend from the lifeguard chair (see FOH 33d06(c)(10)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)  
WH has adopted an enforcement
position that permits 14- and- 15-year-olds who are otherwise employed in
compliance with the provisions of 29 CFR part 570 to use a one- or two-step
foot stool or stepladder as part of their employment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)  WHD FLSA Opinion Letter September 2, 2003</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c10. Baking.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
29 CFR 570.33(h) prohibits 14- and
15-year-olds from performing all baking activities.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
Under CL Reg 3, baking is a
“process” and prohibited activities include such things as the weighing,
measuring, and mixing of ingredients; placing or assembling products in pans or
on trays; operating ovens (including placing items in ovens and removing items
from ovens); placing items on cooling trays or racks; and finishing or icing
baked products (see 69 FR 75383, December 16, 2004, for more
information). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
This prohibition on performing
activities that are steps in the baking process precludes 14- and 15-year-olds
from assembling pizzas just prior to baking.  This is true even if older workers
will actually place the pizzas in the ovens and remove them from the ovens.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
The ban on baking precludes 14-
and 15-year-olds from operating almost all ovens, including convection ovens,
microwave ovens (except those used for warming foods as described in
FOH 33c10(b)(2), below), pizza ovens, automatic feeding ovens, and high
speed ovens.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
High speed ovens.  Fourteen and
fifteen year olds are prohibited from cooking or baking with high speed ovens
that operate using a combination of high speed air impingement, infrared
browning elements, microwaves, and catalytic converters.  These ovens, which
can operate at temperatures of 500 °F, can quickly cook a wide variety of food
items.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
These ovens, including models
manufactured by TurboChef called the Tornado, the C3, and the High h Batch, are
often used by quick service restaurants to bake or “toast” submarine sandwiches
and pizzas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.             
Such equipment may not be
considered a “toaster” that would be permitted under 29 CFR 570.34(i) (see FOH
33c12(b)(2)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.             
Enforcement experience indicates
that these high speed ovens are used in a variety of food service
establishments, hotels and theaters.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
Microwave ovens.  Fourteen- and
15-year-olds may operate microwave ovens that, in accordance with § 570.34(i),
are used only to warm prepared food and do not have the capacity to work above
140 °F.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c11. Cooking.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
29 CFR 570.33(h) generally
prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from performing any cooking except that which is
permitted by § 570.34(c).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
Such minors may cook with electric
and gas grills that do not involve cooking over an open flame (see §
570.34(c)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
The cooking surface of the grill
must be solid to ensure the minors do not cook over an open flame.  These
provisions preclude 14- and 15-year-olds from cooking over charcoal flames,
open fires, and those gas and electric grills that do not utilize a “solid
slab” cooking surface.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
Some electric and gas grills have
solid cooking surfaces on top, but are also equipped with a broiler under the
grill that takes advantage of the single source of heat (electric element or
gas flame).  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may cook with such grills but may not
use the broilers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
The regulations (see § 570.34(c))
also specifically mention that such minors may not cook with such equipment as
rotisseries, broilers, pressurized equipment including fryolators, and cooking
devices that operate at extremely high temperatures such as “Neico broilers” (see
FOH 33c12(b)(3)).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)           
Such minors may cook with deep
fryers that are equipped with and utilize a device which automatically lowers
the baskets into the hot oil or grease and automatically raises the baskets
from the hot oil or grease (see § 570.34(c)). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
The regulations require that the
product being deep fried be contained in a “basket” during the frying process. 
Therefore, 14- and 15-year-olds could not be employed to deep fry products that
are placed into and removed from the hot fat or grease via some other utensil
(tongs, fork, stick, etc.).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may not
manually operate (raise or lower) such baskets.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
On February 14, 2005, a final rule
revising portions of 29 CFR part 570 became effective.  This rule, among other
things, established the types of cooking duties that 14- and 15-year-olds may
legally perform as discussed above.  Prior to February 14, 2005, such minors
could cook only at soda fountains, lunch counters, snack bars, or cafeteria
serving lines.  WH interpreted this provision to mean that all cooking by this
age group had to be performed “in plain view” of the customer.  The “in plain
view” rule ended effective February 14, 2005.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
The rules concerning the cleaning
of kitchen equipment by 14- and 15-year-olds are discussed in
FOH 33d04(e).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c12. Power-driven kitchen equipment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Although <a name="OLE_LINK4"></a><a name="OLE_LINK3">29 CFR 570.33(h</a>) prohibits minors 14 and 15 years of age
from performing most cooking tasks, § 570.34(i) permits such minors to perform
occupations involved in preparing and serving food and beverages, including
operating machines used to perform such work.  Machines such youth are
permitted to operate include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Electric and gas grills that do not involve cooking
the product over an open flame,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Deep fryers that utilize baskets to contain the food
product being cooked and which are equipped with and utilize a device that
automatically lowers the basket into the hot oil or grease and automatically
raises the basket out of the hot oil or grease,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Dishwashers,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Toasters (see FOH 33c12(b)(2)),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Dumbwaiters if limited to kitchen work involving the
preparation and serving of food,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Popcorn poppers,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  Milk shake blenders, including blenders used to make
“smoothies,” frapuccinos, and fruit drinks,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)  Coffee grinders,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9)  Automatic coffee machines, including espresso and
cappuccino machines (see 75 FR 28409),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(10)  Devices used to maintain the temperature of prepared
foods, such as warmers, steam tables, and heat lamps (even if the temperature
exceeds 140 °F),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(11)  Microwave ovens that are used only to warm prepared
food and do not have the capacity to warm above 140 °F,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(12)  Cotton candy machines (see FOH
33c12(b)(6)), and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(13)  “Sno Cone,” “Snow Cone,” and Italian ice machines (see
FOH 33c12(b)(9)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are
prohibited from operating many other pieces of power-driven equipment used in
kitchens and food service establishments.  Below are specific pieces of
power-driven kitchen equipment that are cited in the regulations or upon which
WH has formally opined.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Toasters.  29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and
15-year-old minors to operate certain machines, including toasters.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
WH has long interpreted the term
toaster to mean that type of equipment that was generally found in snack bars
and lunch counters when CL Reg 3 was issued and used to toast such items as
slices of bread and English muffins.  This includes such equipment as the two-
or four-slice “pop-up” toasters similar to those manufactured for home use and
the small conveyor-type bread toasters now often found at self-service
breakfast buffets (see 75 FR 28409).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Broilers, automatic broiler
systems, high speed ovens, and rapid toaster machines used at quick service
restaurants to toast such items as buns, bagels, and muffins—all of which
operate at high temperatures, often in excess of 500 degrees Fahrenheit—are not
toasters under CL Reg 3 and minors must be at least 16 years of age to operate
them (see 75 FR 28409).  One rapid toaster that 14- and 15-year-olds are not
permitted to operate is the Model VCT-200. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Broilers, including Automatic Broiler Systems  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are
prohibited from performing all baking activities, including operating most
ovens, and from cooking with all broilers.  Some electric and gas grills that
have solid cooking surfaces on top, are also equipped with a broiler under the
grill that takes advantage of the single source of heat (electric element or
gas flame).  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may cook with such grills, but may not
use the broilers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Automatic Broiler Systems (see
29 CFR 570.34(c)).  Fourteen and fifteen year olds are prohibited from
operating automatic broilers and cooking systems, such as those produced by the
Neico Automatic Broilers.  NEICO broilers – also called Flexi-Chef® Cooking
Systems – and other automatic broiler systems use a combination of convection
and radiant heat to flame broil a wide variety of items.  These items include
ribs, chicken, steak, hamburgers, seafood, nachos, vegetables and breadsticks. 
Automatic broilers, which can be powered by electric, natural gas, or propane,
often operate at temperatures in excess of 500 °F.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
Automatic broilers may operate
using a conveyor or system of conveyors.  The product is simply placed on the
conveyor at the feed-end and it flows through to the discharge-end, flame
broiled on both sides at the same time.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
On some systems, called
return-flow broilers, the product is both fed and returned on the same end of
the broiler.  Some automatic broilers also feature up to four independently
timed conveyor belts, allowing the user to broil up to four separate items at
the same time.  The broilers may also have a “meat holding unit” for limited
product holding after broiling and a “bun-grill” for toasting buns.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
Enforcement experience indicates
that these automatic broilers are used in a variety of food service
establishments. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Rotisseries (see 29 CFR 570.34(c)).  A
rotisserie is a device that cooks food while it slowly rotates.  Heating
sources may be electricity, gas, charcoal, or wood.  A rotisserie contains a
spit fitted with a pair of prongs that slide along its length. Food (usually
meat) is impaled on the spit and the prongs (which are inserted on each side of
the food) are screwed tightly into place to hold the food securely. Modern
rotisseries have a motor that automatically turns the shaft, while their
predecessors relied on human power.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are
prohibited from cooking with rotisseries.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Not included in the CL Reg 3
prohibition regarding the operation of rotisseries would be those pieces of
equipment, often used at movie theaters, amusement parks, and snack bars, that
heat and maintain the temperature of pre-cooked hot dogs and sausages.  Such
permitted pieces of equipment include “roller grills” consisting of a
horizontal surface composed of a series or rotating cylinders upon which the
hot dogs are heated and “rotisserie cabinets” where the hot dogs are placed on
“spikes” or “cradles” and then “orbit” around or past a heat source.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Power-driven food slicers, grinders, choppers, and
mixers </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR 570.33(e) prohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from performing occupations
which involve operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or
repairing power-driven food slicers and grinders, food choppers, food
processors, food cutters, and food mixers.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
These occupations are prohibited
under CL Reg 3 regardless of the material being processed by such machines. 
This prohibition is much broader than that contained in HO 10 (see 75 FR
28409).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Power-driven bagel slicers are
food slicers under CL Reg 3 and are therefore prohibited.  This prohibition is
much broader than that contained in HO 14 and the enforcement position
discussed in FOH 33h11(e).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Bakery-type mixers </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
CL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and
15-year-olds from operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling,
or repairing power-driven food mixers regardless of the product being
processed, the size of the mixer, or the blade or attachment being used.  This
prohibition is much broader than that imposed by HO 11, Occupations involved in
the operation of bakery machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
Although HO 11 (see 29 CFR
570.62(b)(1)) provides an exception that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to operate
certain lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top power-driven food
mixers, this exception does not apply to those under 16 years of age (see
FOH 33h11(d)(2)d).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Dairy Queen Blizzard Flavor Treat
Machine/Whisper Quiet Mix-N-Blend Machine  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
“Blizzard,” a trademarked product of Dairy Queen, is made from soft ice cream. 
Although somewhat similar to a milk shake, the Blizzard is very thick and
cannot be poured.  The customer selects ingredients, such as chocolate, fruit,
or different kinds of candy, to be added to the soft ice cream.  All the
ingredients are placed in a cup and then blended or mixed by the Blizzard
machine.  Because these machines act as a milk shake blender, a machine
specifically permitted by 29 CFR 570.34(i), 14- and 15-year-olds may
operate both the Dairy Queen Blizzard Flavor Treat machine or the Whisper Quiet
Mix-N-Blend Machine.  </p>
<p> &lt;p&gt;(5)  Cotton candy machines.  CL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14-
and 15-year-olds from operating most standard cotton candy machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a.    
The operator of the cotton candy
machine puts sugar crystals into a cylinder in the center of the machine.  The
sugar crystals are heated by hot air from an enclosed element to a soft liquid
consistency.  The liquid sugar is then spun out into a fluff that collects
within the bowl of the machine.  The operator takes a cardboard cone and twirls
it around just inside the surface of the bowl picking up the spun cotton candy
until the cone is filled to a serving size.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b.    
29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and
15-year-old-minors to perform kitchen work and other work involved in preparing
and serving food and beverages, including the operation of machines and devices
used in the performance of such work, such as but not limited to, dishwashers,
toasters, dumbwaiters, popcorn poppers, milk shake blenders, and coffee
grinders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.    
Most cotton candy machines are
designed in such a manner to present few hazards to the operator, and the
operator is exposed to none of the moving parts of the machine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.    
This machine operates in a fashion
similar to a popcorn popper, which is a permitted piece of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(6)  Waffle irons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a.    
CL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14- and
15-year-olds from cooking with electric waffle irons, including those used in
restaurants and ice cream shops to make “waffle cones.”  These waffle irons are
similar to electric grills, with solid heating elements powered by
electricity.  They do not involve cooking over an open flame, do not operate at
extremely high temperatures, and their operation does not constitute “baking”
under 29 CFR 570.33(h).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b.    
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may
also clean such waffle irons as long as the equipment and surfaces do not
exceed a temperature of 100 °F (see 29 CFR 570.34(i)). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(7)  Two-sided grills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a.    
CL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14- and
15-year-olds from cooking with electric or gas two-sided grills such as those
manufactured by Garland Commercial Industries under the name Master Series
Xpress Grills.  This equipment consists of a standard gas or electric grill
that is equipped with electric platen heaters that can be lowered
(automatically or manually) onto the food product to allow for two-sided
cooking.  Such equipment operates similar to a waffle iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b.    
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may
also clean such two-sided grills as long as the equipment and surfaces do not
exceed a temperature of 100 °F (see 29 CFR 570.34(i)). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(8)  Ice chippers, grinders and shavers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a.    
CL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and
15-year-olds from operating and tending most power-driven machinery used to
grind or shave ice.  Such machines are often used in restaurants, grocery
stores, concession stands, amusement parks, and industrial settings to process
ice.  They range greatly in size, horsepower, and the amount of ice they can
process per hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b.    
“Sno Cone,” “Snow Cone,” and
“Italian Ice” Machines &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.    
WH will not, however, assert a
violation of CL Reg 3 when 14- and 15-year-olds operate ice grinders and
shavers that are designed and used to produce “sno cones,” “snow cones,” and
“Italian ice”—products that consist of a single serving of ice which is then covered
with flavored syrup.  These machines are designed in such a manner to present
few hazards to the operator, and it appears that the operator is exposed to
none of the moving parts of the machine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.    
Machines included under this
enforcement position are often found at concession stands at parks, theaters,
swimming pools, fairs, and other amusement venues.  The machines may be free
standing units, table top units, or contained in specially constructed
snow-cone carts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.    
Ice grinding and shaving machines
included under this enforcement position may be electric, gas, or battery
operated, but the horsepower of the motors may not exceed ½ horsepower.  The
maximum output of such machines may not exceed 500 pounds of “snow” per hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.    
WH will not charge a violation
when 14- and 15-year-olds operate the ice grinding and shaving equipment
described in this subsection.  They may also perform limited tending functions
such as loading ice into the machine, cleaning the exterior of the machine, and
cleaning the compartment that holds the crushed or shaved ice.  Such youth may
not assemble or disassemble the machine or perform any work that entails
contact with moving parts that grind or shave the ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.    
Manufacturers whose equipment have
been found to meet the requirements of this enforcement position include
SnoKonette models 1002, 1003, 1203, 1803, and 1903; Paragon models PA-6133110,
PA-6133210, and PA-6133410; Echols models GWP-1360, GWP-117, GWP-103, and
GWP-123. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<h3>33c13. Work in freezers and meat coolers and in the preparation of meats
for sale.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(i) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in work in freezers and meat coolers.  These
same regulations ban most work in the preparation of meat for sale.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
For example, minors would be
prohibited from working as dairy stock clerks handling ice cream, meat clerks,
deli clerks, or frozen-food stock clerks, where their duties would require them
to enter and remain in meat coolers or freezers for prolonged periods of time. 
CL Reg 3 also prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from taking inventory or
performing cleanup work which would require the minors to remain in the freezer
or meat cooler for extended periods of time (see 75 FR 28411-12).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  A meat cooler for purposes of 29 CFR 570.33(i), is any
confined, refrigerated area within a retail or food service establishment where
meat products are received, cut, trimmed, or otherwise processed, stored and
handled.  A meat cooler will often contain equipment such as band saws, meat
grinders, slicers, and other dangerous power-driven machinery.  It may also
have conveyor systems to move products and a “wrapping station” to package
products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Not included in the definition of a meat cooler are
those coolers that are used merely to store items such as beverages, produce,
dairy products, and/or prepackaged meat products such as hot dogs, luncheon
meats or bacon.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Also not included in the definition of meat cooler are
those refrigerated rooms – often found in convenience stores and located
directly behind and attached to sales cases – from which employees can
replenish stocks of beverages, dairy products (non-frozen), and prepackaged
meat products.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Fourteen- and 15-year-old
employees may occasionally enter freezers only momentarily to retrieve items
(see 29 CFR 570.34(i)).  For example, a minor who works in an ice cream shop
may occasionally be required to enter a freezer to obtain a new carton of ice
cream.  In such circumstances, the minor is not considered to be working in a
freezer.  Such minors may not enter meat coolers, even momentarily.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c14. Youth peddling.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(j) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds as youth peddlers or door-to-door
salespersons.  Youth peddling entails the selling of goods or services to
customers at locations other than the youth employer's establishment, such as
the customers' residences or places of business, or public places such as
street corners or public transportation stations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  This provision does not prohibit a young salesperson
from conducting sales for his or her employer on property controlled by the
employer that is out of doors but may properly be considered part of the
employer's establishment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Youth may conduct sales in such employer exterior
facilities, whether temporarily or permanent, as garden centers, sidewalk
sales, and parking lots sales, when employed by that establishment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Prohibited activities associated
with youth peddling not only include the actual attempt to make a sale or the
actual consummation of a sale, but also the preparatory and concluding tasks
normally performed in conjunction with making the sales.  These prohibited
activities include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The loading and unloading of vans or other motor
vehicles; and the service as helpers on such vehicles (see FOH 33c07(c)(2)),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The stocking and restocking of sales kits and trays,
and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The exchanging of cash and checks with the employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Youth peddling does not include
the activities of persons who, as volunteers and without compensation, sell
goods or services on behalf of eleemosynary organizations or public agencies,
such as schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  WH considers individuals who volunteer or donate their
services, usually on a part-time basis, for public service, religious, or
humanitarian objections, without contemplation of pay, not to be employees of
the religious, charitable, or similarly nonprofit corporations that receive
their services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  As used in § 570.33(j), the term compensation does not
include the small prizes, trophies, or other awards of minimum value that the
eleemosynary organization may give a volunteer in recognition of his or her
efforts (see 75 FR 28413).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c15. Sign wavers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(j) generally
prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds as sign wavers - individuals
who as part of promotional activities hold, wear, and/or wave signs, costumes,
merchandise, sandwich boards, or placards in order to attract potential
customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The above provision does not
prohibit a 14- and 15-year-old from performing sign waving tasks when performed
inside of, or directly in front of, the employer’s establishment providing the
product, service, or event being advertised.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c16. Loading and unloading of goods or property onto or from motor
vehicles and railroad   cars.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(k) prohibits 14- and
15-year-olds from loading and unloading goods or property onto or from motor
vehicles, railroad cars, or conveyors.  Section 570.34(k), however, does permit
such youth to load and unload certain specified items onto and from motor
vehicles under certain circumstances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
FOH 33c17 discusses the use of
conveyors under CL Reg 3.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The prohibitions of § 570.33(k)
involve both goods and property.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c17. Loading and unloading of goods or property onto or from
conveyors.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(k) prohibits 14- and
15-year-olds from loading and unloading goods or property to or from
conveyors.  Under these regulations, conveyors need not be power-driven to be
prohibited—some conveyors operate by gravity.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Conveyors are not defined in the
regulations but include any mechanical device, such as a continuous moving
belt, auger, or series of rollers, that transports bulk materials or packages
from one place to another.  Conveyors are often found in warehouses, packing
sheds, manufacturing establishments, airports (including mobile equipment used
to load and move baggage and cargo), and retail establishments. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Other prohibitions of the CL Reg 3
standards, such as working in manufacturing, transportation, work rooms and
warehouses, or operating/tending power-driven machinery, may also prevent
minors from working with conveyors regardless of the industry or type of
establishment.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
WH does not interpret 29 CFR
570.33(k) to prohibit 14- and 15-year-olds from working with the types of
conveyors normally found at checkout counters in supermarkets and other retail
stores. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Such conveyors have solid surfaces, are fully
enclosed, and are designed with features that protect the hands and limbs of
both the operators and the customers who place materials on them or remove
purchases from them.  The cashier controls the operation of the conveyor
through a switch or foot pedal and the individual items placed on the conveyor
are neither large nor heavy.  There also may be other smaller conveyors located
beyond the cashier that transport the items that have been checked to a bin or
counter where they are bagged.  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may also work with
those types of conveyors. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  On the other hand, some stores may have an additional
type of conveyor system that is often located between the checkout station and
the customer vehicle loading area in the front of the store.  These conveyors
may use plastic bins or other storage compartments to hold bags of groceries
that are transported to the vehicle loading area.  These types of conveyors are
not enclosed, convey heavy loads, and may present hazards to young employees
who load and unload them.  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are prohibited from
operating such conveyors under both § 570.33(k) and under the CL Reg 3 general
prohibition against operating or tending power-driven equipment.  Such youth
are prohibited from operating or tending such conveyors and may not load or
unload materials to or from such equipment.  </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c18. Poultry catching and cooping.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(l) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds to catch and coop poultry in preparation for
transportation or for market.  Such activity, often referred to as
&quot;chicken catching,&quot; is also banned as a processing occupation by 29 CFR
570.33(a).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
This prohibition includes the
catching and cooping of all poultry, not just chickens.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
In those rare instances when the
catching activities would be agricultural in nature, such as where poultry
catchers are employed solely by a farmer on a farm to catch poultry raised by
that farmer, the catchers would be subject to the agricultural child labor
provisions contained in FLSA §§ 13(c)(1) and (2).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c19. Public messenger service.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(m) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in the occupation of public messenger
service.  The term public messenger service as used in this section means the
kind of messenger service performed by delivery companies (companies whose
principal business is the delivery of letters, messages, and/or parcels), and
also, to the extent the law applies to them, telegraph companies (see 75 FR
28415). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
CL Reg 3 does not prohibit the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds by firms other than public messenger
services as errand boys/girls to pick up and deliver messages or packages by
foot, bicycle, or public transportation (see 29 CFR 570.34(g)).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c20. Transportation of persons or property by rail, highway, air,
water, pipeline,   or other means.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(n)(1) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations connected with the
transportation of persons or property by rail, highway, air, water, pipeline,
or other means.  This prohibition involves the transportation of “persons or
property” and not just “goods” which entails movement in commerce.  In
addition, 29 CFR 570.33(k) prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from loading or
unloading most goods or property onto or from motor vehicles, railroad cars, or
conveyors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
This prohibition makes it unlawful
to employ 14- and 15-year-old minors in jobs clearly and directly related to
the operating, servicing, maintaining, or loading of media of transportation. 
CL Reg 3 does not, however, prohibit the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds to
pick up or deliver packages or messages—whether by foot, by bicycle, or by
riding on subways, buses, or taxis–as as long as the employer is not a public
messenger service (see FOH 33c19, see also 29 CFR 570.33(m)).  Such minors also
may perform office work or sales work that does not involve the performance of
any duties on media of transportation.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Occupations which are in
connection with transportation within the meaning of CL Reg 3 and are therefore
prohibited to 14- and 15-year-olds include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Jobs performed on trains, boats, buses, or other media
of transportation,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Jobs performed in, on, or in close proximity to
roundhouses, railway tracks, repair shops, docks or wharfs, hangars, runways,
or other such places where power-driven equipment designed or used for
transportation (including train cars) is repaired, cleaned, or serviced, or may
be in motion,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Jobs in loading or unloading railway cars or tanks,
trucks, boats, planes, buses, or other media of transportation, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Jobs that require riding in a motor vehicle.  Riding
in a motor vehicle would be prohibited under 29 CFR 570.33(f) if a significant
reason for the minor being a passenger in the vehicle is for the purpose of
transporting—or assisting in the transporting of—the persons or the property
(see § 570.34(o)).  The transportation of the persons or property does not have
to be the primary reason for the trip for this prohibition to apply (see FOH
33c07(d)).  </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c21. Warehousing and storage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(n)(2) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations in connection with
warehousing and storage, except they may perform office work or sales work for
such employers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Warehousing and storage, as used
in CL Reg 3, includes:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Public warehouses,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Cold storage warehouses,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Long distance moving and storage establishments,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Public storage facilities where consumers rent space
or containers to store property—whether the property is transported to the
facility by the consumer, by the storage facility, or by some other party,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Wholesale houses (except for certain work in wholesale
houses engaged in the distribution of newspapers and magazines, see
FOH 33c01(f)(2)e.),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Tobacco warehouses, except such employment in loose
leaf tobacco warehouses as ticket or tag person, waterperson, or sweeper during
tobacco auctions, which employment is more closely allied to sales work than to
warehousing and storage, but not excepting other occupations in the warehousing
of tobacco, such as regrading or rechecking tobacco, or handling heavy tobacco
baskets on the floor,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  Warehouses operated either as departments or as a
separate establishment by retail stores,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)  Warehouses and storage establishments operated either
as separate establishments or departments, by factories, canneries, and other
manufacturing and processing establishments, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9)  Planer mill lumber yards where lumber, green or dry,
is stacked and stored (see limited exception contained in FLSA §
13(c)(7) and discussed in FOH 33e06).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Warehousing and storage, as used
in CL Reg 3, does not include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Fresh fruit and vegetable packing sheds and
concentration points, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Stockrooms operated by retail stores as an incident to
selling and located on the same premises as the retail store.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c22. Communications and public utilities.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(n)(3) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations in connection with
communications and public utilities, except such youth may be employed in these
industries to perform office or sales work as long as the work is not performed
on trains, motor vehicles, aircraft, vessels, or other media of transportation
or at the actual site of construction operations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Communications</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Such “on-air” duties as announcing, reading
advertisements, and playing music on radio or television are exempt from the
child labor provisions under FLSA § 13(c)(3) (see FOH 33e01).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Operating a switchboard in a telephone exchange is an
occupation in connection with communication.  This work is not considered to be
“office work.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Answering the telephone and taking messages in a
telephone answering service or call center are considered “office work.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Public utilities, as contemplated
by CL Reg 3, include electric, natural gas, telecommunication (including
telephone), water, and transportation services.  </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33c23. Construction.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>29
CFR 570.33(n)(4) prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in
occupations in connection with construction, including demolition and repair,
except such minors may perform office work and sales work for such employers as
long as the work is not performed on trains, motor vehicles, aircraft, vessels,
or other media of transportation or at the actual site of construction
operations.</p>

<h3>33d00  . General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
In accordance with FLSA § 3(l),
nonexempt 14- and 15-year-olds may only be employed in those nonagricultural
occupations that the Secretary of Labor has determined do not interfere with
their health and well-being.  Occupations that are not specifically listed as
permitted are prohibited (see § 570.32).  Such youth must also be employed
in compliance with the hours standards established by § 570.35.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
29 CFR 570.34 lists those jobs
that the Secretary of Labor has determined do not interfere with the health and
well-being of 14- and 15-year-olds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  29 CFR 570.33 details occupations in which 14- and
15-year-olds generally may not be employed.  This list is not exhaustive, but
reflects some of the more common areas of violation.  This list is provided to
add clarity to the list of permitted occupations detailed in 29 CFR 570.34.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Prior to July 19, 2010, the effective date of the 2010
Final Rule, the nonagricultural employment of 14- and 15-year-olds was
generally limited to retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments,
or in departments or discrete portions of the premises devoted to retailing,
food service, or gasoline service in other establishments.  The Final Rule
eliminated those limitations, thus expanding employment opportunities for this
age group into additional industries such as state and local government,
wholesale establishments, medical offices, and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The order in which the CL Reg 3
Occupational Standards are presented in this Chapter follow, as nearly as
possible, the order in which each standard is presented or touched upon in
29 CFR 570.33 and 570.34.  In general, FOH 33(d) discusses the
permitted occupations (see § 570.34) and the list of prohibited
occupations are discussed in FOH 33(c) (see § 570.33).  Because
§§ 570.33 and 570.34 tend to reinforce and provide clarity to each other,
considerable overlap between FOH 33c and 33d is to be expected.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33d01  . Office and clerical work, including the operation of office
machines.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.34(a) permits 14- and
15-year-olds to be employed to perform office and clerical work, including the
operation of office machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Office work includes such tasks as
filing, typing, data processing, computer programming, answering the telephone,
and bookkeeping in an office setting; the cleaning and dusting of an office are
considered “office work” and are permitted under CL Reg 3 for minors 14- and 15
years of age.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>(c)   </b><b>Paper shredders</b>. 
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may operate office-type paper shredders in an office
setting as part of “office work.”  CL Reg 3 would prevent such youth from
operating paper shredders in an industrial or recycling setting. </p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>33d02. Work of an intellectual or artistically creative nature.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.34(b) permits 14- and
15-year-olds to be employed to perform work of an intellectual or artistically
creative nature.  Such employment is permitted in any industry other than those
prohibited by CL Reg. 3 and is also subject to all the applicable time
standards established in § 570.35 and the prohibited occupation standards
contained in § 570.33.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Permitted work of an intellectual
nature includes, but is not limited to, such tasks as computer programming, the
writing of software, teaching or performing as a tutor, and serving as a peer
counselor or teacher’s assistant.  Such work is limited to work that is similar
to that performed in an office setting and may not involve the use of any
power-driven equipment other than those permitted by § 570.34.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Artistically creative work is
confined to work in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavors as
discussed in 29 CFR 541.302(b) (see 75 FR 28417).  This section limits the
scope of artistically creative endeavors to such fields as music, writing,
acting, and the graphic arts.  Under this provision, 14- and 15-year-olds are
permitted to be employed in such occupations as musicians, singers, artists,
runway models, and church musical directors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds who are employed in
artistically creative endeavors will continue to be prohibited from performing
any of the occupations or tasks detailed in the revised § 570.33.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  These prohibitions include work in manufacturing and
processing occupations, the operation of most power-driven equipment, and any
duties in work rooms or work places where goods are manufactured or processed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
These prohibitions would prevent a
14- or 15-year-old from working in a factory or workroom as a “molder” or “hand
painter” producing mass quantities of nearly identical pottery or ceramic
items, but would permit the youth to express his or her artistic talents in a
potter studio to shape by hand a unique clay pot or sculpt a piece of art.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Likewise, a 14- or 15-year-old
could be employed, with all the safeguards of §§ 570.33-.35, as a painter
of portraits but not as a painter of automobiles or houses.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Similarly, a youth could be
employed to create unique photographs that rise to the level of art, but would
be prevented from developing those photographs and working with the chemicals
and solvents commonly used in such processing activities.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
WH stated in the Preamble to the
2010 Final Rule in response to a specific question that the Department of Labor
does not consider tattooing or body piercing to be artistically creative
endeavors under the provisions of either § 570.34(b) or § 541.302(b)
(see 75 FR 28417).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>e.     </b>In addition, the hours standards provisions of §
570.35 restrict the number of hours and times of day that 14- and 15-year-olds
may be employed in any FLSA-covered work, including artistically creative
endeavors.  </p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>33d03  . Permitted cooking duties.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.33(h) generally
prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from performing any cooking except that which is
permitted by § 570.34(c).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
29 CFR 570.34(c) permits 14- and
15-year-olds to cook with the following equipment:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Gas grills that do not involve cooking over an open
flame, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Deep fryers that are equipped with and utilize a
device which automatically lowers the baskets into the hot oil or grease and
automatically raises the baskets from the hot oil or grease.  The regulations
require that the product being deep fried be contained in a “basket” during the
frying process.  Therefore, 14- and 15-year-olds could not be employed to deep
fry products that are placed into and removed from the hot fat or grease via
some other utensil (tongs, fork, stick, etc.).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
29 C CFR 570.34(c) also
specifically mentions that such minors may not cook with such equipment as
rotisseries, broilers, pressurized equipment including fryolators, and cooking
devices that operate at extremely high temperatures such as “Neico broilers.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
The rules concerning prohibited
cooking duties are discussed in FOH 33c11.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
The rules concerning the cleaning
of kitchen equipment by 14- and 15-year-olds are discussed in
FOH 33c05(b)(1).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)  
The rules concerning the operation
of power-driven kitchen equipment are discussed in FOH 33c12.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33d04  . Kitchen work, including the preparing and serving of food and
beverages, and the  cleaning of kitchen equipment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and
15-year-olds to perform certain work involved with the preparing and serving of
food and beverages, including the operation of certain machines and devices.  A
list of permitted kitchen equipment and devices is provided in
FOH 33c12(a).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and
15-year-olds to operate devices used to maintain the temperature of prepared
foods such as warmers, steam tables, and heat lamps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and
15-year-olds to operate microwave ovens that are used only to warm prepared
food and do not have the capacity to warm above 140 °F.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
29 CFR 570.34(j) permits 14- and
15-year-olds to clean vegetables and fruit.  This same section also permits
such youth to wrap, seal, label, weigh, price, and stock items, including
vegetables, fruits, and meats, when performed in areas physically separate from
a freezer or meat cooler.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>(e)  </b>29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and 15-year-olds to clean kitchen
equipment (not otherwise prohibited), remove oil or grease filters, pour oil or
grease through filters, and move receptacles containing hot grease or hot oil
but only when the equipment, surfaces, containers, and liquids do not exceed a
temperature of 100 °F.  See FOH 33c05(b)(1) for a detailed discussion about the
cleaning of kitchen equipment and surfaces.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<h3>33d05  . Loading and unloading of certain items onto and from motor
vehicles.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Although <a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1">29 CFR 570.33(k)</a> generally prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds
from loading goods or property onto or from motor vehicles, that section notes
that § 570.34(k) does allow such youth to perform certain loading and unloading
duties.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
29 CFR 570.34(k) permits 14- and
15-year-olds to load and unload, onto and from motor vehicles, those light,
non-power-driven hand tools and personal protective equipment that the minor
will use as part of his or her employment at the work site.  They may also load
and unload personal items such as back packs, lunch boxes, or coats that their
employers allow them to take to the work site.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Such light tools include, but are not limited to,
rakes, hand-held clippers, shovels, and brooms.  Such light tools do not
include items like trash, sales kits, promotion items or items for sale, lawn
mowers, or other power-driven equipment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Such minors are not permitted to load or unload safety
equipment such as barriers, cones, or signage. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33d06  . Lifeguards.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
29 CFR 570.34(l) permits
15-year-olds, but not 14-year-olds, to be employed to perform lifeguard duties
at traditional swimming pools and water amusement parks when such youth have
been trained and certified by the American Red Cross, or a similar certifying
organization, in aquatics and water safety.  Section 570.34(l) was incorporated
into the Regulation by the 2008 Final Rule and replaces an enforcement position
previously adopted by WH.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The core and defining duty of a lifeguard is to rescue
swimmers in danger of drowning, often by entering the water and physically
bringing the swimmer to safety (see 75 FR 28418).  CL Reg. 3 now prohibits the
employment of anyone under 15 years of age to perform this core duty; and
15-year-olds may do so only when properly certified. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Any employee under the age of 16 whose duties include
this core duty—such as a “junior lifeguard” or a “swim teacher aide”—or whose
employment could place him or her in a situation where the employer would
reasonably expect him or her to perform such rescue duties, would be performing
the duties of a lifeguard while working is such a position.  For such
employment to comply with CL Reg. 3, the employee must be at least 15 years of
age and be properly certified.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  A 15-year-old who has been properly certified as a
lifeguard, may also serve as a swimming instructor, but only when he or she has
also been properly certified as a swimming instructor by the American Red Cross
or some other recognized certifying agency (see 29 CFR 570.34(l)(2)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Where 15-year-old lifeguards may
and may not be employed:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Traditional swimming pools  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Properly certified 15-year-old
lifeguards may be employed at traditional swimming pools.  A traditional
swimming pool means a water tight structure of concrete, masonry, or other
approved materials located either indoors or outdoors, used for bathing or
swimming and filled with a filtered and disinfected water supply, together with
buildings, appurtenances and equipment used in connection therewith. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The provisions of § 570.34(l)
apply irrespective of who owns, operates, or manages the pool.  Therefore, such
minors could be employed at hotel pools, apartment complex pools, and homeowner
association pools, as well as community pools.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Water amusement parks  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Properly certified 15-year-olds
may be employed as lifeguards at most facilities of a water amusement park.  A
water amusement park means an establishment that not only encompasses the
features of a traditional swimming pool, but also includes such additional attractions
as wave pools, lazy rivers, baby pools, activities areas,
and elevated water slides. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Fifteen- year-olds may serve as
lifeguards at the wave pools, the lazy rivers, the activities areas, the baby
pools, and at the receiving or splashdown areas of the elevated water slides.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may not
be stationed at the top of an elevated water slide to monitor the slide
operations, keep order, and serve as “dispatcher” to ensure patrons properly
ride the slide.  The general prohibition against operating or tending
power-driven equipment contained in CL Reg. 3 prohibits youth under 16 from
performing these “nontraditional” lifeguard duties at the top or on the stairs
of an elevated slide.  This same prohibition prevents youth under 16 from being
employed to operate or tend, or serve as “attendants” on, amusement park rides</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Natural environments.  No one under 16 years of age
may be employed as a lifeguard at rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, quarries,
reservoirs, wharfs, piers, canals, oceanside beaches, nor other natural
environments. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The duties 15-year-old lifeguards
may perform include the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Rescuing swimmers in danger of drowning,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Monitoring activities at poolside to prevent
accidents,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Providing swimming lessons, but only if properly
certified to do so (see FOH 33d06(e)(3)a below,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Teaching water safety,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Providing assistance to patrons,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Helping maintain order and cleanliness in the pool and
pool areas,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  Conducting and officiating at swim meets,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)  Administering first aid,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9)  Checking in and out items such as towels, and personal
items such as rings, watches, and apparel,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(10)  Using a ladder to access and descend from a lifeguard
chair,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(11)  Using hand tools to clean the pool and pool area, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(12)  Testing and recording water quality for temperature
and/or Ph levels, using all of the tools of the testing process including
adding chemicals to the test water sample.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
The duties 15-year-old lifeguards
may not perform include the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Such youth may not enter or work in any mechanical
room or chemical storage area, including any areas where the filtration and
chlorinating systems are housed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Such youth may not operate or tend any power-driven
equipment, including power-driven elevated water slides often found at water
amusement parks and some swimming pools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
CL Reg. 3 prohibits the employment
of youths under 16 years of age as dispatchers or attendants at the top of
elevated water slides performing such tasks as maintaining order, directing
patrons as to when to depart the top of the slide, and ensuring that patrons
have begun their “ride” safely (see § 570.34(l)(2)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Properly certified 15-year-old
lifeguards may be stationed at the “splashdown pools” at the bottom of the
elevated water slides to perform those permitted duties listed in FOH 33d06(b)
above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The prohibition concerning tending
power-driven water slides would not apply to those small water slides designed
for use by very small children and often located in “baby pools.”  These slides
normally rise no more than five or ten feet are accessed by ramps that patrons
walk up rather than stairways or ladders.  Properly certified 15-year-old
lifeguards may tend these little slides designed for very small children.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
Certification</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  29 CFR 570.34(l) requires that 15-year-olds be trained
and certified in water safety and aquatics by the American Red Cross or a
similar certifying agency, before they may be employed as lifeguards or to
perform the core duties of a lifeguard as discussed in FOH 33d06(a)(1) above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Normally, the youth will have in his or her custody a
certificate documenting that he or she has successfully completed all classroom
and practical skill sets necessary for certification as a lifeguard.  Such
certification will normally be sufficient for purposes of establishing
compliance with this portion of CL Reg. 3.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  As per § 570.34(l)(2), 15-year-olds who, as part of
their employment, serve as swimming instructors—teaching others how to
swim—must not only hold proper certification as a lifeguard, but must also be
certified as a swimming instructor by the American Red Cross or some other
recognized certifying organization.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Once a lifeguard turns 16 years of age, this dual
requirement for certification, just as all the other provisions of CL Reg. 3,
end. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  WH has determined that the following organizations
offer lifeguard certification programs that are similar to that offered by the
American Red Cross and therefore satisfy the requirements of § 570.34(l).  This
list is not to be considered exhaustive.</p>

<h3>33e00  . Employment by parents, FLSA § 3(l).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Nonagricultural employment</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  FLSA § 3(l) exempts from the definition of “oppressive
child labor,” and thus from FLSA § 12 coverage, employment by parents or
persons standing in place of parents of their own child or a child in their
custody, provided that the minor, if 16 or 17 years of age, is not employed in
an occupation covered by a non-agricultural HO.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
If the minor is under 16 years of
age, he or she may not be employed in an actual manufacturing or mining
occupation, or in an occupation covered by a non-agricultural HO.  Such minors
under 16 years of age may be employed in processing occupations or in a
manufacturing work room, if not employed in an actual manufacturing occupation
or in an occupation declared to be hazardous. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
If the minor is under 16 years of
age, the CL Reg. 3 hours standards would not apply to the youth when he or she
was employed by a business owned by his or her parent or a person standing in
place of his or her parent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The exemption applies only when the parent is the sole
employer of the minor.  If the parent is a partner in a partnership or an
officer of a corporation the parental exemption does not apply unless the
parents are the only members of the partnership or the sole owners of the
corporation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The parental exemption in the FLSA was included to permit
children to be employed in some occupations by their parents on the basis that
a parent’s natural concern for his or her child’s well-being would serve to
protect the child.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Application of this exemption is limited to the
employment of children exclusively by their parents.  Any other applications
would render the safeguard mentioned above ineffective.  The sole owner of a
business is in a position to regulate the duties of his or her child and
provide guidance.  Where the ownership of the corporation or partnership is
vested in persons other than the parent, the child is responsible to persons
other than his or her parent – his or her duties are regulated by the
corporation or partnership.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Reserved</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33e01. Employment as actors or performers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>FLSA
§ 13(c)(3) provides an exemption from § 12 for employment as an actor or
performer in motion pictures or theatrical, radio, or television productions.
Minors employed as performers in a circus also fall within this exemption.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33e02. Newspaper delivery employees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>FLSA
§ 13(d) provides an exemption from FLSA §§ 6, 7, and 12 for any employee
engaged in the delivery of newspapers to the consumer (see
FOH Chapter 23).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33e03. Homeworkers making wreaths.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>FLSA
§ 13(d) provides an exemption from FLSA §§ 6, 7, and 12 for homeworkers engaged
in the making of wreaths composed principally of natural holly, pine, cedar, or
other evergreens (include the harvesting of the evergreens or other forest
products used in making such wreaths) (see FOH Chapter 25).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33e04. Loading of certain balers and compactors by 16- and 17-year-olds.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>FLSA
§ 13(c)(5) provides for an exemption from the child labor provisions for the
employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not operate or unload, certain
power-driven scrap paper balers and paper box compactors under certain
conditions (see FOH 33h12(d)(2)). </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33e05. Limited driving of certain automobiles and trucks by
17-year-olds.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>FLSA
§ 13(c)(6) provides an exemption for 17-year-olds, but not 16-year-olds, who,
as part of their employment, perform the occasional and incidental driving of
automobiles and trucks on public highways under specified conditions (see
FOH 33h02(d)(2)).  </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33e06. Employment of certain youth inside and outside of places of
business that use power-</h3>
<h4><b>driven machinery to process wood products. </b></h4>
<p> </p>
<p>FLSA
§ 13(c)(7) provides a limited exemption from the child labor provisions for
certain youth between the ages of 14 and 18 years who, by statute or judicial
order, are excused from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade,
that permits their employment inside and outside of places of business that use
power-driven machinery to process wood products.  Although the exemption allows
certain youth between the ages of 14 and 18 years to be employed inside and
outside of places of business that use power-driven machines to process wood
products, it does so only if such youth do not operate or assist in the
operation of power-driven woodworking machines (see FOH 33c01(a)
and 33h04(d)(2)).  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds whose employment falls under the
§ 13(c)(7) exemption may be employed during school hours (see
FOH 33b02(b)(1)b), but are still subject to the other hours and occupation
standards established by CL Reg 3.</p>

<h3>33f00.  Outside of school hours. [Rev. 599, 12/28/93]</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Section 13(c) provides that Sec 12
will apply to minors under 16 years of age employed in hazardous occupations in
agriculture unless employed by a parent or person standing in the place of a
parent.  (See FOH 33f03.)  Thus, the exemption for minors below the age of 16
employed in agriculture outside of school hours is limited to occupations which
have not been declared hazardous.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The definition of “agriculture” in
Sec 3(f) determines whether an employee is “employed in agriculture” for
purposes of Sec 13(c)(1) or (2), regardless of whether or not the employment is
subject to the (6)(a)(5) MW.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The term “outside of school hours”
refers to the hours before and after school, holidays, Saturday, Sunday,
vacation time, and any day when the school in the district where the minor is
living is not in session. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33f01.  Children who move into another area.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>WH
has taken the enforcement position that children who leave one district where
schools have closed for summer vacation and move into and live in another district
where schools are still in session may work during the hours schools are in
session in this new district. This position applies only during the spring of
the year. In order to ensure compliance, employers should verify that the
school the minor previously attended has closed for summer vacation.  </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33f02. Minimum age during school hours.</h3>
<p>[Rev. 599, 12/28/93]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The minimum age is 16 for
employment in agriculture during school hours unless: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The minor is employed exclusively by his or her parent
or by a person standing in the place of his or her parent. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The minor has completed his or her high school course.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The minor is below the eligible entrance age in the
state. In states where there is no written eligible age, the compulsory age
becomes the eligible age. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The school, which the minor normally attends or would
normally attend in the district where he or she is living, is closed for crop
vacation or any other reason. In some communities, one school may close for
crop vacation while others in the same community remain in session.  The Inv
will need to find out which public or parochial school the minor attends and in
the case of the migrant minor, which public school he or she would normally
attend. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  The school, due to crowded conditions, is operating on
a split shift basis.  Under this plan the school day is divided into half-day
sessions.  Some children attend classes in the morning and others in the
afternoon.  The children under these circumstances could be legally employed in
agriculture the half-day they are not required to attend school. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  The administrative unit, such as the high school or
junior high school which the minor attends, is closed. The exemption makes no
provision for the release of individual children or any class or grade to work
in agriculture. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Minors below 16 years of age may
not be employed in AG H.O.s except where employed by a parent or person
standing in the place of a parent on a farm owned or operated by the parent or
person standing in place thereof (see FOH 33f03). Thus, the
employment during school hours of minors under 16 years of age under the
conditions set forth in FOH 33f02(a)(2) through (6) above is permitted only
where the minor does not engage in such hazardous work.  </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33f03.    HOs—agriculture (Ag H.O.s). [Rev. 599, 12/28/93]</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Section 13(c)(2) reads as follows:
“The provisions of section 12 of this title relating to child labor shall apply
to an employee below the age of sixteen employed in agriculture in an
occupation that the Secretary of Labor finds and declares to be particularly
hazardous for the employment of children below the age of 16, except where such
employee is employed by his parent or by a person standing in the place of his
parent on a farm owned or operated by such parent or person.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The 16-year minimum age for
agricultural employment in occupations declared to be hazardous applies to
covered agricultural employment which meets the definition given in Sec 3(f)
and without regard to whether or not such employment is subject to the MW
provided by Sec 6(a)(5). The 16-year minimum age does not depend upon whether
or not the employment is “outside school hours.” Thus, the 16-year minimum age
for such hazardous occupations applies during vacation periods as well as hours
before and after school or on nonschool days. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
The parental exemption from the Ag
H.O.s in Sec 13(c)(2) from the HO/A applies to the minor’s natural parent or to
a “person standing in the place of his parent”, as long as the employment is on
a farm owned or operated by such parent or person. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Owned by the parent or person
standing in the place of the parent includes part ownership as a partner in a
partnership or as an officer of a corporation which owns the farm if the
ownership interest in the partnership or corporation is substantial. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
Operated by the parent or person standing in the place of the
parent means that the person exerts active and direct control over the
operation of the farm or ranch by making day-to-day decisions affecting basic
income, assigning work, hiring and firing employees and exercising direct
supervision of the farm or ranch work. Ranch managers, therefore, who meet
these criteria could employ his or her own children under 16 on the ranch they
operate without regard to the provisions of the HO/A. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)  
The 18-year minimum age set by the
17 nonagricultural HOs (see FOH 33h), does not apply to an
employee employed in “agriculture” as defined in § 3(f). For example, if a
minor under 18 is employed in agriculture and works as a driver on a motor
vehicle, HO 2 does not apply even though the minor may go “in or about” a
producing establishment to deliver the farmer’s products.  On the other hand,
if the minor’s employment does not meet the tests in Sec 3(f), HO 2 would apply
in the normal manner.  If a minor under 16 is employed in agriculture as
defined in Sec 3(f), he or she is subject only to the hazardous occupation
orders in agriculture set forth in (g) below. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)  
The following
occupations in agriculture have been declared hazardous by the Secretary of
Labor for the employment of minors under 16 years of age: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Operating a tractor of
over 20 PTO (power takeoff) horsepower, or connecting or disconnecting an
implement or any of its parts to or from such a tractor: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Farm tractors overturn
easily and the operator or passenger may be seriously injured. Serious injuries
are complicated if the accident occurs in an isolated area and is not
discovered quickly. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The rotating drive
mechanisms of implements or power takeoff drives inflict serious injuries if
parts of the body or clothing come in contact with the exposed driveshaft or
moving parts. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Persons under 16 may
operate garden-type tractors. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) 
Operating or assisting
to operate (including starting, stopping, adjusting, feeding, or any other
activity involving physical contact associated with the operation) any of the
following machines: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Corn picker, cotton
picker, grain combine, hay mower, forage harvester, hay baler, potato digger,
or mobile pea viner. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
These machines use
rotary gears, revolving shafts, driving chains, belts, augers, conveyor belts
and chains, knives, blowers, levers, and hydraulic pistons to grasp, cut,
pound, grind, convey, compress, push, or pull material. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
The farm worker
sometimes comes in contact with the moving parts and is seriously injured when
he or she tries to unclog, repair, or adjust the machine when the motor is
running. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Feed grinder, crop
dryer, forage blower, auger conveyor, or the unloading mechanism of a
nongravity-type self loading wagon or trailer. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
These machines, except
for some that are fed manually, are similar in construction and operation to
those described above, and involve the same hazards. There is an additional
danger that if a part of the body is caught by a turning auger, amputation is
almost unavoidable. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.  
Persons under 16 may
move the crop to the person feeding the machine and remove the finished product
from the area; they may load and unload material from other types of conveyors,
such as belt, bucket, or chain. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.  
The unloading of a
bulk body truck, including machines with self-unloading bulk boxes, meets the
description of this Ag H.O. and is prohibited for minors under age 16. However,
the operation of a potato bin piler is permitted for minors under 16 years of age
working on farms. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Power post-hole
digger, power post-driver, or nonwalking type rotary tiller. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
The hazard of the
post-hole digger is the danger of becoming entangled with the rotating drive.
The hazard with the power post-hole driver, is a possibility of being struck by
the descending ram. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
Persons under 16 may
set posts in holes, tamp the earth, attach and stretch wire, install gates, and
repair fences. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) 
Operating or assisting
to operate (including starting, stopping, adjusting, feeding, or any other
activity involving physical contact associated with the operation) any of the
following machines: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Trencher or
earthmoving equipment. The hazards of earthmoving or trenching equipment are
entanglement with moving parts and falling under a moving piece of equipment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Forklift. Forklifts
have a double hazard of falling loads and overturning. They also accidentally
may be driven over the edge of platforms. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.  
Potato combine </p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.  
Power-driven circular,
band, or chain saw. The chief hazards in connection with saws are the danger of
amputation and severe cuts from contact with the cutting edge. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) 
Working on a farm in a
yard, pen, or stall occupied by a bull, boar, or stud horse maintained for
breeding purposes or a sow with suckling pigs, or cow with newborn calf (with
umbilical cord present): </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Handling these animals
requires experience, skill, and strength. If they attack without warning,
escape is especially difficult from confined areas. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
This section does not
prohibit work with these or any animals in an open area. It does not prohibit
work with beef or range bulls and cattle, dairy cattle, or breeding stock on
the range. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5) 
Felling, bucking,
skidding, loading, or unloading timber with butt diameter of more than 6
inches: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Workers
under 16 are still permitted to work with timber up to 6 inches in diameter,
which includes most fence posts and tier poles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Working from a ladder or scaffold (painting,
repairing, or building structures, pruning trees, picking fruit, etc., at a
height of over twenty feet:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Many severe injuries occur when
work is done from a ladder or scaffold at a considerable height.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
This section does not prohibit
using ladders to reach a work site above twenty feet, as long as the work is
not done from a ladder or scaffold.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  Driving a bus, truck, or automobile when transporting
passengers, or riding on a tractor as a passenger or helper:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Exposure to traffic while moving
at considerable speed makes driving a motor vehicle on a public road or highway
hazardous.  The additional responsibility of carrying passengers makes such
driving unsuitable for minors under 16 years of age.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
In addition, most states will not
issue a driver’s license for a youth under 16 years of age.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Minors under 16 may drive a truck
or automobile on the farm itself.  However, they may not ride on any tractor or
serve as a helper on any tractor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)  Working inside:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
A fruit, forage, or grain storage
designed to retain an oxygen deficient or toxic atmosphere,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
An upright silo within two weeks
after silage has been added or when a top unloading device is in operating
position,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
A manure pit, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
A horizontal silo while operating
a tractor for packing purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
When oxygen is replaced by another
gas or consumed by fermentation, anyone entering these storage areas is in
danger of asphyxiation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
If the top unloading device is in
operating position in the silo, a person may become entangled in its cutting
and tearing mechanism and be seriously injured.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
Employees under 16 may work inside
the non-gas-tight type silo while the unloading device is in a raised position,
and they may also operate this device from outside the silo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.    
The hazard involved in operating a
tractor for packing purposes in a horizontal silo is the danger of overturning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9)  Handling or applying (including cleaning or
decontaminating equipment, disposal or return of empty containers, or serving a
s flagman for aircraft applying) agricultural chemicals classified under the
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 135 et seq.)
as Category I of toxicity, identified by the word “poison” and the “skull
and crossbones” on the label or Category II of toxicity, identified by the word
“warning” on the label:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Many agricultural chemicals
present serious health hazards.  Some have a corrosive effect on body tissue. 
Some affect the central nervous system, causing respiratory failures and many
cause death by the accumulation of even minute quantities over a prolonged
period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The hazards involved in the job of
flagman are that the employee must stand in the line of the flight to direct
the pilot and also because of the possibility of contamination from the
chemicals being applied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Minors under 16 may handle and
apply fertilizers or chemicals that are not labeled as indicated by this AG H.O.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(10)  Handling or using a blasting agent, including but not
limited to, dynamite, black powder, sensitized ammonium nitrate, blasting caps,
and primer cord:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
use of blasting agents requires experience and expertise.  Mishandling can
result in accidental detonation, maiming, or loss of life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(11)  Transporting, transferring, or applying anhydrous
ammonia:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Vapors
are very irritating to the eyes and to the respiratory system.  In case of
contact with the skin, it may result in severe burns.  Too high a concentration
of vapors could cause suffocation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The following are some examples of
work activities not affected by the Ag H.O.s.:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Handling chemical pesticides and fertilizers not
included in Item (9) above,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Driving a truck, automobile, or bus on the farm proper
and serving as helpers on such vehicles,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Loading and unloading trucks,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Operating garden-type tractors,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Picking vegetables and berries, and placing them on
conveyors or in containers,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Clearing brush and harvesting trees up to 6 inches in
butt diameter,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  Working from ladders at heights less than 20 feet,
such as picking of most fruits</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)  Working with farm animals, except work with certain breeding
stock in confined areas, including showing any animal at livestock shows,
fairs, exhibits, or similar activities when not taking place on a farm,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9)  Hand planting and cultivation,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(10)  Raising and caring for poultry,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(11)  Milking cows,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(12)  Processing and storing milk and dairy products,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(13)  Cleaning barns, equipment storage buildings, chicken
coops, etc.,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(14)  Mowing lawns,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(15)  Riding, driving, or exercising horses,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(16)  Picking cotton,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(17)  Handling of irrigation pipes,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(18)  Harvesting and storing tobacco,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(19)  Riding on transplanters.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33f04.   Educational and/or Training Programs providing exemptions from
certain provisions of the Ag H.O.s.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Student-learner exemptions (see
29 CFR 570.72(a))</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  This exemption applies to minors 14 and 15 years of
age.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  This exemption only applies to the tasks listed in
FOH 33d03(g)(1) through and including § 33d03(g)(6) (see also
29 CFR 570.71(a)(1)-(6)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The application of this exemption is not limited to
the school term but also applies in the summer vacation provided all the terms
of the exemption are met.  The necessary “direct and close” supervision during
the summer months is ordinarily provided by a vocational agricultural teacher
employed on a 12-month basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Federal Extension Service
Exemption</b> (see 29 CFR
570.72(b))</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Any minor who is 14 or 15 years of age may enroll in
the tractor training course and/or the farm machinery training course set up by
the local County Agricultural Extension Agent as part of the 4-H Club program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Upon successful completion of the training course(s),
he or she will be permitted to work in those occupations identified in
FOH 33d03(g)(1) and 33d03(g)(2) for which he or she has been trained (see
also 29 CFR 570.71(a)(1)-(2)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Minors may be identified by showing their copy of the
“Certificate of Training.”  The employer is also required to keep a copy of the
certificate on file.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Vocational Agriculture Training
Exemption</b> (see 29 CFR
570.71(c))</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Any minors 14 and 15 years of age enrolled in
cooperative vocational agriculture training programs who take and successfully
complete courses provided by local vocational agriculture teachers on the safe
use of tractors and farm machinery will be permitted to be employed in those
occupations identified in FOH 33d03(g)(1) and 33d03(g)(2) (see also 29
CFR 570.71(a)(1)-(2)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Minors may be identified by showing their copy of the
“Certificate of Training.”  The employer is also required to keep a copy of the
certificate on file.</p>

<h3>33g00.   General discussion.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Section 3(l) of the FLSA, which
defines “oppressive child labor,” prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from
performing those occupations which the Secretary of Labor finds and declares to
be particularly hazardous for the employment of children between such ages or
detrimental to their health or well-being.  Under this authority, the Secretary
has issued 17 Hazardous Occupations Orders (HOs).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The HOs specifically cover 16- and
17-year-old minors.  But minors under 16 years of age are also banned from
performing any of the occupations prohibited by the HOs because of CL Reg 3 (see
29 CFR 570.33(b)).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33g01. How HOs are created.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
All the HOs were originally issued
between 1939 and 1963.  The first six HOs were issued by the now defunct
Children's Bureau.  Reorganization Plan No. 2 transferred the authority to
issue HOs to the Division of Labor Standards, effective July 16, 1946.  HOs 7
through 17 were issued by the Child Labor and Youth Employment Branch of the
Division of Labor Standards or its successor agencies, often with technical
help from either the Division of Safety Standards or experts in the industry
being studied.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The process used to issue the original HOs consisted
of conducting an investigation (study) of an industry, process, or machinery
considered to be dangerous for young employees.  Hearings would often be held
and a committee of interested parties would often be convened to make
recommendations.  The process culminated with the issuance of a report that detailed
the hazards involved and actually presented the HO.  The reports established
the range and scope of each HO, coverage, and any exclusions and exemptions.
These reports still remain the basis for opinions issued under each of the
original HOs, although subsequent amendments to the HOs have expanded their
scope.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Recent changes to individual HOs have resulted from
such things as legislation, stakeholder input, academic studies, and WHD
enforcement experiences.  Detailed information concerning these changes are
provided in the preambles of the Federal Register publications issued during
rulemaking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
The procedure used to establish
the HOs (found in Child Labor Regulation No. 5, previously incorporated in
subpart D of 29 CFR 570.41 through 570.49) preceded the enactment of the
Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  On April 17, 1995, the Department
published a notice in the Federal Register (60 FR 19336), which
deleted subpart D; consequently, any amendments to existing HOs or creation of
new HOs must now follow the procedures established by the APA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33g02.   The effect of the 1961 and 1966 FLSA Amendments on HOs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
HOs, with the exception of HO 16 and HO 17, were issued before enactment of the
1961 and 1966 FLSA Amendments which brought many previously uncovered
establishments under the provisions of the Act (retail, construction, state and
local governments).  Most of the original reports establishing the HOs did not
address retail operations because of the limited FLSA coverage, however, many
of the HOs have since been amended to address their application to retail
operations. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33g03  . Industry, process-oriented, or machine-specific HOs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Certain HOs apply to whole
industries or processes.  These include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO
1 — Manufacturing or Storing of Explosives,</p>
<p>HO
3 — Coal Mining,</p>
<p>HO 4 — Forest Fire Fighting and Fire Prevention,
Timber Tract and Forestry Service Occupations, and Logging and Sawmilling
Operations,</p>
<p>HO
9 — Mining other than Coal Mining,</p>
<p>HO
10—Slaughtering, Meat and Poultry Packing, Processing, or Rendering,</p>
<p>HO
13—Manufacturing Brick, Tile, and Kindred Products, </p>
<p>HO
15—Wrecking, Demolition and Shipbreaking Operations,</p>
<p>HO
16—Roofing Operations and on or about a Roof, and </p>
<p>HO
17—Excavation Operations.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Generally,
most of the work in the named industry or process is prohibited—with a few
exceptions—such as office or maintenance work performed outside of the production
area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Other HOs address only families of
machines or specific acts.  In some instances, many machines common to an
industry are prohibited.  These include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO
2  —Motor Vehicle Occupations,</p>
<p>HO
5  —Power-Driven Woodworking Machines,</p>
<p>HO
6  —Exposure to Radioactive Substances and Ionizing Radiation, and</p>
<p>HO
12—Balers, Compactors, and Power-Driven Paper Products Machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Other HOs prohibit only those
machines that specifically are named as being dangerous.  These include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO
7  —Power-Driven Hoisting Apparatus,</p>
<p>HO
8  —Power-Driven Metal Forming, Punching and Shearing Machines,</p>
<p>HO
11—Power-Driven Bakery Machines, and</p>
<p>HO
14—Power-Driven Circular Saws, Band Saws, Guillotine Shears, Chain Saws; Reciprocating
Saws, Wood Chippers, and Abrasive Cutting Discs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   A few of the HO
prohibitions are so broad in scope that they include not only the machines used
in the industry at the time the report was issued but any similar machines
developed after the issuance of the HO.  For example, the ban on woodworking machines
(HO 5) includes all computerized woodworking machines, and the ban on high-lift
trucks (HO 7) includes all types and uses of such trucks, whether specifically
identified or not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   There are separate
Hazardous Occupations Orders covering agricultural work (AG H.O.) which prohibit
minors under age 16 from performing certain tasks on farms.  These are
discussed and defined in subpart E-1 of 29 CFR part 570.  Agricultural work
activities must be separated from nonagricultural activities so that the appropriate
child labor standard is applied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   In order to reduce
confusion, the scope of each HO is discussed separately in the sections
covering the individual HOs (see FOH 33g05 and 33h).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33g04.   Special purposes of HO 14.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
The report establishing HO 14 considered
the general safety of work associated with circular saws, band saws and
guillotine shears.  The report found that the operation of this equipment is
hazardous wherever used, and that setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and
cleaning of these machines are also hazardous.  This led WH to review the scope
of other HOs and it was determined that only HO 5 specifically prohibited
these ancillary activities. Accordingly, HOs 8, 10, 11 and 12 were revised to
prohibit minors from setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and cleaning the
machines prohibited by those HOs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
HO 14 serves as a “catch-all” HO. 
It prohibits minors from operating circular saws, band saws guillotine shears,
chain saws, wood chippers, abrasive cutting discs, and reciprocating saws in
any employment situation where this machinery is not prohibited by any of the
other HOs.  This is discussed further in the Scope of HO 14 (see
FOH 33h14(a)).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33g05.  HOs are mutually exclusive.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The
HOs are designed to be mutually exclusive.  Certain machines, however, may fall
under different HOs at different times because their functions can vary, as
when different attachments are used.  For example, a dough mixer prohibited
under HO 11 would be prohibited under HO 10 if a meat grinding attachment were
added to make hamburger.  Likewise, there may be situations when the illegal
employment of a youth will fall under several HOs (e.g., the employment of a
16-year-old youth in a coal mine, while using a circular saw, would constitute
a violation of HO 3 and HO 14).  </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33g06.   Apprentices and student-learners.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
HOs 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17
contain limited exemptions for apprentices and student-learners provided they
are employed under certain conditions (see 29 CFR 570.50).  None
of these limited exemptions, however, permit apprentices or student-learners to
drive motor-vehicles as part of their training programs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Apprentices</b>.  The provisions of the HOs listed in (a) above do
not apply to the employment of apprentices provided:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  the apprentice is employed in a craft recognized as an
apprenticeable trade (the Office of Apprenticeship (OA), part of the Employment
Training Administration can provide guidance),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  the work of the apprentice in the hazardous occupation
is incidental to the apprentice training, is intermittent and for short periods
of time, and under the direct and close supervision of a journey worker, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  the apprentice is registered by OA (or a state agency
approved by OA) or is employed under a written apprenticeship agreement which
conforms to federal or state standards as determined by the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>(c)  
</b><b>Student-Learners </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The provisions of the HOs listed in (a) above do not
apply to the employment of a student-learner enrolled in a course of study and
training in a cooperative vocational training program under a recognized state
or local educational authority or in a course of study in a substantially
similar program conducted by a private school, provided that the student-learner
is employed under a written agreement which provides:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
That the work of the
student-learner in the occupation declared particularly hazardous shall be
incidental to the training,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
That such work shall be
intermittent and for short periods of time, and under the direct and close
supervision of a qualified and experienced person,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
That safety instruction shall be
given by the school and correlated by the employer with on-the-job training,
and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
That a schedule of organized and
progressive work processes to be performed on the job shall have been prepared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The student-learner discussed in this section can be
(and usually is) different from those student-learners for whom an employer may
obtain a certificate to pay a subminimum wage under 29 CFR part 520.  An
employer does not have to obtain the special certificate that allows him or her
to employ student-learners at wages less than the minimum wage in order to take
advantage of this limited exemption from certain HOs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  WH considers a Jobs Corps training program to be
equivalent to “a course of study in a substantially similar program conducted
by a private school” under 29 CFR 570.50(c)(1) and employers of Job
Corps enrollees could take advantage of the limited exemption for
student-learners if all the other conditions listed
in 29 CFR 570.50(c) are met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  A high school graduate may be employed in an
occupation in which he or she has successfully completed training as a
student-learner without the restrictions imposed by 29 CFR 570.50(c)(1)
and (2), even though he or she is not yet 18 years of age.  Such minors must be
employed in compliance with the all the remaining child labor provisions (the
remaining HOs that do not have student learner exemptions).  Merely graduating
from high school is not sufficient to trigger this limited exemption from the
student-learner provisions; the minor must also have successfully completed the
appropriate vocational training.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5) 
The
student-learner exemption is not limited to the school term but applies during
the summer vacation provided all the terms of the exemption are met (see
29 CFR 570.50(c)).  The required “direct and close supervision” and
safety instructions will ordinarily be provided by the coordinator or an
appropriate school official during the summer months.  It is also necessary to
establish that the student  plans to be enrolled in a bona fide vocational
education program the term following the vacation period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
The following
definitions, applicable to the limited exemption from certain HOs, were
discussed in detail in the preamble of the April 17, 2007 Advance Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking (see 72 FR 19328,
19332).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
The terms intermittent
and short periods of time are not defined in the regulations and determinations
concerning the employment of each apprentice and student-learner are made on a
case-by-case basis after reviewing all the facts of the particular situation. 
The following items will be considered when making such determinations:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
An apprentice or
student-learner may not be the principal operator of prohibited machinery.  He
or she must work under the close supervision of a fully qualified and
experienced adult, such as a journey-level worker in the case of an apprentice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The duties assigned
the minor may not be such that he or she is constantly operating the prohibited
machinery during the work shift, but may only do so when required by the
training experience.  This precludes an apprentice or student-learner from
being a production worker responsible for spending a significant proportion of
the workday performing prohibited work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
While no universal time line may be imposed, the
continuous performance of otherwise prohibited work (operating prohibited
machinery) for more than one hour in a workday is more than intermittent and
more than for a “short period of time.”  The performance of otherwise
prohibited work throughout a work shift which totals
more than 20% of the apprentice’s or student-learner’s work shift is also more
than for a “short period of time.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The
term direct and close supervision is not defined in the regulations. 
Apprenticeship agreements registered with OA or OA-approved state agencies,
however, do establish ratios concerning the number of journey workers and
apprentices that may be on the job site at any one time.  These ratios help ensure
worker safety and that the apprentices receive both proper training and
supervision.  According to OA, the most widely used ratio is one apprentice for
the first journey level worker on-site and one apprentice for every three
additional journey workers thereafter.  For the purpose of the limited
exemption contained in 29 CFR 570.50, the requirement of direct and
close supervision is met when there is one journey worker or experienced adult
working with the first apprentice or student-learner on-site, and at least
three journey workers or experienced adults working along side each additional
apprentice or student-learner.  The requirement for direct and close
supervision only applies during the periods when the apprentice or
student-learner is actually performing the otherwise prohibited work.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33g07.   Wage and Hour “STOP” stickers for hazardous equipment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
As part of our YouthRules!
initiative, WH has produced a supply of special “STOP” stickers which employers
may place on hazardous equipment to alert workers that they must be at least 18
years of age to operate and/or clean the equipment.  The stickers are
appropriate for use on meat slicers, forklifts, balers, compactors,
power-driven bakery equipment, freight elevators, power saws, etc.  These stickers
may also be downloaded from the YouthRules! Website.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
There are three versions of these
stickers:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  One warns employees that they must be “18 TO OPERATE
OR CLEAN THIS EQUIPMENT” and encourages the reader to contact WH for more
information about the CL laws (see Exhibit A below).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  One states “NO OPERATORS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE” and
encourages the reader to contact the Wage and Hour Division for more
information about the CL laws (see Exhibit B below). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The third sticker, designed exclusively for use on forklifts
in nonagricultural work places, states in English and Spanish “No operators
under 18 years of age—IT’S THE LAW.”  The forklift stop sticker was developed
in conjunction with the Massachusetts Department of Health and the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (see Exhibit C
below). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Employers who use these stickers
should place them in conspicuous spots on the equipment, but never cover up
other important information such as safety instructions, model numbers, or
emergency guidelines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Use of the stickers does not
remove, in any way, an employer’s obligation to ensure compliance with all CL
provisions at all times.</p>

<h3>33h00 . Format of Section 33h.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Each
of the 17 Nonagricultural HOs is presented in 33h using the following format:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
Scope of HO:  This section
discusses the scope and extent of the HO, including whether the HO is
industry-wide, process, or machine-specific.  It also discusses whether the HO
prohibits ancillary duties (assisting to operate, riding on, cleaning, oiling,
etc.) and whether the named machines are prohibited in all covered
establishments.  A “definitions” section is included where appropriate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
Occupations Prohibited:  This
section describes the occupations, processes or machines that are prohibited by
the HO based on the original report issued in conjunction with the HO, as well
as those included by later rulemaking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
Occupations Not Specifically
Banned:  This section describes the occupations that are not specifically
banned and, therefore, are permitted for 16- and 17-year-olds.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
Exemptions:  This section
discusses statutory or regulatory exemptions, such as the exemption for
student-learners and apprentices.  </p>

<h3>33h01 .      HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 1—Manufacturing or Storage
Occupations Involving Explosives.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name: 
Occupations in or about Plants or Establishments Manufacturing or Storing
Explosives or Articles Containing Explosive Components </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally
Adopted:  July 1, 1939</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 1</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Workers in plants or establishments manufacturing or
storing explosives, including articles containing explosive components, are
especially subject to accident from explosions despite the progress made by
manufacturers and OSHA in developing safeguards.  The finding of the original
investigation accompanying the report was that the accident severity rate for
explosive manufacturing was about twice as great as the average for all
manufacturing industries in 1936.  The injuries resulting from such explosions
are often serious, resulting in fatalities or permanent injuries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  This order deals with occupations in plants or
establishments engaged in manufacturing, handling, storing, and transporting of
explosives, articles containing explosive components, small arms ammunition,
blasting caps and primers.  This includes fireworks (see FOH 33h01(a)(4)a
for the definitions of the terms explosives and articles
containing explosive components).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The order does not apply to the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Retail stores, including the
storage of ammunition in gun shops, sporting goods stores, building supplies
and hardware stores; retail fireworks stands; and other retail establishments. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Gun clubs, trap and skeet ranges,
turkey shoots, certain armories, police stations and other such areas where
only small arms ammunition is being stored. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The use of explosives in mining
operations is covered by HOs 3 and 9.  The use of explosives in demolition and
ship-breaking work is covered by HO 15.  The use of explosives in excavation
work is covered by HO 17.  Storage of explosives at such sites, however, is
covered under HO 1. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Definitions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The terms explosives and articles
containing explosive components mean and include ammunition, black powder,
blasting caps, fireworks, high explosives, primers, smokeless powder, and
explosives and explosive materials as defined in 18 U.S.C. 841(c)-(f) and the
implementing regulations at 27 CFR part 555.  The terms include any chemical
compound, mixture, or device, the primary or common purpose of which is to
function by explosion, as well as all goods identified in the most recent list
of explosive materials published by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms,
and Explosives, Department of Justice.  This list is not intended to be
all-inclusive and is updated and published annually in the Federal
Register pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 841(d).  A copy of the most recent
version of the list may be found through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms, and Explosive’s Website located at <a href="http://www.atf.gov">www.atf.gov</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The term plant or establishment
manufacturing or storing explosives or articles containing explosive components
means the land with all the buildings and other structures thereon used in
connection with the manufacturing or processing or storing of explosives or
articles containing explosive components.  Types of establishments which may
store these materials include ammunition depots, dynamite magazines, bunkers,
armories, and fireworks warehouses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The term nonexplosives areas as
used in the exception in HO 1 are those which meet all four criteria found in
29 CFR 570.51(b)(3) and listed below (the criteria are such that ordinarily
only areas in large plants or establishments could qualify – a small fireworks plant
or establishment would not ordinarily cover such a large area that it could
sustain a “nonexplosives area”):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
None of the work performed in the
area involves the handling or use of explosives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
The area is separated from the
explosives area by a distance not less than that prescribed in the American
Table of Distances for the protection of inhabited buildings.  The American
Table of Distances, published by the Institute of Makers of Explosives, was
last revised in 1991.  The table lists “minimum safe distances” for the
location of explosive storage and manufacturing buildings from inhabited
buildings, railways, highways, etc.  These distances vary with the type and
amount of explosive materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
The area is separated from the
explosives area by a fence or is otherwise located so that it constitutes a
definite designated area.  The phrase “or is otherwise located so that is
constitutes a definite designated area” was included to bring in any area which
is located at a great distance from the explosives area, or is on the other
side of a natural barricade at least comparable to a fence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.    
Satisfactory controls have been
established to prevent employees under 18 years of age within the area from
entering any area in or about the plant that does not meet the above three
criteria.  The painting of a warning on the doors of all buildings containing
explosives advising minors under 18 years of age to stay out does not satisfy
this requirement.  Such warnings would have no actual restraining effect on
employees under 18 years of age and, by themselves, would not constitute a
satisfactory control within the intent of 29 CFR 570.51(b)(3).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b>.   Sixteen- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from
performing:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  All occupations in or about any plant or establishment
(other than retail establishments and those establishments which manufacture or
store small-arms ammunition as described in FOH 33h01(b)(2) below); except 16-
and 17-year-olds may perform work that does not involve the handling or use of explosives
in qualifying “nonexplosives areas.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The following work in plants manufacturing or storing
small-arms ammunition not exceeding .60 caliber in size, shotgun shells, or
blasting caps when manufactured or stored in conjunction with the manufacture of
small-arm ammunitions: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
All occupations involved in the
manufacturing, mixing, transporting, or handling of explosive compounds in the
manufacture of small-arms ammunition and all other occupations requiring the
performance of any duties in the explosives area in which explosive compounds
are manufactured or mixed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
All occupations involved in the
manufacturing, transporting, or handling of primers and all other occupations
requiring the performance of any duties in the same building in which primers
are manufactured.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
All occupations involved in the
priming of cartridges and all other occupations requiring the performance of
any duties in the same work room in which rim-fire cartridges are primed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
All occupations involved in the
plate loading of cartridges and in the operation of automatic loading machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
All occupations involved in the
loading, inspecting, packing, shipping, and storage of blasting caps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The following work peculiar to the “fireworks”
industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
HO 1 applies to homeworkers engaged
in the manufacture of fireworks in their own homes.  Since explosives are
stored in the home prior to and after assembly, a homeworker’s home would meet
the definition of a “plant or establishment manufacturing or storing
explosives.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
HO 1 applies to “shooters” who are
hired by various civic organizations and governments to transport fireworks
from the manufacturer or wholesaler to the display site, set up the fireworks
at the site, load mortars (tubes from which the shells are fired), and fire
shells.  Fireworks must be temporarily stored at the site prior to the
display.  The term “establishments storing explosives” in 29 CFR 570.51(b)(1)
is sufficiently broad to cover these storage situations.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Work which involves the storage of ammunition and/or
explosives. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
HO 1 applies to any establishment,
other than a retail establishment, which stores ammunition (other than
small-arms ammunition not exceeding .60 caliber) or explosives, regardless of
whether or not manufacturing takes place at the facility.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Minors 16 and 17 years of age,
however, could work in a “nonexplosives area” of such an establishment or at an
establishment where only small-arms ammunition was stored.  Central warehouses
used by retail stores, lacking the retail concept, would also be covered by HO
1. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  HO 1 does not cover retail establishments selling
explosives or articles containing explosive components such as hardware stores,
fireworks outlets, or building supply stores.  Individual storerooms, located
at retail stores used to stock merchandise sold by that store, are also not
covered by HO 1 (see FOH 33h01(b)(4)b above concerning
warehouses).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Work in plants manufacturing explosives, in plants
storing explosives, and in plants manufacturing articles containing explosive
components which does not involve the handling or use of explosives and which
is performed in a “nonexplosives area.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  All work in plants manufacturing or storing small-arms
ammunition (not exceeding .60 caliber) or blasting caps that is not
specifically prohibited by HO 1.  Examples include working as an inspector,
office work, machine operators (if not covered by HOs 5 or 8), packing (except
blasting caps), shipping, and other work not involving the handling of explosives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There
are no provisions in HO 1 for apprentices or student-learners.  There are no
other exemptions applicable to this order.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
Enforcement positions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) 
Geophysical survey
crews</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Jug handlers (those
who help string the wire from the shooting hole to the recording equipment) in
geophysical surveys which involve the detonation of explosives in underground
locations are not subject to the prohibitions of HO 1.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The overnight parking
of trucks containing explosives used by the survey crews is not sufficient for
the trucks to be considered establishments storing explosives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Generally, no area in fireworks plants can meet the
“non-explosive area” criteria of 29 CFR 570.51(b)(3).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33h02.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 2—Motor-Vehicle Occupations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name: 
Occupations of Motor-vehicle Driver and Outside Helper</p>
<p>Originally Adopted:  January 1, 1940&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 2 </b>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1)  Driving a motor vehicle involves a high degree of
accident risk for persons of all ages, and is particularly hazardous for minors
between the ages of 16 and 18 due to their lack of experience.  Despite the
prohibitions of HO 2, transportation-related deaths, largely
highway incidents, remained the most frequently recorded cause of occupational
deaths of 16- and 17-year-olds between 1980 and 2007.  HO 2 applies to all
employers subject to the nonagricultural CL provisions of the FLSA and, with a
limited statutory exception, specifically prohibits the employment of persons
under the age of 18 as motor-vehicle operators and as “outside helpers” on any
public road, highway and in or about any mine (including open pit mine or
quarry), place where logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any
excavation covered by HO 17.  However, driving on private property (other than
described above) is permitted.  These provisions apply whether the employee is
driving a personal or business owned-vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2)  The Drive for Teen Employment Act, effective October
31, 1998, amended the FLSA by creating § 13(c)(6) and established the
conditions under which 17-year-olds (but not those under 17 years of age) may
drive certain automobiles and trucks on the job.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3)  Definitions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a.    
The
term motor vehicle shall mean any automobile, truck, truck-tractor, trailer,
semi-trailer, motorcycle, or similar vehicle propelled or drawn by mechanical
power and designed for use as a means of transportation but shall not include
any vehicle operated exclusively on rails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.    
The
above definition is not dependent upon the source of energy – vehicles may be
propelled by gasoline, propane, electricity, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.    
This
definition does not require that the motor vehicle be licensed or outfitted
with special equipment, nor is the size of the vehicle a factor.  Golf carts,
all terrain vehicles (ATVs), and riding mowers designed or used as a means of
transportation, meet the definition of “motor vehicles” and fall within the
scope of HO 2 when operated on any public road or highway (see 75 FR 28409). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.    
The
term “similar vehicle” includes buses, vans, mopeds, pickup trucks, panel
trucks, recreational vehicles, ice-cream and chuck-wagon-type trucks, motorized
trail bikes, jeeps, and other all terrain vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b.    
The
term driver shall mean any individual who, in the course of employment, drives
a motor vehicle at any time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c.    
The
term outside helper shall mean any individual, other than a driver, whose work
includes riding on a motor vehicle outside the cab for the purpose of assisting
in transporting or delivering goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d.    
The
term gross vehicle weight includes the truck chassis with lubricants, water and
a full tank or tanks of fuel, plus the weight of the cab or driver’s
compartment, body and special chassis and body equipment, and payload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e.    
The
term occasional and incidental driving is now defined in the FLSA as driving
that involves no more than one-third of the worktime in any work day and no
more than 20 percent of the worktime in any workweek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;f.     
The
term urgent, time-sensitive deliveries means trips which, because of such
factors as customer satisfaction, the rapid deterioration of the quality or
change in temperature of the product, and/or economic incentives, are subject
to time-lines, schedules, and/or turn around times which might impel the driver
to hurry in the completion of the delivery.  Prohibited trips would include,
but are not limited to, the delivery of pizzas and prepared foods to the
customers; the delivery of materials under a deadline (such as deposits to a
bank at closing, or parts to a job site for the completion of an emergency
repair job); and the shuttling of passengers to and from transportation depots to
meet transport schedules.  Urgent, time sensitive deliveries do not depend on
the delivery’s points of origin and termination, and include the delivery of
people and things to the employer’s place of business as well as from that
business to some other location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;g.    
To
define the term public road, WHD uses the generally accepted definition of a
public road as “a road or way established and adopted (or accepted as a
dedication) by the proper authorities for the use of the general public, and
over which every person has a right to pass and to use it for all purposes of
travel or transportation to which it is adapted and devoted.  The proper test
in determining whether [a] road is a ‘public’ or ‘private road’ is [the] use to
which such roadway is put, and [the] fact that [the] road has been constructed
at public expense is not conclusive” (Bush &amp; Burchett, Inc. v. Reich, 117
F.3d 932, 938 n. 11 (6th Cir. 1997), citing Black’s Law Dictionary
1329 (6th ed. 1990)).  Under this standard, a pathway or road in or
at the perimeter of a City park would not be considered a public road, if it is
used only by pedestrians, bicyclists, golf carts, and similar traffic to access
parts of the park grounds for recreational purposes.  But if the pathway or
road is used by automobiles or trucks to traverse the park or to access park
facilities for purposes such as delivery of goods, then it would be considered
a public road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(b)   <b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1)  Driving any type of motor vehicle on public roads or
highways and in or about any mine (including open pit mine or quarry), place
where logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any excavation
covered by HO 17, except as authorized by § 13(c)(6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2)  Riding outside the cab of a vehicle as an outside
helper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3)  Towing of any vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1)  Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may operate motor vehicles
on private property other than any mine (including open pit mine or quarry),
place where logging or sawmill operations are in progress, or in any excavation
covered by HO 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2)  Other motorized vehicles to which HO 2 does not apply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a.    
HO 2
does not apply to self-propelled vehicles that are designed to perform work as
distinguished from being used “as a means of transportation.”  This includes
certain types of riding mowers, farm tractors, bulldozers, road scrapers, and
other vehicles not suitable for travel on public streets, geared only for
off-the-road use, and only designed for use on construction sites, grassy areas
and along walk paths.  When it is necessary to move such vehicles any distance,
they are generally loaded on a lowboy-type flatbed trailer and transported from
job site to job site.  Some of these vehicles, however, may be prohibited under
HO 17 when used in excavation.  Note:  See “Enforcement positions”
(FOH 33h02(e)(3)) regarding riding mowers and golf carts that must cross
public roads to complete a work assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b.    
Trucks
that have equipment permanently mounted on them (such as mobile drilling rigs)
or equipment that has its own built-in means of transport are considered motor
vehicles under HO 2 and fall under the prohibitions of the HO when
operated on public roads.  Some of these trucks and pieces of equipment can
travel at speeds in excess of 30 miles per hour.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c.    
Certain
electric carts are used as a means of transportation in large industrial
plants, and at railroad stations and airport terminals.  Generally, such
vehicles are outside the scope of HO 2 unless employees use these vehicles as a
means of transportation on a public street.  Thus, 16- and 17-year-old minors
may operate motorized vehicles such as riding mowers or golf carts as long as
they are not driven on public roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(d)   <b>Exemptions</b>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1)  HO 2 does not contain an
exemption for apprentices or student-learners.  Furthermore, none of the
limited exemptions applicable to HOs 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17 permit
apprentices or student-learners to drive motor-vehicles as part of their
training programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2)  Occasional and
incidental driving by 17-year-olds.  The Drive for Teen Employment Act, enacted
on October 31, 1998, amended the FLSA to permit 17-year-olds (but not those
under 17 years of age) to drive automobiles and trucks as part of their
employment if all of the following criteria are met:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a.     The automobile or truck does
not exceed 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b.     The driving is
restricted to daylight hours,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c.     The minor holds a state
license valid for the type of driving involved in the job performed,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d.     The minor has
successfully completed a state approved driver education course,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;e.     The minor has no records
of any moving violation at the time of hire,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;f.      The vehicle is equipped
with a seat belt for the driver and any passengers and the employer has
instructed the youth that the seat belts must be used when driving the vehicle,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;g.     The driving does not
involve:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.     Towing
vehicles,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.     Route
deliveries or route sales,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.     Transportation
for hire of property, goods, or passengers,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.     Urgent,
time sensitive-deliveries,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.     Transporting more than 3
passengers, including employees of the employer,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6.     Driving beyond a 30 mile
radius from the minor’s place of employment,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7.     More than two trips away
from the primary place of employment in any single day to deliver the
employer’s goods to a customer (other than urgent, time-sensitive deliveries
which are prohibited), or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8.     More than two trips away
from the primary place of employment in any single day to transport passengers,
other than employees of the employer, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;h.     Such driving is only
occasional and incidental to the minor’s employment.  This means that the youth
may spend no more than one-third of the worktime in any workday and no more
than 20 percent of the worktime in any workweek driving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(e)   <b>Enforcement positions</b>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1)  Ambulance attendants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minors 16 and 17 years of age who have completed
the necessary training as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and are employed
as qualified ambulance attendants are not “outside helpers” within the meaning
of HO 2 and may ride in the rear of the ambulance while attending the patient
being transported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2)  Cart caddy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operation of battery operated “cart caddy”
machines used by grocery stores to move large strings of shopping carts back to
the front area of the store would be a permissible occupation for minors 16 and
17 years of age.  This machine is not considered a “motor vehicle” and does not
fall within the scope of HO 2.  However, as it is a power-driven machine, its
use by 14- and 15-year-olds is prohibited under CL Reg 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3)  Golf carts and riding
mowers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a.     Golf carts, riding
mowers, and similar motorized vehicles fall within the scope of HO 2 if used as
a means of transportation on public roads.  Because these motorized vehicles
are not “automobiles or trucks, operation of such vehicles would not fall under
the limited exemption contained in FLSA § 13(c)(6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b.     There are certain
situations where a public road traverses a golf course or other establishments
where motorized vehicles are used off the roadway.  It may be necessary for
golf carts, riding mowers, or other motorized vehicles to cross the public road
in order to reach a particular work site or return to the club house.  Although
a strict interpretation of HO 2 would prohibit those under 18 years of age from
driving the carts and mowers across public roads, WH will not assert a
violation of HO 2 if the contact with the public road involves only the
crossing of that road, and such crossings occur only at marked cross walks and
pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(4)  Messengers &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may, under certain
conditions, be employed as messengers and errand boys/girls by firms other than
public messenger services to pick up and deliver messages or packages in
passenger type vehicles operated by someone other than the minor (see
FOH 33c(19)(b), see also § 570.34(o)).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<h3>33h03.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 3—Coal Mine Occupations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name: 
Coal Mine Occupations</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally
Adopted:  September 1, 1940</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a) <b>Scope of HO 3</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The report that established HO 3 found accident rates
(including death and dismemberment) for adults employed in and about coal mines
far exceed accident rates in other industries.  This report did not address
long term occupational illnesses such as “black lung.”  As of the last census
before the report was issued (1930), three per cent of workers employed in coal
mines were under the age of eighteen (approximately 16,000 minors).  Typically,
if employed underground, the young people worked as “miner’s helpers” loading
coal, or as “trappers” or “door boys” opening and closing doors (regulating air
flow) to allow the passage of coal cars.  If employed above ground, they worked
as slate pickers, as helpers in repair shops, or in general clean up work.  The
report concluded that the risk of injury to youths employed in coal mines was
great due to the rate of accidents involving adults, and due to their lack of
experience and good judgment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 3 is industry specific.  Its scope includes all
types of work performed in or about an underground mine, an open-pit (strip)
mine, or at the surface part of the mining plant that contributes to the
extraction, grading, cleaning, or other handling of coal.  The scope of this
order does not cover slate or refuse picking at certain designated areas, and
work solely in offices, or in repair and maintenance shops located in the
surface area of any coal-mining plant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Definitions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Coal shall mean any rank of coal,
including lignite, bituminous, and anthracite coals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
Lignite coal is a brownish-black
coal intermediate between peat and bituminous coal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
Bituminous coal is of medium age
(geologically).  It is “soft” and after burning it leaves bitumen—a tar like
substance.  It makes up the majority of the coal reserves in the United States.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
Anthracite coal is the oldest coal
(geologically).  It is “hard” and burns clean.  It is found almost exclusively
in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The term occupation in or about
any coal mine shall mean all types of work performed in any underground
working, open-pit, or surface part of any coal mining plant, that contribute to
the extraction, grading, cleaning, or other handling of coal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The term tipple refers to a place
where, or an apparatus by which, cars of coal are loaded or emptied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b) <b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  All work in underground coal mines, such as:  miner,
miner’s helper, loader, shearing-machine operator, loading-machine operator,
driller, shot firer, motorman, trackman, or timberman, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  All work in an open pit coal mine, such as:  miner,
shovel operator, electrician, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  All work on the surface part of an underground or
open-pit mine (or mining plant) except that permitted in FOH 33h03(c).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c) <b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY BANNED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>On
the surface part of the coal mining plant, 16 and 17 year olds may:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Engage in slate or other refuse picking at a picking
table, or at a picking chute in a tipple or a breaker.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Engage in occupations where the work occurs solely in offices,
or in repair or maintenance shops (which are located above ground).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d) <b>Enforcement positions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Stock clerk working on the premises of a coal mine  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This
occupation is prohibited for 16- or 17-year-olds if it involves moving about
the mine premises delivering supplies, crossing railroad tracks, being in the
vicinity of loading chutes, or otherwise working outside of the warehouse. 
Conversely, this work is permitted if it is confined solely to the warehouse
structure on the surface part of the mining plant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Motor-vehicle operator and outside helper</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO 3
prohibits almost all work in or about a mine, which would include the
occupations of motor-vehicle driver and outside helper.  HO 2 also specifically
prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from performing the occupations of motor-vehicle
driver and outside helper in or about any mine, including open pit mine or
quarry.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Cleaning under a coal tipple or breaker</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This
work is prohibited by HO 3, as is the pining of railroad cars onto the main
spur track, and the cleaning of railroad cars.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Watchman</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO 3
prohibits 16 or 17 year olds from working as watchmen if they work in or about
the surface part of the mining operation (i.e., working around
railroad tracks, loading chutes, etc.).  However, if the area where the work is
performed is sufficiently removed (one mile or more) from the site of the
mining operation, then it would not be work “in or about a mine,” and such work
would be permissible for 16 and 17 year olds.  For example, 16 or 17 year olds
may work as watchmen at the front gate of the mine, or at an office, if they
are located more than one mile from the site of the mining operation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Surveying</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Surveying
work to plan future mining fields that is done well in advance of any mining
operation and at least one mile from current mining operations is not work in
the “surface part of any coal mining plant.”  Consequently, such work is
permitted for 16- and 17-year-olds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Screening Coal</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
screening of coal is an occupation prohibited by HO 3.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e) <b>Exemptions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There
are no provisions in HO 3 for apprentices or student-learners.  There are no
other exemptions applicable to this order.  </p>

<h3>33h04 . HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 4—Forestry Occupations, Logging and
Sawmilling.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name:  Forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention occupations,
timber tract occupations, forestry service occupations, logging occupations,
and occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or
cooperage stock mill. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally Adopted:  August 1, 1941</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 4</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The many accidents and injuries in logging made it the
most hazardous manufacturing industry at the time of the original order. 
Sawmilling ranked second.  This was based on both the frequency with which
accidents occurred as well as the severity of the resulting injuries.  A
December 1994 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
Alert – Request for Assistance in Preventing Injuries and Deaths of Loggers –
confirmed the earlier finding of the risks involved in logging.  During the period
from 1980-1989, the National Traumatic Occupational Fatalities Surveillance
System reported 1,492 deaths of workers in the logging industry, resulting in
an annual fatality rate more than 20 times that for all workers (164 deaths per
100,000 workers compared with 7 per 100,000 for all workers).  Most of these
deaths occurred in four occupational groups:  logging occupations (for example,
fellers, limbers, buckers, and choker setters), truck drivers, general
laborers, and material machine operators. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 4 prohibits, with a few exceptions, the performance
of all occupations in the logging industry, in sawmills, lath mills, and
cooperage-stock mills.  HO 4 was amended several times and new sections were
added during World War II (on September 11, 1942, and June 24, 1943), to permit
the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds in saw filing and certain occupations in
logging for the duration of the war and six months afterwards. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  On February 2, 1948, and again on April 15, 1967, HO 4
was revised to permit 16- and 17-year-olds to perform specific tasks in
logging, logging camps, and outside shake and shingle mills. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The Department of Labor Appropriations Act, 2004 (PL
108-199) amended the FLSA by creating a limited exemption from the child labor
provisions for minors 14 to 18 years of age who are excused from compulsory
school attendance beyond the eighth grade.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The exemption, contained in §
13(c)(7) of the FLSA, allows eligible youth to be employed by businesses that
use machinery to process wood products, but does not allow such youth to
operate or assist in operating power-driven woodworking machines.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The provisions of FLSA § 13(c)(7)
impact CL Reg 3 (see FOH 33c01) and HO 4 (see
FOH 33h04(d)).  A Final Rule was published on May 20, 2010 (see 75 FR
28404) that incorporated the provisions of the amended § 13(c)(7) by revising
subparts C and E of 29 CFR part 570.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  The 2010 Final Rule (see 75 FR 28429) also expanded HO
4 to prohibit most work in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention,
timber tract occupations, and forestry service operations (see 29 CFR 570.54).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Definitions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
the term all occupations in forest
fire fighting and forest fire prevention shall include the controlling and
extinguishing of fires, the wetting down of areas or extinguishing of spot
fires, and the patrolling of burned areas to assure the fire has been extinguished. 
The term shall also include the following tasks when performed in conjunction
with, or in support of, efforts to extinguish a forest fire:  the piling and
burning of slash; the clearing of fire trails or roads; the construction,
maintenance, and patrolling of fire lines; acting as a fire lookout or fire
patrolman; and the maintaining of fire fighting equipment.  The prohibition against
the employment of youth in forest fire fighting and fire prevention applies to
all forest and timber tract locations, logging operations, and sawmill
operations, including all buildings located within such areas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The term all occupations in
forestry services shall mean all work involved in the support of timber
production, wood technology, forestry economics and marketing, and forest
protection.  The term includes such services as timber cruising, surveying, or
logging-engineering parties; estimating timber; timber valuation; forest pest
control; forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention as defined in this section;
and reforestation.  The term shall not include work in forest nurseries,
establishments primarily engaged in growing trees for purposes of
reforestation.  The term shall not include the gathering of forest products
such as balsam needles, ginseng, huckleberry greens, maple sap, moss, Spanish
moss, sphagnum moss, teaberries, and tree seeds; the distillation of gum,
turpentine, and rosin if carried on at the gum farm; and the extraction of pine
gum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The term all occupations in
logging shall mean all work performed in conjunction with the felling of
timber; the bucking or converting of timber into logs, poles, piles, ties,
bolts, pulpwood, chemical wood, excelsior wood, cordwood, fence posts, or
similar products; the collecting, skidding, yarding, loading, transporting and
unloading of such products in connection with logging; the constructing,
repairing and maintaining of roads, railroads, flumes, or camps used in
connection with logging; and other work performed in connection with logging. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
The term all occupations in the
operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage-stock mill
shall mean all work performed in or about any such mill in connection with
storing of logs and bolts; converting logs or bolts into sawn lumber, laths,
shingles, or cooperage stock, or other products of such mills; and other work
performed in connection with the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle
mill, or cooperage-stock mill.  The term shall not include work performed in
the planing-mill department or other remanufacturing departments of any
sawmill, or in any planing-mill or remanufacturing plant not a part of a
sawmill (This work could be prohibited under HO 5 if the minor operated
power-driven wood working machines).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
The term all occupations in timber
tracts means all work performed in or about establishments that cultivate,
manage or sell standing timber.  The term includes work performed in timber
culture, timber tracts, timber-stand improvement, and forest fire fighting and
fire prevention.  It includes work on tree farms, except those tree farm
establishments that meet the definition of agriculture contained in 29 U.S.C.
203(f). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>f.     
The terms remanufacturing plant
and remanufacturing departments as used in (d) above refer to those
manufacturing departments of a sawmill where lumber products such as boxes,
lawn furniture, and the like are re-manufactured from previously cut lumber. 
The kind of work performed in a remanufacturing plant or department is similar
to that done in the planing-mill department in that rough lumber is surfaced or
made into other finished products.  The term is not intended to denote those
operations in a sawmill where rough lumber is cut to dimensions.  The mere
cutting of rough wood into smaller size pieces would not constitute
remanufacturing under HO 4.</p>

<p>(4)  Work in the feeding or care of animals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  HO 4 does not apply to the following logging
occupations:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Repair and maintenance of
railroads, roads, or flumes (but not construction work) as performed by section
hands, grade and track crews, laborers, swampers, and carpenters, as long as
the work is not prohibited by any other HO.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Any work done in the maintenance

<p> </p>
<p>(6)  HO 4 does not apply to the following sawmilling
occupations provided such work does not entail entering the sawmill except for
those minors whose employment meets the requirements of the limited exemptions
discussed in §§ 570.34(m) and 570.54:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The following occupations on the

<p> </p>
<p>6.     Clean-up in the lumberyard.</p>
<p>7.    
Clerical work in yards or shipping
sheds, such as done by order-men, tallymen, and shipping clerks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  There is no provision in HO 4 for apprentices or
student-learners.  The logging section of the order was reviewed in 1974 in
response to a request for a student-learner exemption in logging operations. 
It was determined that the industry had not substantially changed, the hazards
remained the same, and the request was denied.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  FLSA § 13(c)(7) – Employment of Certain Minors in
Places of Business That Use Machinery to Process Wood Products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The Department of Labor
Appropriations Act of 2004 amended the FLSA by creating a limited exemption
from the child labor provisions for certain minors 14 to 18 years old which
allows them to be employed inside and outside places of businesses that use
machinery to process wood products (such as sawmills, furniture manufacturers,
cabinet makers, garden shed and gazebo manufacturers, and pallet shops).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
With regard to such
establishments, this amendment overrides the general CL Reg 3 prohibitions
regarding the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing occupations,
processing occupations, and in work places where goods are manufactured or
processed.  It also overrides the HO 4 prohibition regarding the employment of
youth in occupations that entail entering the sawmill building.  This
exemption, however, does not excuse compliance with the remaining CL Reg 3
occupations standards and all of the CL Reg 3 hours standards in regards to the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds; nor does it excuse compliance with the
provisions of all of the other HOs in regards to the employment of youths aged
14 through 17 (see § 570.34(m)(2)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Under this exemption, contained at
FLSA § 13(c)(7), an eligible youth is one who is under the age of 18 and at
least the age of 14 who by statute or judicial order is exempt from compulsory
school attendance beyond the eighth grade.  In addition, the youth must be
supervised on the job by an adult relative or by an adult of the same religious
sect or division as the youth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
An adult
is someone who has reached his or her eighteenth birthday. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
A
relative, for purposes of this exemption, includes at a minimum a parent or
person standing in place of a parent, a grandparent, an aunt or uncle, or a
sibling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
Such
supervision must be close, direct, constant, and uninterrupted (see 29
CFR 570.54(b)). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Such minors are still prohibited
from operating or assisting in the operation of power-driven woodworking
machines by virtue of § 13(c)(7) and HO 5.  Power-driven
woodworking machines include all fixed or portable machines or tools driven by
power and used or designed for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing,
stapling, wire stitching, fastening or otherwise assembling, pressing or
printing wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber (see FOH 33h05(a)(5)a.). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
In addition, the employer must
ensure that the minors are protected from wood particles or other flying
debris within the work place by a barrier appropriate to the potential
hazard of such wood particles or flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient
distance from machinery in operation.  The minors must also use personal
protective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive levels of noise
and saw dust. Compliance with these provisions will be accomplished when the
employer is in compliance with the requirements of the applicable governing
standards issued by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) or, in those states where OSHA has authorized the
state to operate its own Occupational Safety and Health Plan, the applicable
standards issued by the Office charged with administering the State Occupations
Safety and Health Plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Veneer mills</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Veneer
mills expose minors to similar, if not identical, hazards that are present in
sawmills –
saws, sharp blades, heavy logs, hoisting apparatus, cranes, forklifts, as well
as dust and noise pollution.  Veneer mills are treated the same as sawmills
under HO 4. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Firewood</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cutting
and splitting logs and the collecting, stacking, and loading of firewood are
considered “converting of timber into pulpwood, cordwood, or similar products”
and therefore this work is prohibited by HO 4 (see WHD Director A.W. Motley's
letter of May 20, 1959).  The prohibition against the employment of youth under
18 years of age to cut, split, collect, stack, and load firewood applies to all
covered employment—not just work in forestry, sawmilling, or logging.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Power-driven wood chipping machines</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Occupations in
connection with the operation of wood chipping machines when used in the woods
in logging operations would be subject to the 18-year minimum age under both HO
4 and HO 14.  Child labor violations involving wood chipping machines, in any
nonagricultural occupation or industry, will be recorded as being a violation
of HO 14.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Stump removal</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stump pulling using
tractors in nonagricultural situations is not subject to HO 4.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Christmas trees</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An ordinary
household-sized Christmas tree is not considered to be timber, nor is it cut
into log lengths or converted into lumber products—therefore, HO 4 does not
apply (see Director of Children's Bureau Industrial Division McConnell's letter
of October 29, 1942).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Clearing right-of-way for power lines, highways</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Activities in
connection with the clearing of a right-of-way would not be within the scope of
HO 4 since these are not logging operations.  HO 4 does not cover the clearing
of land in preparation for highway construction (see Regional Solicitor Barnes'
memorandum of June 25, 1959). </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33h05.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 5—Power-Driven Woodworking Machine Operations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name:     Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven
wood-working machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally Adopted:  August 1, 1941</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 5</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Power-driven woodworking machines are among the most
hazardous of all machine tools. Although great strides have been made by
manufacturers and OSHA to improve the safety of such machines through design
changes and guarding, the risk of injury to operators or workers assisting to
operate such machines has not been eliminated.  Several hazardous factors are
inherent to woodworking machines—extremely high speeds of operation, sharpness
of cutting tools, and the lightness of material being cut making “kick-backs”
possible.  The fact that many woodworking machines are hand fed increases the
hazards.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  This order is very broad in scope and is applied on a
machine basis.  Basically, if a minor, while performing covered employment, is
operating, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and/or cleaning a
power-driven wood working machine, HO 5 most likely applies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  HO 5 does not apply when the machinery or tools are
designed to be used, and are used exclusively, on materials other than
wood—such as metal, plastic or stone.  Another HO (such as HO 8, 14, 16 or 17)
may prohibit such work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  HO 5 applies in any industries where power-driven
woodworking tools are used—including furniture plants; sawmills, cabinet makers
and other woodworking plants and shops; construction sites; packing sheds;
retail and service establishments such as hardware and lumber stores; state and
local government entities; and other industries which use power-driven
woodworking machines, but which may not directly manufacture wood products.  Even
though FLSA § 13(c)(7) exempts certain minors 14 to 17 years of age from
the HO 4 prohibition concerning the performance of work that entails entering a
sawmill building, the HO 5 prohibitions regarding operating and assisting to
operate power-driven woodworking machines are applicable to the employment of
those youth who may now legally work in a sawmill.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Definitions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The term power-driven woodworking
machine shall mean all fixed or portable machines or tools driven by power and
used or designed for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing, stapling,
wire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing, or printing wood,
veneer, trees, logs, or lumber.  This definition is broad and includes machines
used at the time the order was issued as well as all power-driven woodworking
machines developed in subsequent years.  It may also apply to multiple-use
woodworking machines as well as those designed for a single woodworking
purpose.  A machine that was designed to be used on wood is prohibited by HO 5
even when used to cut, shape, form, etc., a material other than wood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The term driven by power shall
mean machines driven by electrical, animal, mechanical, water, or other power
such as steam or hydraulic.  It also includes battery-operated and pneumatic-operated
machines and tools, but does not apply to machines or tools driven by foot or
hand power, such as foot-powered jig saws or hand-operated saws or drills.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The term off-bearing shall mean
the removal of material or refuse directly from a saw table or from the point
of operation.  Operations not considered as off-bearing within the intent of HO
5 include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
The removal of material or refuse
from a circular saw or guillotine-action veneer clipper where the material or
refuse has been conveyed away from the saw table or point of operation by a
gravity chute or by some mechanical means such as a moving belt or expulsion
roller, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
The following operations when they
do not involve the removal of material or refuse directly from a saw or from
the point of operation:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A.   
The carrying, moving, or
transporting of materials from one machine to another or from one part of a
plant to another,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>B.   
The piling, stacking, or arranging
of materials for feeding into a machine by another person, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>C.   
The sorting, tying, bundling or
loading of materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  The following examples of power-driven machines and
tools, when used for “cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing, stapling,
wire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing, or printing wood,
veneer, trees, logs, or lumber” are subject to HO 5.  This list is not
all-inclusive – other machines exist or may be developed which meet the
definition of power-driven woodworking machines:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Cutting – circular saw, band saw,
jig saw, drag saw, chain saw, veneer clipper.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Shaping and forming – shaper,
molder, heel turner, lathe, tenoner, mortiser, sticker, drill, boring machine,
hole cutter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Surfacing – planer, jointer,
sander, barker.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Nailing – nailer, box nailer,
cleat nailer, roofing gun, drywall gun (when used to attach drywall to wood
studs), siding gun, finishing nail gun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
Stapling – stapler.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>f.     
Wire stitching – wire stitcher,
berry-basket machine, bushel-tub machine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>g.    
Fastening, or otherwise assembling
– corrugator or other similar type machine for fastening two pieces of wood
together by means of a metallic fastener of some type.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>h.    
Pressing – veneer press, boxboard
squeezer, and printing press used on wood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  HO 5 prohibits minors from operating power-driven
woodworking equipment in sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, and cooperage
stock mills—industries that are covered by HO 4.  HO 5 (rather than HO 4)
applies to the planing-mill department or other re-manufacturing departments of
these enterprises when contained in buildings separate from the sawmill, lath
mill, shingle mill or cooperage stock mill.  HO 5 also applies to the
employment of minors between the ages of 14 and 17 who, although now permitted
to work in sawmills because of the exemption contained in FLSA § 13(c)(7),
are found to have operated or assisted in the operation of, power-driven
woodworking machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)  Guards.  The fact that a machine is guarded has no
effect on the application of HO 5.  Woodworking machines are the most difficult
to guard and guards alone cannot be relied upon to protect minors from the
hazards of woodworking machines. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the
occupation of operating power-driven woodworking machines, including
supervising or controlling the operation of such machines, feeding material
into such machines, and helping the operator to feed material into such
machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The occupations of operating
woodworking machines includes starting and stopping the machine, adjusting for
the type of work being performed, and placing the wood stock on the machine. 
Machines may be automatic, hand fed or power-fed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
HO 5 does not prohibit these
minors from placing materials on a moving chain or in a hopper or slide for
automatic feeding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the
occupation of setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning
power-driven woodworking machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the
occupation of off-bearing (unloading materials) from circular saws when the
material is not conveyed away from the machine by some mechanical means.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  HO 5 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from the
occupation of off-bearing (unloading materials) from guillotine-action veneer
clippers when the material is not conveyed away from the point of operation by
a moving belt or gravity chain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  The following is a partial list of power-driven
woodworking machines prohibited by HO 5. This equipment may be stationary or
portable and may be powered by batteries:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     Band saws.</p>
<p>b.     Circular saws (table saws, swing

<b>Exemptions </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO 5 does provide an exemption for apprentices and student-learners. 
There are no other exemptions applicable.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Chain saws</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO 14 prohibits minors under 18 years of age from operating chain
saws—regardless of the material being processed.  HO 5 also prohibits the
operation of chain saws to cut wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber because
chain saws, when used as such, are “power-driven woodworking machines”.  HO 4
also prohibits the use of chain saws by minors in logging and sawmilling
operations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Power-driven machines used to cut materials other than
wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
HO 5 applies to any power-driven
machines used or designed for cutting or shaping wood, veneer, trees, logs, or
lumber—regardless of what material is cut by it.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
HO 5 does not prohibit minors from
operating machines designed and used exclusively to cut or shape plastic,
leather, or items other than wood.  HO 14, however, may prohibit minors from
using circular saws, band saws, guillotine shears, wood chippers, reciprocating
saws, chain saws, and abrasive cutting discs to cut these materials. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Certain machine tools are designed
to cut or shape metal.  These tools may have the same name as woodworking tools
and may share many characteristics of woodworking tools.  But if they are
designed to be used on metal, they are not subject to HO 5.  Such tools include
metal drills, lathes, planers, grinders, borers, etc. (see FOH
33h08 for a list of these machines).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The following situations were determined not to fall
under HO 5, mainly because the power-driven woodworking machines were not used
or designed to be used for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing,
stapling, wire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing or
printing wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Operation of staple machines in
the upholstery department of furniture manufacturers, in boat yards or
automobile repair shops, when used to attach vinyl, plastic film, webbing
straps, velcro, plastic molding or fabric to a wooden or plastic seat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Operation of drywall screw guns
when used only to attach drywall to metal studs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Operation of belt sanders when the
sandpaper is designed for use on products other than wood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Operation of rivet machines used
to attach hardware to other objects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
Operation of portable electric
drills used to bore holes in products other than wood, such as metal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>f.     
Operation of tumbler machines used
to polish wood products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>g.    
Operation of electric, pneumatic
and battery-operated screwdrivers which tighten screws but perform no work on
the wood itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>h.    
Operation of routers designed to
be used on metal and used to finish metal countertops and other products not
made of wood (HO 8 does not apply to metal routers).</p>

poisoning were reported in 1929.  A number of these cases involved young women
who were engaged in manufacturing luminous compounds.  Their exposure to radiation
began before they were 18 years of age.  The hazards of radiation exposure have
been found to be greater for young persons since they are less likely to
exercise care to avoid contamination.  Moreover, according to the Occupational
Safety and Health Division of the National Institute of Science and Technology,
several studies have shown that radiation exposure caused more injury to
rapidly growing and dividing cells than to mature cells.  The significant
health risk connected with exposing young people to radiation is highlighted by
the fact that OSHA has recognized this risk by making it its only age specific
standard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
HO 6 was issued to protect people
under the age of 18 from exposure to radiation in the workplace and it applies
to manufacturing plants, storage facilities, hospitals, clinics, laboratories,
dental offices, colleges and universities, and all other covered locations
where there are X-ray machines or other sources of radiation contamination.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
HO 6 was issued before the
development of atomic energy as a weapon during World War II and later as an
energy source.  Consequently, HO 6 does not address problems related to
exposure to atomic energy.  Workers are protected from such hazards by
regulations issued and enforced by the Department of Energy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
HO 6 adopted as its tolerance to
the exposure to radioactive substance in the air the occupational standards
established by the National Committee on Radiation Protection.   This tolerance
was set forth in the National Bureau of Standards Handbook No. 69 entitled:
Maximum Permissible Body Burdens and Maximum Permissible Concentrations of
Radionuclides in Air and in Water for Occupational Exposure.  The rules on
annual intake of radiation were changed in 1993, and the maximum permissible
concentrations in the air for exposure have been replaced by what is known as
the “derived air concentration.”  These requirements, which do not apply to
naturally formed radiation or to medical radiation, are found in 10 CFR part
20, Standards for Protection Against Radiation.</p>
<p>(5)          
Definitions</p>
<p>a.             
The term self-luminous compound
shall mean any mixture of phosphorescent material and radium, mesothorium, or
other radioactive element.</p>
<p>b.

and all other radiations which produce ionizations directly or indirectly, but
does not include electromagnetic radiations other than gamma and X-ray.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
Occupations PROHIBITED</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
Any work in any workroom in which:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
Radium is stored or used in the

<p>   </p>
<p>(2)          
Any other work which involves
exposure to ionizing radiation in excess of 0.5 rem per year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
Work in medical facilities such as
X-ray rooms and laboratories where exposure to ionizing radiation is less than
0.5 rem per year.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
Work involving exposure to
naturally-occurring radiation such as radiation in soil or sunlight radiation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)           
Exemptions </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There
are no provisions in HO 6 for apprentices or student-learners.  There are no
other exemptions applicable to this order.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)           
Enforcement positions</p>
<p>(1)          
Compliance with the National
Committee on Radiation Protection updates and clarifications of Handbook No.
69, including compliance with the standards of 10 CFR part 20, is considered
compliance with the radiation exposure requirements of HO 6.</p>
<p>(2)          
Although HO 6 still applies, the
manufacture of products containing radium and radium compounds used to make
self-luminous parts, such as but not limited to watch dials that glow at night,
is no longer a problem.  This type of manufacturing was discontinued a number
of years ago and seldom are any products manufactured using such lumination. 
With regard to thorium salts used to make incandescent gas mantles such as
those used on Coleman Lanterns, this also is no longer an exposure problem. 
The radiation level is so low on each mantle that one would have to concentrate
hundreds of these mantles together to achieve an exposure level even
approaching a health risk. </p>

<h3>33h07.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 7—Power-Driven Hoisting Apparatus
Occupations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name: 
Occupations Involved in the Operation of Power-driven Hoisting Apparatus</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally
Adopted:  July 16, 1946</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)           
Scope of HO 7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
The investigation of occupations
involved in the operation of hoisting apparatus was initiated because of the
generally accepted belief that such equipment presented a high degree of
accident risk and was inappropriate for young workers.  Accidents have involved
improper rigging where loads have fallen on people and crushed them; persons
falling from stacked materials or down elevator shafts; and people coming into
contact with over-head electrical conductors.  These injuries not only occurred
during the operation of the equipment, but also while assisting in the
operation of hoisting apparatus.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
HO 7 originally prohibited 16- and
17-year-olds from operating (or, in some cases assisting to operate) all
power-driven hoisting apparatus which consist of elevators, cranes, derricks,
hoists and high-lift trucks and portable elevators, and tiering or piling
machines.  HO 7 is broadly written and prohibits the operation of this
equipment no matter where located.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
Revisions to HO 7 in 2010 (see FOH
33h07(b); 75 FR 28433) more broadly prohibited 16- and 17-year-olds from
operating, tending, riding upon, working from, repairing, servicing, or
disassembling such equipment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
Definitions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
The term elevator shall mean any
power-driven hoisting or lowering mechanism equipped with a car or platform
which moves in guides in a substantially vertical direction.  This term
includes both passenger and freight elevators (including portable elevators or
tiering machines), but shall not include dumbwaiters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.             
The term automatic elevator shall
mean a passenger elevator, a freight elevator, or a combination
passenger-freight elevator, the operation of which is controlled by pushbuttons
in such a manner that the starting, going to the landing selected, leveling and
holding, and the opening and closing of the car and hoistway doors are entirely
automatic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.             
The term automatic signal
operation elevator shall mean an elevator which is started in response to the
operation of a switch (such as a lever or pushbutton) in the car which when
operated by the operator actuates a starting device that automatically closes
the car and hoistway doors—from this point on, the movement of the car to the
landing selected, leveling and holding when it gets there, and the opening of
the car and hoistway doors are entirely automatic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.             
The term crane shall mean a
power-driven machine for lifting and lowering a load and moving it
horizontally, in which the hoisting mechanism is an integral part of the
machine.  This term includes all types of cranes, such as cantilever gantry,
crawler, gantry, hammerhead, ingot pouring, jib, locomotive, motor-truck,
overhead traveling, pillar jib, pintle, portal, semi-gantry, semi-portal,
storage bridge, tower, walking jib, and wall cranes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.             
The term derrick shall mean a
power-driven apparatus consisting of a mast or equivalent members held at the
top by guys or braces, with or without a boom, for use with a hoisting
mechanism or operating ropes.  This term includes all types of derricks, such
as A-frame, breast, Chicago boom, gin-pole, guy and stiff-leg derrick.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>f.              
The term hoist shall mean a
power-driven apparatus for raising or lowering a load by the application of a
pulling force that does not include a car or platform running in guides.  This
term includes all types of hoists, such as base mounted electric, clevis
suspension, hook suspension, monorail, overhead electric, simple drum and
trolley suspension hoists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>g.             
The term high-lift truck shall
mean a power-driven industrial type of truck used for lateral transportation
that is equipped with a power-operated lifting device usually in the form of a
fork or platform capable of tiering loaded pallets or skids one above the
other.  Instead of a fork or a platform, the lifting device may consist of a
ram, scoop, shovel, crane, revolving fork, or other attachments for handling
specific loads.  The term shall mean and include highlift trucks known under
such names as fork lifts, fork trucks, fork lift trucks, tiering trucks,
backhoes, front-end loaders, skid loaders, skid-steer loaders, Bobcat loaders,
or stacking trucks, but shall not mean low-lift trucks or low-lift platform
trucks that are designed for the transportation of but not the tiering of
materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>h.             
The term manlift shall mean a
device intended for the conveyance of persons that consists of platforms or
brackets mounted on, or attached to, an endless belt, cable, chain or similar
method of suspension; with such belt, cable or chain operating in a
substantially vertical direction and being supported by and driven through
pulleys, sheaves or sprockets at the top and bottom.  The term shall also
include truck- or equipment-mounted aerial platforms commonly referred to as
scissor lifts, boom-type mobile elevating work platforms, work assist vehicles,
cherry pickers, basket hoists, and bucket trucks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>i.              
The term regular operator shall
mean a person whose regular and practical duty is the operation of the
elevator.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>j.              
The term assigned operator shall
mean a person who has been specifically designated to operate the elevator. 
Such a person may be a “regular” operator.  Assigned operator may also mean a
person who is designated to operate the elevator in addition to his/her regular
job.  More than one person may be assigned to operate the same elevator.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)           
Occupations PROHIBITED</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
Work of operating, tending, riding
upon, working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling an elevator, crane,
derrick, hoist, or high-lift truck, except 16- and 17-year-olds may operate or
ride inside an unattended automatic operation passenger elevator. Tending such
equipment includes assisting in the hoisting tasks being performed by the
equipment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
Work of operating, tending, riding
upon, working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a manlift or freight
elevator, except 16- and 17-year-olds may ride upon a freight elevator operated
by an assigned operator.  Tending such equipment includes assisting in the
hoisting tasks being performed by the equipment.  CL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and
15-year-olds from operating most power-driven equipment, including “automatic”
freight elevators and automatic combination passenger/freight elevators.  Such
youth may operate and ride in fully automatic passenger elevators as found in
most office buildings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
Operator of a portable elevator or
tiering machine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
Operator of a crane or derrick.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)          
Tending, riding upon, working
from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a crane or derrick, including such
work as performed by crane hookers, crane chasers, hookers-on, riggers, rigger
helpers, and the like.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
Tending such equipment includes
assisting in the hoisting tasks being performed by the equipment.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.             
Members of an oil-well drilling
crew are considered as assisting in the operation of such equipment (see
FOH 33h07(e)(4)).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)          
Operating, tending, riding upon,
working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a hoist—including hoists
that do not exceed one-ton capacity.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
Prior to July 19, 2010, 16- and
17-year-olds were permitted to operate certain electric or air-operated hoists
that did not exceed a one ton capacity (see 75 FR 28433).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.             
This prohibition includes hoists
commonly used on tow trucks.   HO 2 prohibits minors from operating a motor
vehicle while towing another vehicle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)          
Operating, tending riding upon,
working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a high-lift truck such as
a forklift, fork truck, fork-lift truck, tiering truck, backhoe, front end
loader, skid loader, skid-steer loader, stacking truck and a Bobcat loader.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
Prior to July 19, 2010, HO 7 only prohibited
the work of operating a high-lift truck.  The 2010 Final Rule added the tasks
of tending, riding upon, working from, repairing, servicing, and disassembling
such equipment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.             
“Tending” includes assisting in
the hoisting tasks being performed by the equipment.  Minors under 18 years of
age may not be employed as “spotters” of forklifts—workers who provide signals
or cues to forklift operators to assist in the safe operation of forklifts—as
such work is “tending” (see 75 FR 28434).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.             
The prohibitions of HO 7 apply
even if the minors operating such equipment do not use or activate the
equipment’s hoisting apparatus.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.             
For example, in Lynnville
Transport, Inc. v. Chao, 316 F. Supp.2d 790 (S.D. Iowa 2004), the District
Court affirmed DOL’s position that minors who operated a skid loader as a
“scraper” to muck-out a cattle transport vehicle were still employed in
violation of HO 7 even though they never raised or lowered the shovel (the
hoisting apparatus) of the equipment.  The court cited the administrative law
judge’s reasoning that “although the minors testified that they did not lift
the shovel of the skid loader to high levels in performing their duties, the
fact that they had the opportunity to do so, either intentionally or
unintentionally, by moving the levers, placed the minors and other minors in
the area in a potentially hazardous position.” (316 F.Supp.2nd at 800).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.             
This same reasoning would prohibit
minors from simply moving such power-driven hoisting equipment from one
location to another, such as around a job site or from the back of an equipment
dealer showroom to the front of the showroom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)          
Work of operating, tending, riding
upon, working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a manlift.  The
definition of a manlift includes, since July 19, 2010, truck- or
equipment-mounted aerial platforms commonly referred to as scissor lifts,
boom-type mobile elevating work platforms, work assist vehicles, cherry
pickers, basket hoists, and bucket trucks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9)          
Operating, tending, riding upon,
working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a freight elevator, except
16- and 17-year-olds may ride on a freight elevator when the elevator is
operated by an assigned operator.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)           
Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
Automotive and truck servicing
establishments</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
“Grease rack” lifts used in
gasoline service stations, tire stores and other establishments servicing
automobiles are not “power-driven hoisting apparatus” covered by HO 7.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.             
Service jacks, hand jacks, air
compressors, tire changers, truck tire changers, and wheel balancers are all
outside the scope of HO 7.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
Operation of amusement park rides</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
The operation of amusement park
rides is not prohibited by HO 7.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.             
Although a number of rides in
amusement and theme parks have characteristics similar to certain machines that
minors under 18 years of age are prohibited from operating under HO 7, a
careful review of these rides, which have a variety of names, has concluded
that none of the machines are “derricks<a name="OLE_LINK5">”</a>, “cranes”,
“hoists”, “elevators” or “manlifts” within the meaning of the HO.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.             
Swing-type rides appear very
similar to a stiff-leg derrick or various types of cranes including a jib
crane.  However, these rides only swing or rotate and lack any hoisting
apparatus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.             
A number of roller coasters and
similar rides are connected cars operated on a rail and driven by a chain
pull.  They are not operated by hoists, nor are they considered elevators or
manlifts. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.             
Water rides often follow the flow
of the water down a trough and are repositioned at a higher level by a conveyor
belt.  Since the boats carrying the riders remain within the trough, these
rides are not considered elevators or manlifts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
Operation of motorized hand
trucks.  Motorized hand trucks, such as the Yale Low Lift Pallet-Walkie
Motorized Hand Truck, models MPW 040 and 060, are not considered to be
“high-lift trucks.”  Designed for transportation but not the tiering of
materials, they are low-lift trucks and not subject to HO 7. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
Hanglines in poultry processing
plants and dry cleaners are considered to be “chain conveyors” and are not
covered by HO 7.  These apparatus do not have hoists to raise and lower the
loads.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
Hanglines in poultry processing
plants are usually made up of a metal I-beam, a continuous chain, and shackles
attached to the chain.  The chain may be powered by an electric motor or other
means and generally runs from the loading dock or platform, through the plant
were the poultry is processed and back to the loading dock in a continuous
loop.  Crews on the platform (or sometimes in a darkened room nearby) attach
the live poultry to the shackles by their feet where they hang upside down. 
The hangline then moves to the killing area within the plant and may in the
course of its route rise or descend within the plant to different levels.  The
speed of the chain is coordinated with the loading crew’s ability to hang a
fowl on each shackle and not leave any without a bird on it. HO 11, as of July
19, 2010, prohibits the employment of youth under 18 in most occupations in or
about poultry slaughtering and processing establishments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.             
Hanglines in dry cleaners that
hold finished garments to be picked up operate in a similar manner as the
hanglines in poultry processing plants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)          
“Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
The “Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART”
are two types of machines often used by grocers and other retail stores to move
large strings of shopping carts.  These machines are hooked to the last
shopping cart in a string and then the operator guides the string of carts back
to the store while commanding the machine to move by means of a hand-held
remote control.  The operator walks behind the machine and operates the manual
throttle when returning to the parking lot to collect more carts.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.             
These machines do not fall within
the definitions of any of the hoists prohibited by HO 7; nor are these machines
considered to be “motor vehicles” as defined in HO 2.  Sixteen- and 17-year-old
minors are permitted to operate these machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.             
Since the “Cart Caddy” and
“QuicKART” are both power-driven machines, 29 CFR 570.33(b) would prohibit
14- and 15-year-olds from operating or tending such machines (see
FOH 33c06(e)(5)).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)           
Exemptions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
There is no provision in HO 7 for
apprentices or student-learners.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may
operate an automatic elevator and an automatic signal operation elevator
provided that all the following conditions have been met:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
The exposed portion of the car
interior, the car door, and the hoistway doors are constructed of solid
surfaces without any opening through which a part of the body may extend,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.             
All hoistway openings at floor
level have doors which are interlocked with the car door so as to prevent the
car from starting until all such doors are closed and locked,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.             
The elevator is equipped with a
device which will stop and hold the car in case of overspeed or if the cable
slackens or breaks, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.             
The elevator is equipped with
upper and lower travel limit devices which will normally bring the car to rest
at either terminal and a final limit switch which will prevent the movement in
either direction and will open in case of excessive over travel by the car.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)           
Enforcement positions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)          
Chair-lifts at ski resorts</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chair-lifts
at ski resorts which operate in a substantially vertical direction – where the
lifts travel in a vertical direction that is greater than the horizontal
distance traveled – are manlifts subject to HO 7 and may not be operated by
minors under 18 years of age. Those chair-lifts which travel a greater distance
horizontally than vertically are outside the scope of HO 7.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)          
Airport baggage handling equipment</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
A conveyor belt loader is a
wheeled vehicle, equipped with a movable conveyor belt, used to load and unload
individual baggage items from the cargo hold of aircraft.  The front end of the
conveyor is raised and lowered by a hydraulic piston located under the conveyor
belt.  The operation of the conveyor belt loader is not prohibited by HO 7.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.             
A canister loader truck is a
wheeled vehicle with a lifting device which moves baggage between the terminal
and the aircraft.  Baggage is placed in canisters which hold 50 to 70 bags and
suitcases.  The canisters are then pushed onto the bed of the loader which is
equipped with rollers.  The canisters are rolled onto the loader and are rolled
off onto the plane.  Most of the time this function is automated, however,
sometimes hand loading and/or unloading of the canisters is required.  The load
is raised and lowered by hydraulics to and from the ground level to the cargo
hold of the airplane.  The reverse process takes place during the unloading of
the plane.  Canister loader trucks are high-lift trucks as defined in
29 CFR 570.58(b) and therefore HO 7 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds
from operating, loading and unloading such equipment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)          
Power winches</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WH
has opined since as early as 1961 that HO 7 prohibits minors under the age of
18 from operating power winches, including those affixed to tow trucks or wrecker
trucks.  Although HO 7 does not specifically state that winches are covered,
the HO does state that the term “hoist” shall mean a power-driven apparatus for
raising or lowering a load by the application of a pulling force that does not
include a car or platform running in guides.  The definition further adds that
the term shall include all types of hoists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)          
Drilling rig crews  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Members
of a well drilling crew are considered as assisting in the operation of hoists
and therefore fall under the provisions of HO 7.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)          
Assisting in the operation of
power-driven patient/resident hoists or lifts              </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.             
WHD issued a Final Rule on May 20,
2010, which removed from HO 7 the exemption that allowed 16- and 17-year-olds
to operate air or electric powered hoists that did not exceed a lift capacity
of one ton (see 75 Fed. Reg. 28404, 28434 (May 20, 2010)). With
the elimination of that exemption, minors under the age of 18 were prohibited
from operating or assisting in operating all power-driven hoists in any workplace,
including power-driven hoists/lifts used to elevate and transport
patients/residents in hospitals, nursing homes, and residences. 
Prohibited equipment includes floor-based vertical powered patient/resident
lift devices; ceiling-mounted vertical powered patient/resident lift devices;
and powered sit-to-stand patient/resident lift devices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.             
On July 13, 2011, WHD issued Field
Assistance Bulletin (FAB) 2011-3 (Assisting in the operation of
power-driven patient/resident hoists/lifts Under the Child Labor Provisions of
the Fair Labor Standards Act) which states that WH will not charge a child
labor violation when properly trained 16- and 17-year-olds, under specific
conditions, assist a trained adult in the operation of power-driven
patient/resident lifts/hoists.  The FAB is available at
http://www.dol.gov/whd/FieldBulletins/index.htm. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.             
WH will exercise its enforcement discretion, and not assert
child labor violations involving 16- and 17-year-olds who assist a trained
adult worker in the operation of floor-based vertical powered patient/resident
lift devices, ceiling-mounted vertical powered patient/resident lift devices,
and powered sit-to-stand patient/resident lift devices only when all of the
following conditions are met: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.             
The child (16- or 17-year-old) has
successfully completed the 75 clock hours of nurses aide training required by
the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act from the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, as outlined in 42 CFR
§ 483.152, or a higher state standard where applicable, and has
successfully completed the nurses aide competency evaluation detailed in 42
CFR 483.154, or a higher state standard where applicable.  WHD will not
assert a violation of HO 7 when 16- and 17-year-olds engage in the limited
operation of patient lifts as required by this nursing aide training.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.             
The child is not operating by
himself or herself floor-based vertical powered patient/resident lift devices,
ceiling-mounted vertical powered patient/resident lift devices, and powered
sit-to-stand patient/resident lift devices and the child is assisting in the
use of lifting devices as a junior member of at least a two-person team that is
headed by an employee who is at least 18 years of age.  All members of the team
must be trained in the safe operation of the lifting devices being used.       </p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.             
As a junior member of the team, the child may set up, move, position,
and secure unoccupied lifting devices.  The child may assist trained adult
employees in attaching slings to and un-attaching slings from lifting devices
prior to and after the lift/transfer of the patient/resident is
completed.  The child may also assist trained adult employees in operating
the controls that activate the power to lift/transfer the patient/resident. 
The child may act as a spotter/observer and may position items such as a chair,
wheelchair, bed, and commode under the patient/resident who is being
lifted/transferred.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.             
As a junior member of
the team, the child may not independently engage in “hands on” physical contact
with the patient/resident during the lifting/transferring process (such as
placing or removing the sling, including pushing or pulling the sling
under/around the patient/resident; adjusting the sling under/around the
patient/resident; and manipulating the patient/resident when placing, adjusting
or removing a sling under/around the patient/resident), and may only assist in
these “hands on” activities when assisting a trained adult employee while the
adult employee is simultaneously engaged in such activities.  The child may
similarly assist a trained adult employee who is manipulating, guiding,
rotating, or otherwise maneuvering the patient while the patient is being
lifted/transferred.  In addition, the child may similarly assist a trained
adult employee who is pushing, pulling or rotating lifting devices when the
device is engaged in the process of lifting/transferring a patient/resident.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5.             
The child is not injured while
operating or assisting in the operation of a lifting device.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6.             
The employer has provided to each
16- and 17-year-old who will assist in the operation of lifting devices a copy
of the document that was forwarded with this Field Assistance Bulletin as
Attachment A.  Attachment A advised the young worker of what tasks he or she
may and may not perform while assisting in the operation of a power-driven
patient/resident lift/hoist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.             
The above enforcement position
will not apply when WH determines that a 16- or 17-year-old employee has
assisted in the operation of a power-driven patient/resident lifting device and
the requirements discussed in paragraphs 1 through 6 above have not been
met.  In such instances, WH will charge appropriate child labor violations
and the employer will be subject to the assessment of child labor civil money
penalties as permitted by FLSA section 16(e)(1). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.             
As noted in paragraph 5 above,
this enforcement policy is also not applicable if a child is injured while
operating or assisting in the operation of power-driven patient hoists/lifts. 
If a child is injured while engaged in such activities, even if the child was
employed in compliance with this nonenforcement policy, WH will generally
charge a violation of HO 7 and assess a civil money penalty.  Notwithstanding
this enforcement policy, WHD will investigate reports of children being injured
while assisting in the operation of power-driven patient hoists/lifts, as well
as complaints that the employer has not complied with the requirements in
paragraphs 1 through 6 above.</p>

<h3>33h08.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 8—Power-Driven Metal Forming, Punching,
and Shearing Machine Occupations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name:  Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven metal
forming, punching, and shearing machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally Adopted:  October 30, 1950</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 8</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The report establishing HO 8 concluded that
metal-forming, punching and shearing machines are dangerous because they
utilize a heavy crushing or powerful cutting action to perform their work, and
because the operator is required in many cases to place his or her hands close
to the point of operation in feeding them.  Even with guards and better feeding
methods, the report continued, these machines are extremely dangerous.  In
light of the preceding and the fact that state child labor laws varied greatly
and did not reflect “an awareness of the hazards of operating” these machines,
the report recommended the establishment of HO 8. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 8 is machine specific and it prohibits the
operation, helping to operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or
cleaning power-driven metal forming, punching, and shearing machines.  The
scope of this HO is narrow and does not include a very large group of metal
working machines known as machine tools. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Definitions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The term operator shall mean a
person who operates a machine covered by this HO by performing such functions
as starting or stopping the machine, placing materials into or removing them
from the machine, or any other functions directly involved in operation of the
machine. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The term helper shall mean a
person who assists in the operation of a machine covered by this HO by helping
place materials into or removing them from the machine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The term forming, punching, and
shearing machines shall mean power-driven metal-working machines, other than
machine tools, which change the shape of or cut metal by means of tools, such
as dies, rolls, or knives which are mounted on rams, plungers, or other moving
parts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
A rolling machine is a machine
used to change the size or shape of metal by running it between rolls under
pressure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
The term pressing or punching
machines shall mean any machine falling within one of the three following types
of machines:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
A punch press is a machine fitted
with a ram or plunger and a die for the purpose of blanking, trimming, drawing,
punching, or stamping metal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
A power press is a large, slow
acting press which performs an operation similar to a punch press, but is intended
to handle very large or very heavy work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
A plate punch is a machine for
punching holes (such as for rivets) in heavy metal plate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A.   
A bending machine is a machine for
bending metal plate between a stationary bed and a moving ram (metal bending
machines are known as brakes). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>B.   
A hammering machine is a machine
which employs a ram or plunger to pound the material being worked on into the
desired shape.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>C.   
A shearing machine is a machine
for cutting metal by the shearing action of a movable blade or blades.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>D.   
A guillotine shear is a machine
used for cutting heavy metal plates which consists of a movable upper blade and
a stationary lower blade.  The upper blade comes down vertically to meet the
lower stationary blade.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>E.   
An alligator shear is a machine
used for cutting barstock which consists of a movable upper blade and a
stationary lower blade operating like scissors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>F.    
A circular shear is a machine with
revolving disks which cut the material when it passes through the point where
the revolving disks meet.  It is used for cutting light metal sheets such as
those used in tin cans.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>G.   
Machine tools are power-driven
complete metal-working machines having one or more tool-or work-holding
devices, and are used for progressively removing metal in the form of chips. 
The following are the five principal types of machine tools classified by their
function:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>i.     
Milling machine tools consist of
machining a piece of metal by bringing it into contact with a rotating cutter
with multiple cutting edges. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>ii.    
Planing machine tools consists of
machining a surface by moving the work back and forth under a stationary
cutting tool. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>iii.  
Turning machine tools consists of
shaping a rotating piece by means of a cutting tool to generate a cylindrical
surface. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>iv.  
Boring machine tools consists of
cutting a round hole by means of a rotating cutting tool. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>v.    
Grinding machine tools consists of
shaping a piece by bringing it into contact with a rotating abrasive wheel.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>(1)  Occupations as an operator of or as helper on a punch
press equipped with full automatic feed and ejection with a fixed barrier guard
to prevent the hands or fingers of the operator from entering the area between
the dies, power presses, and plate punches. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 8 does not apply to the operation of machine
tools.  The following is a list of machine tools classified by function:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Milling machines:  horizontal
milling machines, vertical milling machines, universal milling machines,
planer-type milling machines, gear cutting machines, profilers, routers, and
circular saws (Circular saws are subject to HO 14). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Planing machines:  planers,
shapers, slotters, broaches, keyseaters, hack and band saws (All band saws are
subject to HO 14). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Turning machines:  engine lathes,
turret lathes, hollow spindle lathes, automatic lathes, and automatic screw
machines. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Boring machines:  vertical boring
mills, horizontal boring mills, jig borers, drilling machines, pedestal drills,
radial drills, gang drills, upright drills, drill presses, multiple spindle
drills, centering machines, reamers, and honers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
Grinding machines:  grinders,
abrasive wheels, abrasive belts, abrasive discs, abrasive points, buffing
wheels, polishing wheels, stroppers, and lapping machines (Abrasive cutting
discs are subject to HO 14).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is a provision in HO 8 for apprentices and student-learners. 
There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The following is a list of power-driven machines that
have been determined to be covered by HO 8:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Automatic Bulkan Assembler (the
Bulkan).  This power-driven machine performs a bending or crimping action on
metal and is covered by HO 8.  The machine attaches pre-formed metal edged
paper disks to the top and bottom of cylindrical paper sidewalls.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Hager press.  This hydraulic
press, designed to install a broad range of fasteners in flat or pre-formed
sheet metal assemblies, is covered by HO 8. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Metal bottom seamer . This
power-driven machine performs a rolling and bending action on metal and is
covered under HO 8.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The following is a list of power-driven machines that
have been determined not to be covered by HO 8:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Wheel crusher or rim removing
machine . This machine separates a rim from a tire by using three dies attached
to three rams to bend the tire and the metal rim.  The rim is circular metal
structure specially formed to fit the shape of a wheel, and not a metal plate
or a flat piece of (sheet) metal as required by the HO.  Moreover, the purpose
of the machine is to separate the tire from its rim and not to form the rim
into another shape (which would be the purpose of a bending machine).  In light
of the preceding, a wheel crusher is not a bending machine, or any other kind
of metal forming, punching and shearing machine, and it is not covered by
HO 8. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Walco Precision Roller (series 60
and 67).  This machine is used to coat metal and other materials with paint,
various adhesives, and other substances.  The machine does not form, shape, or
reduce the thickness of metal (the function of a rolling machine) and it is not
covered by HO 8. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Injection molding press.  When
used to manufacture plastic parts (as opposed to cutting or shaping metal),
this machine is not covered by HO 8. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Flox wire cut electrical discharge
machine.  This machine cuts metal using a brass wire as an electrode.  When the
wire is brought near metal, an arc is created eroding the metal.  Since this
technology does not cut or shape metal with tools mounted on rams, plungers, or
other moving parts, it is not a power-driven metal forming, punching or
shearing machine, and is not covered by HO 8.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The following is a list of machine tools which are not
covered by HO 8:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     Key Duplicating Machines.
These machines, often located in hardware stores and other retail
establishments, duplicate keys by using a metal cutter.  These machines are
machine tools and therefore outside the scope of HO 8.  An example of a key
duplicating machine that has been determined to be a machine tool is the Axxess
PC key machine (serial #0595187FP).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Ridgid 535 pipe and bolt
threading machine. This machine is classified as machine tool and not a
shearing machine, even though the cutting knife has a rotary motion.  Since it is
a machine tool, it is not covered by HO 8. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     Landis pipe nipple and
automatic pipe nipple machines. These machines are considered to be machine
tools and not covered under HO 8. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.     Brake drum and brake
disc lathes .These lathes (used to repair brakes in automotive and truck repair
shops) are turning machines and are considered machine tools.  They are outside
the scope of HO 8.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.     Pipe threading equipment.
Turning machines, such as the Rigid Model 1234 Threading Machine, are machine
tools and not covered under HO 8.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33h09.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 9—Occupations in Mining, Other Than
Coal.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name:  Occupations in Connection with Mining, Other than
Coal</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally Adopted:  January 6, 1951</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 9</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Prior to the enactment of HO 9, only coal
mining (HO 3) was covered by a hazardous occupations order.  Since the issuance
of HO 9, all mining, with the exception of mining in the petroleum and natural
gas industries, falls within the scope of a hazardous occupations order.  An
investigation of the mining industry concluded, in an April 1950 report, that
all work in this industry involved an “exceptionally high degree of accident
risk” and the employment of young people should be prohibited in the vast
majority of mining occupations.  Moreover, the report cited inadequate state
child labor laws, which in many instances allowed children as young as 14 years
of age to work in underground mines, as an additional reason for establishing
HO 9.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 9 is industry specific.  It applies to
metal mines, nonmetal mines, ore-dressing plants, quarries, clay pits and clay
mines, and sand and gravel operations.  In terms of product mined, the HO
covers:  iron, copper, lead, zinc, and other metals, barite, gypsum, salt,
sulfur, and other nonmetals, limestone, marble, granite, and other minerals. 
Its scope includes all occupations in connection with mining, other than coal,
with the exception of certain surface occupations not directly concerned with
the extraction or haulage of the mined material.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Many occupations prohibited by HO 9 may
also be prohibited by other HOs.  Examples include operating motor-vehicles (HO
2), using a power-driven chain saw to cut timber (HO 5), and operating some
earth moving equipment while working in a tunnel (HO 17).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  HO 9 does not cover work in coal mines
which is prohibited by HO 3; in petroleum production; or in the production of
natural-gas.  The HO also does not prohibit work involving most manufacturing
or processing operations applied to the extracted materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Definitions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The term all
occupations in connection with mining, other than coal shall mean:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
All work performed
underground in mines and quarries; on the surface at underground mines and
underground quarries; in or about open-cut mines, open quarries, clay pits, and
sand and gravel operations; at or about placer mining operations; at or about
dredging operations for clay, sand or gravel; at or about bore-hole mining
operations; in or about all metal mills, washer plants, or grinding mills
reducing the bulk of the extracted minerals and at or about any other crushing,
grinding, screening, sizing, washing or cleaning operations performed upon the
extracted minerals except when those operations are performed as part of a
manufacturing process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
The term shall not
include work performed in subsequent manufacturing or processing operations,
such as work performed in:  smelters, electro-metallurgical plants, refineries,
reduction plants, cement mills, plants where quarried stone is cut, sanded and
further processed, or plants manufacturing clay, glass, or ceramic products. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
Neither shall the term
include work performed in connection with coal mining (see HO 3,
FOH 33h03),
in petroleum production, in natural-gas production, nor in dredging operations
which are not a part of mining operations, such as dredging for construction or
navigation purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The term placer mining
shall mean the mining of a placer deposit (a surface deposit of loose particles
of certain heavy minerals—frequently gold) utilizing the following methods:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
Placer dredging
operations – Operating in a pond, a placer dredge (a kind of floating washer
plant) utilizes a series of buckets connected by a chain to scoop gravel from
the bottom of the pond.  The dredge is also equipped with machinery to recover
the heavy metal from the gravel and dispose of the refuse. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
Surface placer
operations – This method, often called sluicing, requires a source of water
large enough to make a fast-flowing stream in a sluice box.  At the upper end
of the sluice there is a screen onto which gravel is shoveled or dumped.  Water
runs over the gravel on the screen, washing the fine gravel through it, and the
heavy metal is caught on a bar fastened across bottom of the sluice box.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
Hydraulic placer
operations – In this method, a powerful stream of water is used to break down
earth and rock and guide the particles through channels into long sluices. 
Diesel power is used extensively for pumps, tractors, or for drag lines, and
some operations use tractors equipped with a blade to push the material to the
sluice box.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The term bore-hole
mining shall mean a method of recovering some minerals (most notably sulfur and
salt) by pumping compressed air into the holes bored down to the deposit to
force the mineral to the surface.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
The term metal mill
operations shall mean a highly automated operation requiring few employees
consisting of three distinct steps:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
Preparation (crushing,
grinding, cleaning, and classifying), </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
Separation (jigging,
tabling, heavy-media separation, and froth flotation), and </p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
Finishing (including
settling, filtering, drying, and otherwise preparing the concentrates for
shipment).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
The term washer plant
operations shall mean an operation performed to the ore after it is mined to
remove clay and dirt form the solids.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>f.     
The term grinding mill
operations shall mean the reduction of the concentrate into a powder form at a
grinding mill.  This operation that occurs after the ore is cleansed at a
washer plant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Occupations
PROHIBITED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  All occupations involving underground work
in mines or underground quarries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  All surface occupations at underground
mines unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(1).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  All occupations involving work in or about
open cut mines, open quarries (including crushing, screening, and washing),
clay pits (including dredging), and sand and gravel operations (including
dredging, washing, and screening), unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  All occupations involving work at or about
placer mining and bore-hole mining operations, unless otherwise permitted by
FOH 33h09(c)(1).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  All occupations involving work in metal
mills, unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  All occupations involving work in washer
plants or grinding mills, unless otherwise permitted by FOH 33h09(c)(1).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT
SPECIFICALLY BANNED</b></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>(1)  The following occupations are permitted
for 16- and 17- year-olds when performed at the surface of underground mines;
in or about open pit mines, open quarries, clay pits and sand and grave
operations; in surface placer mines, including placer dredging operations,
hydraulic placer mining operations and bore-hole mining operations; and in
washer plants or grinding mills:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Work in offices, in
the warehouse or supply house, in the change house, in the laboratory, and in
repair or maintenance shops not located underground.  In the case of open
quarries and other types of open-pit operations, this work is permitted in the
pit or quarry proper, but not outside of the building itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Work in the operation
and maintenance of living quarters (Some of this work may be prohibited by
another HO).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Work outside of the
mine in surveying, in the repair and maintenance of roads, and in general
clean-up about the mine property (such as clearing brush and digging drainage
ditches).  This work is not permitted when done underground or in an open
quarry or pit.  For example, maintenance of roads in an open-cut mine would
only be allowed if it was done outside of the open-cut.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The following work is permitted in metal mills:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Work involving the operation of
jigs, sludge tables, flotation cells, or drier-filters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Hand-sorting work at picking table
or a picking belt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
General clean-up work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Work of track crews in the building
and maintenance of railroad tracks located in an area of an open-cut metal
mine, if haulage and mining activities are not being conducted where the track
crew is working.  This exception applies only to metal mines, since such
operations are vast in scale, much of the track work is physically removed from
the extractive operation, and the track crew can work without undue exposure to
hazard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
The only work permitted in
mercury-recovery mills or mills using the cyanide process is the kind of work
stated in FOH 33h09(c)(1) above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are no provisions in HO 9 for apprentices or
student-learners.  There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement
positions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Peat moss</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO 9 does
not apply to cutting, gathering, piling or any other occupation performed on
peat moss.  Peat moss is defined as partially decomposed sphagnum;
consequently, it is not a mineral within the meaning of this order and any
activities performed on it or to it would not be “occupations in connection with
mining.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Motor-vehicle operator and outside helper</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO 9
prohibits almost all work in or about a mine, which would include the
occupations of motor-vehicle driver and outside helper.  HO 2 also specifically
prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from performing the occupations of motor-vehicle
driver and outside helper in or about any mine, including an open pit mine or
quarry.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Weighing trucks</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
weighing of trucks filled with gravel, crushed stone, or other minerals is
prohibited by HO 9.  This work is prohibited even if the minors spend only a
small percentage of their time weighing trucks and the majority of their work
is confined to an office environment.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Processing stockpiled limestone into lime</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO 9 does
not apply to occupations involved in the processing of stockpiled limestone
into hydrated lime.  This process is deemed to be manufacturing and not mining
(the crushed stockpiled limestone is heated at extreme temperatures to create
quicklime, water is then added to the quicklime to make hydrated lime which is
shipped to the consumer).  The prohibitions of HO 9 would cease to apply when
the extracted, crushed, and screened limestone was stockpiled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Railroad track work</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Track work
performed three miles from the open quarry is not an occupation prohibited by
HO 9 as the work is not in close proximity to the mining haulage or to mining
activities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Processing marble into a finished building
product</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The prohibitions of HO
9 apply to occupations in the processing of marble into a finished building
material when it involves the following steps:  the marble is quarried, run
through a primary crusher, through a secondary crusher or grinding operation, and
then into elevated storage bins.  The finished product is loaded from these
bins into bulk trucks or it is sacked and stored for later shipment.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>b.     </b>This process is not deemed to be
manufacturing since the marble has not been chemically changed and nothing was
manufactured from the crushed marble (i.e. bricks, blocks, tile, etc.)</p>

<h3>33h10.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 10—Slaughtering, Meat- and Poultry-Packing,
Processing and Rendering.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Occupations in the operation of power-driven meat-processing machines
and occupations involving slaughtering, meat and poultry packing, processing,
or rendering.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally Adopted:  May 8, 1952</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 10</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Meat-packing was one of the most hazardous industries
at the time HO 10 was promulgated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics issued
Bulletin No. 855 (Injuries and Accident Causes in the Slaughtering and
Meat-Packing Industries, 1943), which documented the hazards in this industry. 
Dangers included slips and falls on slippery floors, injuries from live
animals, strains from overlifting, cutting hazards from sharp knives, and
injuries from power-driven equipment.  More recent publications issued by the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) confirm the
continued existence of these hazards and also cite the danger of steam burns,
electric shock, and ergonomic injuries and illnesses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 10 originally applied only to occupations in the
slaughtering, rendering, and meat packing industries.  When Congress amended
the FLSA in 1961 to cover certain retail and service enterprises, WH amended HO
10 to cover work in such firms.  Thus, HO 10 applies both on an industry basis
(slaughtering, rendering, and meat-packing) and to the use of certain
power-driven meat-processing machines (including meat slicers) whenever located
in covered establishments and regardless of the material being processed.  In
1981, HO 10 was again amended to clarify that restaurants, fast-food
establishments, and other retail and service establishments are subject to
HO 10 and that 16- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from using power-driven
meat processing equipment in those establishments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  HO 10 was amended in 1960 to add the occupations of
setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning certain power-driven
meat-processing machines.  Prior to this, only the occupations of operating or
feeding the various named machines were prohibited by HO 10.  The 2010
revisions to HO 10 clarified that youth under 18 may not clean power-driven
meat processing equipment, including the disassembled parts.  This is true even
if the equipment is disassembled and reassembled by an adult.  Such youth may
operate a commercial dishwasher to run a self-contained rack containing parts
of or attachments to a power-driven meat processing machine through the
dishwasher as long as the youth does not actually handle or touch the machine
parts or attachments (see 75 FR 28435, see also § 570.61(a)(4)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  HO 10 was revised in 2010 and its prohibitions were
extended to the slaughtering and processing of poultry.  The term slaughtering
and meat packing establishments was redefined to include places where poultry,
buffalo, or deer, are killed, butchered, or processed.  The term now also
includes establishments which manufacture or process meat or poultry products including
sausage or sausage casings from animals (see 75 FR 28434, see also
§ 570.61(b)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  HO 10 does not apply to the killing and processing of
rabbits or small game in areas physically separated from the “killing floor”,
or in separate establishments.  It also does not apply to fish and seafood
processing plants.  These establishments were not included in the original
study of meat-packing plants, were specifically excluded from the Order when it
was issued, and amendments to the HO have not incorporated these
establishments.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Definitions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The term retail/wholesale or
service establishments includes establishments where meat or meat products,
including poultry, are processed or handled, such as butcher shops, grocery
stores, restaurants and quick service food establishments, hotels,
delicatessens, and meat-locker (freezer-locker) companies, and establishments
where any food product is prepared or processed for serving to customers using
machines prohibited by this HO.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The term slaughtering and
meat-packing establishments means places in or about which such animals as
cattle, calves, hogs, poultry, sheep, lambs, goats, buffalo, deer, or horses
are killed, butchered, or processed.  The term also includes establishments which
manufacture or process meat products or sausage casings from such animals. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The term rendering plants means
establishments engaged in the conversion of dead animals, animal offal, animal
fats, scrap meats, blood, and bones into stock feeds, tallow, inedible greases,
fertilizer ingredients, and similar products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
The term killing floor includes a
workroom, workplace where such animals as cattle, calves, hogs, poultry, sheep,
lambs, goats, buffalo, deer, or horses are immobilized, shackled, or killed, and
the carcasses are dressed prior to chilling.  The killing floor does not
include coolers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
The term curing cellar includes a
workroom or workplace which is primarily devoted to the preservation and
flavoring of meat, including poultry, by curing materials.  It does not include
a workroom or workplace solely where meats are smoked.  The curing cellar may
be located above or below ground.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>f.     
The term hide cellar includes a
workroom or workplace where hides are graded, trimmed, salted, and otherwise
cured.  The hide cellar may be located above or below ground.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>g.    
The term boning occupations means
the removal of bones from meat cuts.  It does not include work that involves
cutting, scraping, or trimming meat from cuts containing bones.</p>

occupations of operating, feeding, setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or
cleaning power-driven bacon-slicing machines and belly-rolling machines.  The
term “bacon-slicing machine” as used in HO 10 refers to those machines which
are designed solely for the purpose of slicing bacon and are equipped with
enclosure or barrier guards that prevent the operator from coming in contact
with the blade or blades, and with devices for automatic feeding, slicing,
shingling, stacking, and conveying the sliced bacon away from the point of
operation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO 10 does contain an exemption for apprentices and student-learners. 
No other exemptions are applicable to this order.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Application of HO 10 to handling of hot
oils</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The original HO 10
banned, among other things, employment of minors in occupations involved in the
recovery of lard and oils from slaughtered animals, and the rendering of animal
fat.  When Congress amended the FLSA in 1961 to cover certain retail and
service enterprises, the Department of Labor amended HO 10 to extend to retail
establishments, including fast food and full-service restaurants.  Many such
restaurants use commercial deep-fat fryers which have various attachments or
built-in features to facilitate the refining and/or recycling of cooking fats
or oils.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The refining, removing
and/or recycling of cooking fats or oils in restaurants is not a process of
“rendering” or “recovery” as described in the original HO 10 (see
29 CFR 570.61(a)(2) and (3)); neither is such refining, removing
and/or recycling of cooking fats or oils covered by any other provision of HO
10.  Furthermore, there was no specific change in the FLSA in 1961 to indicate
any Congressional intent to include within the HO 10 prohibition, the handling
of cooking fats or oils in restaurants.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Consequently, HO 10
does not prohibit minors under age 18 from being employed to clean such
restaurant machines, to remove cooking fats or oils from them, or to clean the
screening or filtering equipment.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
However, CL Reg 3 does
prohibit 14- and 15-year-olds from cleaning kitchen equipment (not otherwise
prohibited), removing oil or grease filters, pouring oil or grease through
filters, and moving receptacles containing hot grease or hot oil, when the
equipment, surfaces, containers, and liquids exceed a temperature of 100 °F
(see FOH 33c05(b)(1)a.).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Application of HO 10 to power-driven meat processing
machines and bakery machines with attachments</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
A meat slicer with a chute
attachment for processing hard-to-handle foods is covered by HO 10 as long as
the meat-cutting blades are used, even though only non-meat items are being
processed.  Consequently, a 16- or 17-year-old may not operate, dismantle,
reassemble, or clean this machine.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
“Food processors” are prohibited
if used to process meat.  Likewise, bakery machines such as vertical dough
mixers that have meat-processing attachments are covered by HO 10 when used to
process meat; and HO 11 when used to process dough. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Cleaning of power-driven meat-processing
machines </p>
<p>a.    
HO 10 prohibits minors under 18
years of age from cleaning power-driven meat processing machines.  This
prohibition includes the cleaning of the individual parts of such machines,
including the blades—even if the machine is dismantled and reassembled by an
adult (see 29 CFR 570.61(a)(4)).  However, such youth may operate a dishwasher
to run a self-contained rack containing such individual parts through the
dishwasher if the youth does not handle or touch the parts (see FOH
33h10(a)(3)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
29 CFR 570.33(e) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations which involve operating, tending,
setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing power-driven food slicers
and grinders, food choppers, food processors, food cutters, and food mixers.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Power-driven machines determined to be subject to HO
10:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Food processors when used to process
meats.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Food grinders, pureeing wands, and
mixers if designed to be used or used on meat.  This same equipment could be
prohibited by HO 11 if used to mix items such as batter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Meat choppers when used to grind
or chop cheese or other products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Liver-skinning machine used to
skin squid or other seafood products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
Meat-slicers with tubular feeding
attachments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Power-driven machines determined not to be subject to
HO 10:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Meat tenderizers and meat cubers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Food processors with attachments
used only for processing vegetables.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Lightweight, small capacity,
portable, countertop mixers discussed in § 570.62(b)(1) and in
FOH 33h11(d) when not used to process meat).   </p>

Vegetable slicers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>g.    
Colton Granulator used to force
products through a set of grinder bars and forces the reduced sized products
through a preset mesh screen (i.e. granulator is not a meat grinder).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33h11.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 11—Power Driven Bakery Machine Occupations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name:  Occupations Involved in the Operation of Bakery Machines</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally Adopted:  July 21, 1952</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 11 </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Historically, many occupational injuries occurring in
bakeries are caused by a few specific machines.  These injuries are often
serious, producing a disproportionate share of deaths or permanent
disabilities.  HO 11 was issued to prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from operating
certain power-driven bakery machines.  This HO is machine-specific as discussed
in FOH 33h00.  The operation by 16- and 17-year-olds of other bakery machines
not specifically prohibited by the order, while not encouraged, is permitted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  This order became effective prior to the 1961 and 1966
FLSA amendments which brought many previously uncovered retail bakeries and
stores under the CL provisions.  Some machines prohibited by HO 11 are found in
retail bakeries, pizzerias, restaurants and other food service establishments –
others are only found in wholesale bakeries.  Violations often occur in small
bakeries where there is little division of labor and most jobs are performed by
all employees.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The scope of this order includes, among other
activities, operating, assisting to operate and cleaning the named machines
wherever found in a covered establishment.  Manually operated (not
power-driven) machines are outside the scope of HO 11.  Assisting to operate
the named machines includes the loading of ingredients into the machines – such
as the placing of flour into a mixer – even when the machines are “turned off”
when the loading is performed.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  HO 11 was revised in the 2010 Final Rule to include
two exceptions related to certain lightweight, counter-top food mixers and
certain pizza-dough rollers (see FOH 33h11(d)(2) and (d)(3)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sixteen- and 17-year-olds are prohibited from operating, assisting to
operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning the following
power-driven bakery machines:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Horizontal dough mixer—a horizontal cylinder with a
horizontal shaft with mixing arms; revolves to mix the flour with water, yeast,
salt, etc. to make dough.  This prohibition includes operating a dough
auger/feeder used to process masa for tortillas or tamales.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Vertical dough mixer—a large bowl in which a vertical
spindle with paddles attached mixes flour, water, etc. to make dough (often
used in small bakery and some pizzerias).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Batter mixer—very similar to vertical dough mixer,
except different shaped paddles are used; often used for making cake batter. 
Power-driven “wands” used to mix items such as batters are also prohibited.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Bread and/or roll dividing, rounding, or molding
machines—in the past, separate machines performed the operation of dividing,
rounding, and molding of dough for bread and rolls.  More modern machines are
multifunctional and may perform two or all three of these operations.  The
process involves cutting dough into lumps (for one loaf or batch of rolls),
rolling each lump into a ball, and after “proofing”, forming a loaf or a batch
of rolls.  The operation is often continuous, dough being carried from one
machine to another by conveyor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Dough brake—a machine which rolls dough into sheets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Dough sheeter—a machine which rolls dough into very
thin sheets.  This prohibition includes pizza dough rollers and tortilla
roller/molders (also called moulders); but see special exception for operators
of pizza dough rollers discussed in FOH 33h11(d)(3).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  Combination bread-slicing and wrapping machine—a
machine that slices a loaf of bread and wraps it in a continuous process
(generally only found in large, wholesale type bakeries).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)  Cake cutting band saw—a machine for cutting baked
cakes into squares or rectangles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9)  Cookie and cracker machine—combination machines which
form cookies or crackers from dough.  The operation is continuous, dough
entering at one end and complete cookies or crackers, ready for baking,
emerging at the other end.  Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may serve on a cookie and
cracker machine crew which actually operates the machine while producing
cookies or crackers.  These minors, however, may not set up or adjust these
machines (see FOH 33h11(c)(7)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are a number of occupations involving the operation of
power-driven machines in industrial and retail bakeries that are permitted for
16-and 17-year-old minors, including the following: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Ingredient preparation and mixing—flour-sifting
machine operator, flour-blending machine operator and sack-cleaning machine
operator.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Product forming and shaping—batter-sealing machine
operator, depositing machine operator, cookie or cracker machine crew member
(but not involving the setting up or adjusting of the machine), wafer machine
operator, pretzel-stick machine operator, pie-dough sealing machine operator,
pie-dough rolling machine operator, pie-crimping machine operator, and wedge
press operator.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
A wedge press is a machine that
uses two plates, often one of which is heated, to press balls of dough into the
desired shape.  Such presses are often used to shape tortillas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Because the original study that
led to HO 11 did not address such presses which do not utilize “rollers,” and
subsequent rulemaking did not expand the scope of the HO in this respect, HO 11
does not prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from operating such machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Finishing and Icing—depositing machine operator,
enrobing machine operator, spray machine operator, icing mixing machine
operator.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Slicing and Wrapping –roll slicing and wrapping
machine operator, cake wrapping machine operator, carton packing and sealing
machine operator. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Pan washing—spray-type pan washing machine operator,
tumbler-type pan washing machine operator.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Donut and pastry filling—donut and pastry filling
machines, including Homogenette and similar machines which automatically inject
fillings into donuts and pastries. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  Cookie or Cracker Machine Crew Member—Sixteen- and
17-year-olds may work on a crew operating a cookie or cracker machine.  These
machines, found in some wholesale bakeries, usually require crews of two to six
persons.  But minors may not perform work involving the setting up or adjusting
of the cookie or cracker machine.  These tasks, more hazardous than the
operation of the machine during production, are usually performed by the crew
chief (see FOH 33h11(b)(9)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)  Bread slicing—Sixteen- and 17-year-old bakery or deli
clerks may operate bread slicing and roll slicing machines of the type usually
found in retail bakeries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9)  Cleaning individual parts of power-driven bakery
machines  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
HO 11 prohibits minors under 18
years of age from cleaning power-driven bakery machines, but this prohibition
does not apply to the cleaning of the individual parts of such machines.  Only
employees over 18 years of age may dismantle or reassemble such machines.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
29 CFR  570.33(e) prohibits the
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations which involve operating,
tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing power-driven
food mixers.  Such minors may, however, clean the disassembled parts of such
machines.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  There are no provisions in HO 11 for apprentices or
student-learners.  There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Application of HO 11 to lightweight, small capacity,
counter-top food mixers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Section 570.62(b)(1), effective
July 19, 2010, provides an exception that allows 17- and 18-year-olds to
operate, set up, adjust, repair, oil and clean lightweight, small capacity,
portable counter-top power-driven food mixers that are, or comparable to,
models intended for household use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
For purposes of this exemption, a
lightweight, small capacity mixer is one that is not hardwired into the
establishment’s power source, is equipped with a motor that operates at no more
than ½ horsepower, and is equipped with a bowl with a capacity of no more than
five quarts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
This exemption shall not apply
when the mixer is used, with or without attachments, to process meat or poultry
products as prohibited by 29 CFR 570.61(a)(4).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
This exemption does not extend to
the employment of 14- and 15-year-old workers.  Minors under 16 years of age
are prohibited from operating or tending power-driven machinery, including
mixers, by CL Reg 3 (see 29 CFR 570.33(e)).  That regulation
prohibits such minors from operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning,
oiling, or repairing food mixers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
WH has determined that the
following mixers are the type that would normally fall within this limited
exemption contained at 29 CFR 570.62(b)(1).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>f.     
The K-Tec Batter Mixer Model LJS
developed for the Long John Silvers quick service restaurant chain.  The Model
LJS weighs about 8 pounds, is 11 inches in height, has a 3-quart capacity, and
operates at 1/16 horsepower. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>g.    
The Kitchen Aide counter top mixer
Model K5SSWH, which is available for home use, weighs 29 pounds, is 16.4 inches
in height, has a 5 quart capacity, and operates at 6/15 horsepower.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Application of HO 11 to certain power-driven
pizza-dough rollers</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Pizza-dough rollers, a type of
dough sheeter, are normally prohibited under HO 11.  But § 570.62(b)(2)
contains an exception that permits the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to
operate certain pizza-dough rollers that meet the following conditions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
They are constructed with
safeguards contained in the basic design so as to prevent fingers, hands, or
clothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
They have gears that are
completely enclosed, and </p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
They have microswitches that
disengage the machinery if the backs or sides of the rollers are removed.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
This exception applies only when
all the safeguards in 1. through 3. above are present on the machine, are
operational, and have not been overridden.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The policy described in (a) above
does not extend to minors who set up, adjust, repair, oil or clean the assembled
machine.  </p>
<p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Operation and cleaning of power-driven bagel slicers</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Bagel slicers which operate as
electric knives  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sixteen- and 17-year-old employees may operate and clean power-driven
bagel slicers, such as the Edgecraft Chef’s Choice Bagel Pro Bagel Slicer,
which have two blades mounted next to each other running in opposing
directions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Bagel slicers with circular cutting
blades </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
Some power-driven bagel slicers,
like the Oliver Products Bagel and Bun Slicer (Model 702) meet the definition
of a circular saw under HO 14.  These machines saw bagels in half by means of a
thin steel disc, having a continuous series of notches or teeth on the
periphery, mounted on shafting.  Although HO 11 does not address such bagel
slicers, HO 14 would normally prohibit employees under 18 years of age from
operating, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning such machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
At the request of WH, the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has examined the operation
of these machines and has advised WH that employees 16 and 17 years of age who
operate and clean such slicers (with circular blades and enclosed feed chutes)
are exposed to low safety risks.  NIOSH cited the machine’s adjustable guard
and the manufacturer’s warning sign as important contributors to this low
degree of risk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
WH will not assert a violation of
HO 14 when 16- and 17-year-old employees operate a power-driven bagel slicer
with a circular blade and enclosed feed chute when the machine is equipped with
an adjustable guard that covers the feed chute and the manufacturer’s warning
sign is affixed to the machine.  WH will not assert a violation of HO 14 when
16- and 17-year-old employees clean such machines.  Such minors, however,
continue to be prohibited from setting up, adjusting, repairing, or oiling such
machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
All power-driven bagel slicers are
“food slicers” under CL Reg 3 and therefore minors under 16 years of age may
not operate, tend, set up, adjust, clean, oil or repair such equipment (see
29 CFR 570.33(e)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Operation of pie-dough rollers by 16- and 17-year old</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The original investigative report
establishing HO 11 determined that the operation of pie-dough rollers by 16-
and 17-year-olds is safe, however, this determination applies only to those
pie-dough rollers which involve a completely automated process as used in large
wholesale bakeries. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
This process includes the use of a
pie-dough scaling machine which automatically cuts a predetermined portion of
pie dough and drops it into the “hopper feed” of the pie-dough roller.  The
pie-dough roller then flattens the dough and automatically rotates the dough
through an arc of 90°.  The pie dough is again flattened to form the desired
final shape.  The entire process eliminates any hand contact by the operator
with the rollers during operation.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
If a pie-dough roller operates as
described above – in an entirely automatic process with a machine that cuts the
dough into predetermined portions and drops it into a hopper feed or chute
attachment that prevents an operator from making contact with any in-running
points of the rollers – 16- and 17-year olds may operate this equipment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
If the pie-dough roller does not
operate as described above, it is prohibited by HO 11.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Certain pie-dough rolling machines
are very similar to pizza-dough roller machines in appearance and function (see
FOH 33h11(d)(3) for a discussion about pizza-dough rollers).  HO 11 prohibits
the operation of all pie-dough rollers except those described in (a) above. 
However, WH will not charge a violation of HO 11 regarding the employment of
16- and 17-year-olds who operate pie-dough rollers that are constructed with
safeguards contained in the basic design that prevent fingers, hands, and
clothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers; have gears
that are completely enclosed; and have microswitches that disengage the machinery
if the backs or sides of the rollers are removed.  The policy applies to such
machinery provided that all safeguards are present on the machine, are
operational, and have not been overridden.  This “no violation” policy does not
extend to minors who set up, adjust, repair, oil, or clean this equipment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Application of HO 11 to dough mixers used to mix
ingredients other than dough or batter and to attachments designed for uses
other than dough or batters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Under HO 11 the function of the
agitators determines coverage of the HO.  Therefore, a dough mixer used to mix
vegetables is covered by HO 11 if the same agitators are used as for mixing
dough.  Agitators such as the flat beater, heavy duty wire whip, dough arm, and
sweet dough arm are covered by HO 11 because they are designed for use with
dough and batter.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, if the machine is equipped with separate agitators designed
for use with vegetables or with icing, the functional use of the machine would
be different and it would not be covered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
D-Wire Whip—Occasionally,
manufacturers will report that some attachments are designed solely for use on
products lighter than dough or batters such as whipping cream, egg whites,
light icings, and meringues.  This was the case with the D-Wire Whip manufactured
by Hobart.  Field experience has documented that employers are using the
D-Wire-Whip to mix batters and other items like cream cheese despite the
intentions or statements of the manufacturer.  It is a violation of HO 11 for
16- and 17-year-olds to mix batter, cream cheese, or dough using a power-driven
batter mixer or dough mixer, regardless of the design specifications or
intentions of the manufacturer. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
I-Wire Whip—The I-Wire Whip
attachment, which is used for heavier products such as cake batter and heavy
whipping cream, is also prohibited by HO 11 for use by 16- and 17-year-olds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Cheese Grater or Cheese/Vegetable
Slicer Attachments</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
HO 11 prohibits 16- and
17-year-olds from placing attachments on vertical dough mixers (such as the
cheese grater or vegetable slicer) or removing such attachments, because those
activities constitute the setting up and adjusting of a power-driven bakery
machine.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
HO 11 does not, however, prohibit
16- and 17-year-olds from operating attachments to vertical dough mixers that
grate cheese or slice cheese/vegetables as long as someone at least 18 years of
age sets up or adjusts the attachment.  This is because these attachments
negate the operation of the machine as a vertical dough mixer.  The machine
cannot be used as a power-driven bakery machine (a dough mixer) when such
attachments are being used.  However, such minors would be prohibited from
operating any attachment to the mixer that processes meat, such as a meat
chopper or sausage maker, because of HO 10.</p>

<h3>33h12.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 12—Power-Driven Balers, Compactors,
and Paper Products Machines.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name:  Occupations involved in the operation of balers, compactors, and
paper-products machines </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally Adopted:  September 11, 1954</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 12</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  HO 12 was issued in response to the finding that the
paper-products industry experienced a somewhat higher general frequency of
injury rate than all manufacturing industries as a whole, and a somewhat higher
frequency of the more serious types of injuries and of deaths.  The
prohibitions regarding scrap paper balers were established to combat the
dangers of being caught in the plungers during the compression process and
suffering strains and other injuries while moving the compressed bales.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 12 prohibits those under 18 years of age from
operating and assisting to operate certain power-driven machines used in the
manufacture or conversion of paper or pulp into a finished product or in the
preparation of such products for recycling or disposal.  The HO applies
wherever the machines are located when operated by a covered employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  HO 12 was revised effective February 14, 2005 (see
69 FR 75393, December 16, 2004, for more information).  The major revisions
included:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Incorporating the provisions of
the Compactors and Balers Safety Standards Modernization Act (August 6, 1996)
which created FLSA § 13(c)(5).  This section, among other things, prohibits
minors under 18 years of age from operating and unloading balers and compactor,
and permits 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not operate or unload, certain
balers and compactors under specific conditions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Expanding the prohibitions of the
HO to include balers and compactors that process other materials in addition to
paper.  Prior to February 14, 2005, only balers and compactors that processed
paper products exclusively fell under the prohibitions of HO 12 (see
FOH 3312(b)(1)a for information regarding the impact of this revision).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  HO 12 was again revised by a Final Rule, effective
July 19, 2010.  That revision brought all power-driven compactors and balers,
regardless of the materials being processed, under the prohibitions of HO 12. 
The revision also clarified that the limited exemption contained in FLSA §
13(c)(5) that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not operate or unload,
certain equipment applies only to scrap paper balers and paper box compactors. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Definitions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The term operating or assisting to
operate means all work that involves starting or stopping a machine covered by
this section, placing materials into or removing materials from a machine,
including clearing a machine of jammed materials, paper, or cardboard, or any
other work directly involved in operating the machine.  The term does not
include the stacking of materials by an employee in an area nearby or adjacent
to the machine where such employee does not place the materials into the
machine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The term paper products machine
shall mean all power-driven machines used in:</p>
<p> </p>

the remanufacture or conversion of
paper or pulp into a finished product, including preparation of materials for
recycling, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
The preparation of such materials
for disposal—whether the machines are used in establishments that manufacture
converted paper or pulp products or in any other type of establishment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Compactors</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
The term paper box compactor means
a powered machine that remains stationary during operation, used to compact
refuse, including paper boxes, into a detachable or integral container or into
a transfer vehicle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
The term compactor that is
designed or used to process materials other than paper means a powered machine
that remains stationary during operation, designed or used to compact refuse
other than paper or cardboard boxes into a detachable or integral container or
into a transfer vehicle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Balers</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
The term scrap paper baler means a
powered machine used to compress paper and possibly other solid waste, with or
without binding, to a density or form that will support handling and
transportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable
container. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
The term baler that is designed or
used to process materials other than paper means a powered machine designed or
used to compress materials other than paper and cardboard boxes, with or
without binding, to a density or form that will support handling and
transportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable
container.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
The term Applicable American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard means one of the standards listed
in the chart contained in FOH 33h11(d)(2)a1  The ANSI standard for scrap
paper balers and paper box compactors govern the manufacturing and modification
of the equipment, the operation and maintenance of the equipment, and employee
training.  The Secretary of Labor may add more recent standards to the chart
upon finding that the newer standards are as protective of the safety of minors
as those already on the list.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  HO 12 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from operating,
assisting to operate, setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning the
following power-driven paper products machines, including those which do not
involve hand feeding, as well as balers and compactors:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
All balers and compactors,
regardless of the materials being processed.  This prohibition includes equipment
designed to process only paper, equipment designed to process materials other
than paper, and equipment that can process both paper and other materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
HO 12 was revised effective
February 14, 2005, to expand the prohibitions of the HO to include balers and
compactors that process other materials in addition to paper.  Prior to
February 14, 2005, only those balers and compactors that processed paper
products exclusively (no other materials placed in the machine) fell under the
prohibitions of HO 12.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
HO 12 was again revised, effective
July 19, 2010 to prohibit youth under 18 years of age from operating, assisting
to operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning all
compactors and balers, regardless of the materials being processed.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
Other materials which are
processed by scrap paper balers and paper box compactors include, but are not
limited to, plastics, rubber, food waste, foam rubber and aluminum cans.  The
risks which these machines present to minor employees remain the same,
regardless of the materials being processed.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Arm type wire stitcher or
stapler—a power-driven machine, operated by a foot treadle, which stitches
cartons together.  The carton is held by the operator during the operation. 
May be single action or it may operate continuously.</p>
<p> </p>

Circular or band saw—similar to
and operating the same as wood-working saws, used for sawing fiber or
corrugated paper stock.  It is hand fed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
Corner cutter or mitering
machine—a type of punch press used for cutting away corners for set-up box
blanks.  May be horizontal or vertical, cutting one corner (single) or two
corners (double) at a time.  It is hand fed, treadle operated, operating
continuously when pedal is depressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
Corrugating and single- or
double-facing machine—a large machine which combines plain paperboard (liners)
with corrugated paper (filler) to form corrugated paperboard.  Single facing
means a liner on one side; double facing means liners on both sides.  Machine
consists of a series of rolls which corrugates the center and glues the facing
to it.  Operating continuously from rolls of paper stock cutting to size as the
last operation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>f.     
Envelope die-cutting press—a
machine for cutting envelope blank.  A die is placed by hand on a stack of
paper and a plunger forces the die through the paper.  May be single acting or
continuous in operation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>g.    
Guillotine paper cutter or shear—a
machine consisting of a heavy knife blade held vertically by the headwork of
the machine used for cutting flat paper stock.  Paper is placed on the bed of
the machine by hand and the machine operated by a foot treadle, hand lever, or
two-handed tripping device.  Machine is single action, making one stroke at a
time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>h.    
Horizontal bar scorer—a little
used machine for scoring (cutting part-way through) heavy fiber stock.  A die
is supported by a head frame and when operated, descends into the fiber.  The
machine is foot operated and hand fed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>i.     
Laminating or combining machine—a
machine for gluing together two or more piles of paper to make a fiberboard. 
Operates in same manner as corrugating and single- or double-facing machine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>j.     
Sheeting machine—a machine for
cutting sheets of paper from a roll of paper.  Knives, mounted on revolving
arms, cut the paper as it goes through the machine.  It operates continuously,
the operator threading the paper through the machine and taking away the cut
sheets. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>k.    
Vertical slotter—a machine for
cutting slots in fiber or box board stock by means of a die which descends when
the machine is operated.  It is hand fed, foot or hand operated.  The eccentric
type employs a toothed die, actuated by a horizontal eccentric-revolving
shaft.  It operates continuously and is hand fed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 12 prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from operating
platen die-cutting presses, platen printing presses, and punch presses which
involve hand feeding of the machines.  It also prohibits these minors from
setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning these types of machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
platen die-cutting press—a machine
for cutting paper stock by means of a die mounted on the frame of the press
(the chase).  Paper is placed on the platen which swings up against the die. 
It operates continuously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
platen printing press—a machine
similar to a platen die-cutting press, except that type for printing is mounted
in the chase, instead of a die.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
punch press—a machine for cutting
out paper stock by means of a die, mounted on a plunger, which descends when
the press is operated.  May be operated by foot treadle, lever, or two-handed
tripping device.  May be single acting or continuous.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b></p>
<p> </p>

<b>Exemptions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  HO 12 contains an exemption for student-learners and

<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Loading of certain scrap paper balers and paper box
compactors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Public Law 104-174, signed August
6, 1996, amends § 13(c) of the FLSA to permit minors 16 and 17 years of age to
load (but not operate or unload) certain scrap paper balers and paper box
compactors if all of the requirements listed below are met.  This exemption
covers only the loading of such equipment, and only scrap paper balers and
paper box compactors.  No youth under 18 years of age may load any other type
of compactor or baler.  HO 12 (§ 570.63) reflects this statutory language.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
The employer must ensure that the
equipment meets, and continues to meet, one of the American National Standards
Institute’s (ANSI) Standards listed in the chart below.  One column of

The ANSI standards are industry
standards which govern the design, manufacture, operation and maintenance of
the equipment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
The FLSA does permit the Secretary
to adopt any newer ANSI standards under HO 12 once it is determined that they
are at least as protective of the safety of minors as the standards listed
above.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.    
The employer must provide notice
and post a notice on each piece of equipment stating that the equipment meets
the appropriate ANSI standard named above; that 16- and 17-year-olds may only
load the equipment; and that any employee under 18 may not operate or unload
such equipment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A.   
WH has determined that “posting” a
prominent and easily visible notice will also satisfy the requirement that
notice be “provided” (see 29 CFR 570.63(c)(1)(iv)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>B.   
There is no one format that the
notice must follow to satisfy the posting requirement, but WH believes that the
intent of FLSA § 13(c)(5) will be satisfied if each notice: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>i.     
Contains an accurate statement
that the baler or compactor to be loaded by the minor meets the applicable ANSI
standard named in § 13(c)(5)(B)(i)(I) of the FLSA or meets a more recent ANSI
standard which the Secretary has certified to be at least as protective of the
safety of minors as the standard described in FLSA § 13(c)(5)(B)(i)(I);
and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ii.    
Cites the specific ANSI standard,
including the year of issuance, that the employer is providing notice that the
equipment meets; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>iii.  
Includes a clear statement that 16-
and 17-year-olds may only load the scrap paper balers and paper box compactors;
and, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>iv.  
Includes a clear statement that no
employee under the age of 18 may operate or unload the scrap paper balers and
paper box compactors.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>C.   
WH has been advised that industry
associations such as the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) and the National
Grocers Association (NGA) have developed and marketed to their members
“notices” or “stickers” believing that such notices or stickers comport with
the requirements of FLSA § 13(c)(5).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>i.     
WH has examined the sample notices
or stickers created by both the NGA and the FMI and, as discussed in the
preamble to the final rule that became effective on February 14, 2005, noted
that these stickers do not satisfy the posting requirements of FLSA § 13(c)(5)
(see 69 FR 75394, December 16, 2004).  The stickers do not clearly
identify the applicable ANSI standard as required.  ANSI includes, in the
caption or title of each of its standards, both a “series identifier” and a
year of issuance, so as to eliminate confusion between different editions of
standards that apply to the same type of machinery.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>ii.    
WH will consider the NGA and FMI
stickers to constitute acceptable notices if they are modified to state
explicitly the full caption of the ANSI standard (both the series identifier
and the year of issuance).  This modification may, of course, be made by
printing all future stickers with the full, accurate information as to the
specific applicable standard.  But existing stickers may also be modified by
making hand-written insertions of the additional information that is necessary
to identify the specific standard.  Such insertions must be written legibly, in
indelible ink, and in the same size of lettering as the ANSI standard
identifiers already printed on the sticker.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>iii.  
The NGA and the FMI have also
developed stickers to be placed on equipment that does not meet the
requirements of the limited exemption contained in FLSA § 13(c)(5) and,
therefore, cannot be loaded, operated or unloaded by any employee who is less
than 18 years of age.  These stickers, which are not required by the Act and
the use of which is completely voluntary, alert employees that they may not
load, operate or unload the equipment unless they are 18 years of age or
older.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>D.   
Community-owned or -operated
balers and compactors  In certain situations, such as at a shopping mall,
industrial park, office building, or military base, multiple employers may have
access to and use community balers and compactors that the facilities manager
or owner has made available to the tenants or contractors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>i.     
In these situations, it is not
necessary for every employer (tenant) to post a notice as required by FLSA §
13(c)(5).  The facilities manager or owner, or the owner of the equipment, may
make the necessary postings and satisfy each employer's (tenant's) posting
obligations under the exception.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ii.    
But, should the notice not be
accurate or complete—i.e., the baler or compactor fails to meet the appropriate
ANSI standard, or the notice fails to fully identify the appropriate ANSI
standard—the burden of compliance remains with the employer (tenant) of any
youth who loaded the equipment.  An incomplete or inaccurate posting by the
facilities manager or owner will not relieve a tenant from being charged with a
violation of HO 12.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>75 FR 28440-41 (May 20, 2010)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>iii.  
Employers cannot delegate their
responsibilities for compliance by relying on the accuracy of notices posted by
others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5.    
The equipment must include an
on-off switch incorporating a key-lock or other system, and the control of the
system is maintained in the custody of employees who are at least 18 years of
age.  The “other system” may be a numerical touch pad but the passcode may not
be shared with employees under the age of 18 years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6.    
The on-off switch of the equipment
must be maintained in an off position when the equipment is not in operation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>7.    
The equipment cannot be operated
while it is being loaded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The language and legislative
history of the amendment make it clear that it is the responsibility of the
employer to make the initial determination that the equipment to be loaded by
16- and 17-year-olds meets the appropriate ANSI standards.  It is also the
employer’s responsibility to provide the notice and post it on each piece of
equipment which is loaded by 16- and 17-year-olds.  For enforcement purposes,
the posting of the notice will also satisfy the requirement that notice be
provided.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Loading of scrap paper balers and
paper box compactors not only encompasses the placing of materials into the
machines, but also includes placing materials into chutes that, by gravity,
feed the materials to the machines.  Loading also includes placing materials
onto conveyors that, by power or gravity, then feed the materials into the
balers or compactors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Laminators and packaging machines</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The type of laminators prohibited
by HO 12 are those used to laminate or combine two or more sheets of paper or
cardboard to form a multiple-ply product by applying an adhesive and running
the paper through various pressure rolls.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Laminators, such as the GBC Pouch
Laminator, which are designed to encase a document such as an identification
card between two pieces of plastic by using heat in a simple process, are not
subject to HO 12. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Machines designed to enclose and
seal products (i.e., pills and capsules) in packaging consisting primarily of
plastic or foil and some cardboard or paperboard, are not within the scope of
HO 12.  Names for this type of machine include dry mounting/laminating press;
jumbo sealer; and the euclid cadet or cadet twin unit dose strip packaging
machine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Silk Screen printing press</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This equipment, when
designed to function in the same manner as the platen printing press, is
prohibited for use by persons under the age of 18.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Three spindle paper drill (Challenge Model EH-3A for
example)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This equipment, used
for die-cutting or embossing operations, operates in the same manner as a hand
fed punch press.  Minors under 18 years of age are prohibited from operating
this equipment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Kansmacker</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The kansmacker is a
power-driven machine that sorts, counts and flattens beverage cans.  It is not
covered by HO 12.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Decollators and bursters</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A decollator is a
machine which separates stacks of multi-part paper into individual stacks (for
each copy) while removing the carbon paper.  It is often capable of trimming
the pin-feed holes from one or both sides.  A burster is a machine that takes
continuous single copy and bursts it into individual sheets or pages.  These
machines do not come within the definition of paper products machines and are
not covered under HO 12.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Cylinder press</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO 12 does not
prohibit the operation of a cylinder press.  Such machines are considered much
less hazardous than platen presses, where feeding takes place at the point of
operation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  Paper shredders </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The operation of paper
shredders is not prohibited by HO 12.  In addition, paper shredders of the type
normally used in offices may be operated by minors 14 and 15 years of age.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)  Stitcher-trimmer machine</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
A stitcher-trimmer machine
automatically collates, stitches (inserts wire staples), and trims such things
as pamphlets, periodicals, and other paper products.  WHD has examined
stitcher-trimmer machines and has determined that HO 12 does not prohibit minors
from operating those stitcher-trimmer machines that do not use a guillotine
paper cutter or shear to trim the product.  This machine is not to be confused
with an arm-type wire stitcher or stapler – a power-driven machine
prohibited by HO 12, operated by a foot treadle, and used to stitch or staple
cartons together (see FOH 33h12(b)(1)b).    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
HO 12 does prohibit youth under 18
years of age from operating those stitcher-trimmers that use a guillotine paper
cutter or shear to trim the product.  Such prohibited equipment includes the STAHL
ST-90 and the Stitchmaster ST-100, both manufactured by
Heidelberg.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9)  LiftPak compactor</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The LiftPak Compactor Model 1000,
manufactured by LiftPak, L.C., is an indoor compactor that processes material,
including paper products, by use of a ram.  This equipment is often used by
quick service restaurants.  When it is time to unload the machine, a built-in
cart containing the compacted waste is detached from the machine and manually
wheeled to the dumpster.  The operator then pushes a button on the cart and an
electric lift raises the compacted refuse to the height of the dumpster.  After
the lift tray is released, the refuse is allowed to fall into the dumpster by
gravity.  The operator then lowers the lift and wheels the cart back to the
main machine for reattaching. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Because the LiftPak Compactor
Model 1000 is a compactor that processes materials such as food waste and
plastic in addition to paper products, youth under 18 years of age are
prohibited from operating and unloading such equipment (as of February 14,
2005)—and may only load such equipment if they meet the requirements of the
exemption contained in HO 12 (see 29 CFR 570.63(c) and
FOH 33h12(d)(2)).  The prohibition on unloading includes all the
activities associated with depositing the compacted refuse into the dumpster,
including returning and reattaching the built-in cart to the equipment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
WH learned that LiftPak, L.C. has
marketed the Model 1000 as a compactor that “employees don’t have to be 18 to
operate…” and has stated on its Webpage that the Department of Labor has
approved the equipment for use by employees 16 and older.  Although such
advertisements may have been proper prior to the publication of the Final Rule
that modified HO 12 effective February 14, 2005, this information is no longer
correct.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
The electric lift that raises the
detached compaction compartment to the height of the dumpster during the
unloading process cannot be considered a hoisting apparatus prohibited under HO
7.  But as mentioned in (b) above, the detaching, emptying, and reattaching of
the container containing the waste is prohibited as “unloading” under HO 12.</p>

<h3>33h13.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 13—Brick Tile and Kindred Products.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name:  Occupations Involved in the Manufacture of Brick, Tile, and
Kindred Products</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally Adopted:  September 1, 1956</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 13</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The rate of injuries in the clay/silica construction
products industry (as determined by the report establishing HO 13) exceeded the
injury rate (including serious injuries) found in the majority of manufacturing
establishments.  The report attributed the higher frequency of worker injuries
in this industry to:  lifting, carrying, and pushing heavy objects; bricks
falling on workers from stacks or out of the workers’ hands onto themselves,
vehicle—pedestrian accidents, machine injuries, and falls caused by slippery
floors.  The report recommended that a Hazardous Occupations Order be created
to ban the employment of minors in most occupations in the clay/silica
construction products industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 13 is industry specific.  It applies to all work in
or about plants manufacturing clay construction products – except work in the
drying departments of plants manufacturing sewer pipe, in storage and shipping,
in offices, in laboratories, and in storerooms.  It also applies to work in or
about plants manufacturing silica brick, or other silica refractories, except
work in offices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Definitions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The term clay construction
products includes the following:  brick, hollow structural tile, sewer pipe and
kindred products, refractories, and other clay products, such as: 
architectural terra cotta, glazed structural tile, roofing tile, stove lining,
chimney pipes and tops, wall coping, and drain tile.  The term does not include
non-structural clay products, such as ceramic floor and wall tile, mosaic tile,
glazed and enameled tile, faience and similar tile.  Nor does the term include
non-clay construction products such as sand-lime brick, glass brick, or
non-clay refractories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The term silica brick or other
silica refractories means refractory products produced from raw materials
containing free silica as their main constituent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The terms drawing and wheeling
shall mean the process of removing brick, after it has cooled, from the kiln to
storage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  All occupations (except those permitted in
FOH 33h13(c)(1)) in or about establishments engaged in manufacturing clay
construction products.  Examples of prohibited occupations/machines include: 
crushers, granulators, dry pans, and screens; storage bin work; operators of
pug mills, auger or extrusion machines; cutting machines; hackers; car pushers;
sewer pipe press crew; brick forming machine crew; glaziers; setters, tossers;
burners; and drawers.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  All work/occupations (except in offices) in
establishments engaged in manufacturing silica brick or other silica
refractories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The following are permissible occupations for
establishments in the clay construction products industry:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Work in storage and shipping.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Work in offices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Work in the drying departments of
plants manufacturing sewer pipe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Work in offices in establishments manufacturing silica
brick or other silica refractories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are no provisions in HO 13 for apprentices or student-learners. 
There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Glazing of cylinders</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Work in and about a
plant where silica, lime, and asbestos are mixed together to form a glaze
(subsequently used to coat the inside of cylinders) is work prohibited by HO
13.  The glaze contains free silica as a main constituent; consequently, the
area where it is produced meets the definition of an establishment where silica
refractories are manufactured (see 29 CFR 570.64(a)(2) and
570.64(b)(2)).  In light of the preceding, work in or about such an
establishment is prohibited.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Asbestos</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Asbestos is a form of
magnesium silicate; however, it does not contain any free silica.  Since it does
not contain free silica, establishments manufacturing asbestos are not making a
silica refractory and are not covered by HO 13.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Shipping and storage of brick</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Preparing bricks for storage,
inside the manufacturing building and adjacent to the kilns (even after the
bricks have been removed from the kiln and placed on flat cars), is work
covered by HO 13.  For example: stacking the bricks on skids, and strapping
them down in order to move them to a storage area outside the building, is work
considered to be within the drawing and wheeling department and not within the
purview of storage and shipping.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Removing bricks from inside the
kiln in the process of loading them or moving them to storage, is not work in
storage and shipping, and therefore is covered by HO 13.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Clay drain tile</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The setting and
drawing of tile in clay drain tile plant is prohibited by HO 13.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33h14.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 14—Power Driven Circular Saws, Band
Saws, Guillotine Shears, Chain Saws, Reciprocating Saws, Wood Chippers, and
Abrasive Cutting Discs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name:  Occupations involved in the operation of circular saws, band
saws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, and
abrasive cutting discs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally Adopted:  November 15, 1960</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 14</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  HO 14 is broad and embraces the use of circular saws,
band saws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers,
and abrasive cutting discs wherever they are used—other than in the industries
where they are already prohibited by earlier HOs.  This HO differs from most
other HOs in that it recognizes that the above named machines are banned
irrespective of the specific industry in which they are used or the specific
materials (paper, meat, metal, etc.) upon which they are being used.  The use
of most saws and shears is prohibited by HOs 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, and 12.  HO 14
was issued to “close the gap” and protect youths working in other industries
where such machines are used.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Examples include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
HO 4 prohibits the use of chain
saws by minors in logging operations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
HO 5 prohibits the use of saws in
woodworking operations such as furniture factories and construction sites.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
HO 8 prohibits the use of
guillotine shears on metal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.    
HO 10 prohibits the use of saws to
cut meat and bones.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5.    
HO 11 prohibits the use of saws to
cut bakery products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6.    
HO 12 prohibits the use of saws
and shears to cut paper products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 14 became effective before the 1961 and 1966
amendments to the FLSA that made previously noncovered retail stores subject to
the child labor provisions.  It was revised by the 2010 Final Rule (see 75 FR
28404), which added more types of prohibited machines.  Since the scope of HO
14 is broad, it can be applied to circular saws, band saws, guillotine shears,
chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, and abrasive cutting discs found
in all establishments covered by the FLSA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Generally, WH will only charge a single violation when
the same piece of equipment is prohibited by HO 14 and another HO (such as HO
5, HO 11, HO 12, etc.) WH normally will apply the provisions of HO 14 whenever
a piece of equipment named in HO 14 is the subject of the violation. For
example, wood chippers meet the definition of power-driven woodworking machines
contained in § 570.55(b) and therefore are prohibited by HO 5.  But because
such equipment is specifically named in HO 14, and is used in a variety of
establishments (saw milling, pallet shops, mulch manufacturing, landscape
services, waste disposal and recycling, etc.), WH will generally charge
violations regarding the operating and assisting in the operation of wood
chippers under HO 14.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The scope of this order includes operating, assisting
to operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or and cleaning the named
equipment wherever found in a covered establishment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  HO 14 covers only power-driven equipment; any
occupation that involves only manually operated saws, cutting discs, or shears
(not power-driven) is outside the scope of the HO.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  Definitions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a. The term abrasive cutting disc shall mean a machine
equipped with a disc embedded with abrasive materials used for cutting
materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The term band saw shall mean a
machine equipped with an endless steel band having a continuous series of
notches or teeth, running over wheels or pulleys, and used for sawing materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The term chain saw shall mean a
machine that has teeth linked together to form an endless chain used for
cutting materials</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.    
The term circular saw shall mean a
machine equipped with a thin steel disc having a continuous series of notches
or teeth on the periphery, mounted on shafting, and used for sawing materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.    
The term guillotine shear shall
mean a machine equipped with a movable blade operated vertically and used to
shear materials.  The term shall not include other types of shearing machines,
using a different form of shearing action, such as alligator shears or circular
shears.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>f.     
The term reciprocating saw shall
mean a machine equipped with a moving blade that alternately changes direction
on a linear cutting axis used for sawing materials.  Jig saws are reciprocating
saws.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>g.    
The term wood chipper shall mean a
machine equipped with a feed mechanism, knives mounted on a rotating chipper
disc or drum, and a power plant used to reduce to chips or shred such materials
as tree branches, trunk segments, landscape waste, and other materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>h.    
The term operator shall mean a
person who operates a machine covered by this section by performing such
functions as starting or stopping the machine, placing materials into or
removing them from the machine, or any other functions directly involved in
operation of the machine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>i.     
The term helper shall mean a
person who assists in the operation of a machine covered by this section by
helping place materials into or remove them from the machine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>j.     
The term machine equipped with
full automatic feed and ejection shall mean machines covered by this HO which
are equipped with devices for full automatic feeding and ejection and with a
fixed barrier guard to prevent completely the operator or helper from placing
any part of his or her body in the point-of-operation area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  HO 14 prohibits minors from performing the occupations
of operator of, or helper on, power-driven circular saws, band saws and
guillotine shears which are not equipped with full automatic feed and ejection.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 14 prohibits minors from performing the occupations
of operator or helper on power-driven chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood
chippers, and abrasive cutting discs; it does not matter if the machines are
fixed or portable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  HO 14 prohibits minors from performing the occupations
of setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning power-driven circular
saws, band saws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood
chippers, or abrasive cutting discs regardless of the manner items are fed into
or ejected from the machines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Minors may operate or help in the operation of circular saws, band saws
and guillotine shears when the equipment is fitted with devices for full
automatic feeding and ejection and with a fixed guard which prevents operators
or helpers from placing any part of their bodies in the point-of-operation
area.  There is no such provision for operating or assisting in the operation
of chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, or abrasive cutting discs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO 14 does provide an exemption for student-learners and apprentices. 
No other exemptions apply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33h15.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 15—Wrecking, Demolition, and Shipbreaking
Operations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name:  Occupations involved in wrecking, demolition, and shipbreaking
operations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally Adopted:  November 15, 1960</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 15</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The study promulgating HO 15 noted that wrecking and
demolition work is fraught with many hazards including those involved with
maintaining and operating power equipment; falls from many levels while working
on scaffolds, on insecure walls and around unguarded material chutes; being
struck by falling objects or swinging loads; collapse of walls; and other
hazards such as the dangers of high voltage, fire, explosions, and muscle
strains from handling heavy materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 15 is industry-wide and deals with occupations
performed on site of total or partial razing, demolishing, or dismantling of
buildings, bridges, steeples, towers, chimneys, other structures, ships or
other vessels, including clean-up and salvage work.</p>

<p>(2)  Asbestos removal</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The removal of
asbestos or other hazardous materials from a building or other structure prior
to demolition is not uncommon – it makes the work safer.  Such work is subject
to HO 15.  But if the hazardous materials are being removed from the building
or components of the building, such as pipes, and the building or the
components remain in place to be re-insulated or recovered, the removal work
will not constitute “demolition work” and is not covered by HO 15.</p>

<h3>33h16.   HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 16—Roofing Operations and   Work On
or About a Roof.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name:  Occupations in Roofing Operations and On or About a Roof</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally Adopted:  December 27, 1961</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 16</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  At the time HO 16 was written, roofing had long been
recognized as one of the most hazardous occupations in the building
construction industry.  The report establishing HO 16 determined the hazards
associated with roofing – such as falling from roofs and leaning out over the
edge of a roof to receive hoisted materials – were difficult to control and the
resulting injuries were frequently very serious.  In light of this, the report
concluded that “all work performed in connection with the application of
weather-proofing materials and substances to the roofs of buildings and
structures is too hazardous for the employment of 16 and 17 year old persons.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 16 was originally specific to the roofing industry,
prohibiting all roofing industry operations, including those operations not
performed on a roof.  HO 16 was revised, effective February 14, 2005, to also
prohibit all work on or about a roof (see 69 FR 75397-98).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Definitions (see 29 CFR 570.67(b))</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The term roofing operations means
all work performed in connection with the installation of roofs, including
related metal work such as flashing, and applying weatherproofing materials and
substances (such as waterproof membranes, tar, slag or pitch, asphalt prepared paper,
tile, composite roofing materials, slate, metal, translucent materials, and
shingles of asbestos, asphalt, wood or other materials) to roofs of buildings
or other structures.  The term also includes all jobs on the ground related to
roofing operations such as roofing laborer, roofing helper, materials handler
and tending a tar heater. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The term on or about a roof
includes all work performed upon or in close proximity to a roof, including
carpentry and metal work, alterations, additions, maintenance and repair,
including painting and coating of existing roofs; the construction of the
sheathing or base of roofs (wood or metal), including roof trusses or joists;
gutter and downspout work; the installation and servicing of television and
communication equipment such as cable and satellite dishes; the installation
and servicing of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment or similar
appliances attached to roofs; and any similar work that is required to be
performed on or about roofs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
The regulatory phrase on or about
a roof is not limited to circumstances where the minor employee is standing or
working on the roof itself.  The prohibition extends to standing or working on
a ladder or scaffold at or near the roof, working on the installation of roof
trusses or joists which will support the roof, as well as working from or being
transported to or from the roof in mechanical devices such as hoists.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
Generally, 16- and 17-year-olds
may legally perform certain occupations that require them to work at heights,
such as painting, window washing, installing siding, and the power-washing of
walls.  But such occupations would be prohibited when the minor is required to
work in close proximity to a roof.  WH has adopted two enforcement positions
that provide guidance as to when the employment of a youth performing such
occupations violates HO 16 because he or she is working in close proximity
to a roof (See FOH 33h16(d)(1)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  HO 16 prohibits all occupations in roofing
operations.  This includes work done on the ground such as material handling,
tending tar kettles, and clean-up work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  As of February 14, 2005, HO 16 also prohibits the
performance of any work on or about a roof.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Minors under 18 years of age are also prohibited from
using a roof as a point of access, egress, or a platform from which to access
or perform other work such as window washing or the rigging of window washing
equipment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO 16 does contain an exemption for student-learners and apprentices. 
There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Working in close proximity to a roof</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Single-story building </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
WH will not charge a violation of
HO 16 when a minor is working in proximity to a roof of a one-story building as
long as the minor’s feet are never more than three feet off the ground level. 
The three-foot tolerance is measured from the ground or pavement at the base of
the building to the bottom of the minor’s feet.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
The minor is still prohibited from
performing any work described in FOH 33h16(a)(3) above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Multiple-story building</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.    
WH will not charge a violation of
HO 16 when a minor is working in proximity to a roof of a multi-story building
(a building of more than one story) if the minor always maintains a distance of
at least three feet (36 inches) from the roof edge.  The 36 inches is measured
from the top of the youth’s head to bottom edge of the roof that is directly
over (perpendicular to) the youth’s head.     </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.    
A distance of 3 feet ensures that
the working minor, no matter how long his or her reach, will not come into
contact with the bottom edge of the roof of a multi-story building.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.    
Using a straight, vertical line
from the top of the minor’s head to the bottom of the roof’s edge to measure
the 36 inch allowance permits minors to work at various heights on buildings
that do not have horizontal or single-level roof lines, such as split level
buildings, gabled buildings and sheds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The enforcement positions
discussed in a. and b. above apply only as long as the minor does not use the
roof to egress the work area and is not performing work that is prohibited by
HO 16 or any other HO.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Removal of an old roof</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The tearing off of the
old roof in conjunction with the installation of a new roof is considered a
“roofing operation” and is covered under HO 16, notwithstanding that different
mechanics may perform this work in various geographic areas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Metal buildings  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Prior to February 14, 2005, the
installation of metal roofs generally did not fall within the prohibitions of
HO 16 because such work was normally performed entirely by ironworkers,
steelworkers, or sheet metal mechanics – not by roofers.  Consequently, in most
instances, this work was not considered a “roofing operation” prohibited by HO
16.  On February 14, 2005, HO 16 was revised to prohibit youth under 18 years of
age from installing metal roofs, including those on metal buildings (see
29 CFR 570.67(b)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Roofing companies do occasionally
remove existing all-metal roofs and replace them, and the purlins, with a new
roof.  The work continues to be considered a “roofing operation” covered by HO
16.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Weatherproofing the top of television transmitting
towers  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The definition of a
roofing operation includes the application of weatherproofing materials to
roofs of buildings, or other structures (see 29 CFR 570.67(b)).  Consequently,
weatherproofing the top of television transmitting towers is covered by HO 16. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Measuring a roof</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The measuring of a
roof to estimate the cost of a new roof is work “performed in connection with
the installation of roofs…” and it is covered by HO 16.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>33h17 . HAZARDOUS OCCUPATIONS ORDER 17—Excavation Operations.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Name:  Occupations in Excavation Operations</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Originally Adopted:  May 9, 1963</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)  
<b>Scope of HO 17</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Individuals employed in excavation operations (which
includes trenching, building excavation, tunneling, and shaft sinking) are
exposed to injury producing hazards such as cave-ins, falls climbing in and out
of the excavated site, working in close proximity with heavy earth moving
machines, and the fall of rock from the sides and roof of the site.  Excavation
operations were selected for study, according to the report establishing HO 17,
because several states had requested an investigation by the Department and
because the Department had received many reports concerning minors being injured
while employed in excavation operations.  Fatalities and injuries resulting
from cave-ins are still a problem in the construction industry.  On April 17,
1998, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) issued a
“warning” concerning the danger of cave-ins.  This report stated that six
workers were killed by cave-ins in the first four months of 1998, and that, on
average, 60 people die each year in accidents caused by cave-ins. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 17 is process specific.  The scope of HO 17
includes all work excavating, working in, and backfilling trenches; excavating
for buildings or other structures and working in such excavations; driving
tunnels; and sinking shafts, except in certain specified situations (see FOH
33h17(c)).  It does not include site clearing or surface grading operations,
dredging and bore-hole drilling operations, and mining and quarrying operations
covered by HO 3 and HO 9. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Definitions </p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
The term excavation operation
means the removal of earth, rock, or other material to form a cavity below the
surface of the ground.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
The term trenches includes ditches
(see Acting Administrator Flynn's letter of January 24, 1990).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
The term angle of repose is that
angle where the soil comprising the cut side walls no longer moves or it is at
rest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)  
<b>Occupations PROHIBITED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  HO 17 prohibits minors from working in occupations in
excavating, working in, or backfilling (refilling) trenches [except they may
manually excavate/backfill and work in trenches which do not exceed four feet
in depth at any point (see FOH 33h17(c)(1)). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  HO 17 prohibits minors from working in occupations in
excavating for buildings or other structures, or working in such excavations
[except they may manually excavate to a depth not exceeding four feet below any
ground surface adjoining the excavation and they may work in any excavation not
exceeding four feet or where the side walls are shored or sloped to the angle
of repose (see FOH 33h17(c)(2)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  HO 17 prohibits minors from working in tunnels prior
to the completion of all driving and shoring operations. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  HO 17 prohibits minors from working within shafts
prior to the completion of all sinking and shoring operations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)  
<b>Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY
BANNED</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Trenches.  Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may manually
excavate, manually backfill, and work in trenches which do not exceed four feet
in depth at any point. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Excavating for buildings and other structure</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.    
Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may
manually excavate to a depth not exceeding four feet below any ground surface
adjoining the excavation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.    
Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may work
in an excavation not exceeding a depth of four feet. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.    
Sixteen- and 17-year-olds may
working in an excavation where the side walls are shored or sloped to the angle
of repose.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  HO 17 does not apply to site clearing or surface
grading operations, nor to dredging and bore-hole drilling operations. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)  
<b>Exemptions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>HO 17 does contain an exemption for student-learners and apprentices. 
There are no other exemptions applicable to this order.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)  
<b>Enforcement positions</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Road graders</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The use of road graders (power-driven earth moving equipment) in
excavation operations is prohibited by HO 17.  The study conducted by the
Department that established HO 17 did not include surface grading operations
(i.e. use of road graders).  However, as HO 17 only permits manual excavation
or backfilling and only at a depth of up to four feet – and road graders
constitute mechanized excavation, often in ditches up to six feet in depth – the
use of road graders is prohibited.</p>

<h3>36a00 - History.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHAct) was enacted to ensure safe
and healthful working conditions for working men and women.  The OSHAct is a
law with broad applicability, and is generally interpreted and enforced either
directly by the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA), or by an OSHA approved State Plan state agency (see FOH 36a02).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 651, et seq.; 29 U.S.C 655 &amp; 657; 29 CFR 1903.03(a)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Pursuant to
section 6 of the OSHAct, OSHA issued regulations (see 29 CFR 1928.110 and
1910.142) establishing minimum standards for field sanitation (FS) and
temporary labor camps (TLC) in covered agricultural settings.  A detailed
discussion of the FS requirements appears in section 36d of this chapter, and
the TLC requirements appear in section 36e.</p>

Dunlop. 425 F.Supp.900;</p>
<p>National Congress of Hispanic American Citizens v.

<p>Farmworker Justice Fund, Inc. v. Brock. 811 F.2d 613,
258 U.S.App.D.C. 271</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Following a
pilot project involving the exchange of certain enforcement responsibilities
between the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) and OSHA, and pursuant to Secretary’s
Order 5-96 (see 62 Fed. Reg. 107), the authority to conduct inspections, issue
citations and propose penalties and to develop and issue compliance
interpretations regarding FS and TLC requirements to enforce compliance by
agricultural employers under sections 8, 9, and 10 of the OSHAact was
transferred from OSHA to WHD.  However, OSHA retained rulemaking authority for
FS and TLC under section 6 of the OSHAct.  The effective date of this transfer
was February 3, 1997.</p>

<h3>36a01 - Purpose.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Act was enacted
“to ensure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe
and healthful working conditions…”  Absent or inadequate sanitation and hygiene
has long been recognized by medical science as a principal factor in the
transmission of bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases.  Inadequate water
supply and human waste removal have been shown to produce critical health
problems.  Provision of potable drinking water, the proper disposal of human
wastes, and the use of personal and public hygienic practices are known to
prevent heat related illnesses and the transmission of many communicable
diseases.  Thus, the provision of sanitation facilities is necessary to ensure
safe and healthy working conditions.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>36a02 - Jurisdiction.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Effective
February 3, 1997, the WHD acquired the authority to interpret and enforce the
OSHAct FS and TLC requirements in the following states or territories:</p>

<p>The WHD DOES NOT have the authority to enforce the FS
and TLC requirements under the OSHAct in the State Plan states that have
retained jurisdiction.  However, WHD will continue to enforce the TLC standards
(29 CFR 1910.142) where applicable under MSPA and H-2A (see FOH 36 and 38)</p>

<h3>36b00 - Foreword.</h3>
<p>                        </p>
<p>Generally, agricultural employees of an agricultural
employer are covered by the OSHAct, and OSHA has promulgated several standards
for the protection of the safety and health of agricultural workers (29 CFR
1928).  These standards include rules for sanitation facilities in the field
(29 CFR 1928.110).  A separate OSHA standard requires sanitation facilities in
temporary labor camps (29 CFR 1910.142).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When conducting an OSHA Field Sanitation
inspection/investigation statutory coverage must first be established followed
by regulatory coverage under 29 CFR 1910.142 and 1928.110.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>52 Fed. Reg. 16050-01, 1987 WL 142266 (F.R.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>36b01 - Agricultural Employer.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An agricultural employer is defined as “any person,
corporation, association, or other legal entity that:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(i)    Owns or
operates an agricultural establishment;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(ii)  Contracts with the
owner or operator of an agricultural establishment in advance of production for
the purchase of a crop and exercises substantial control over production; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(iii) Recruits and supervises
employees or is responsible for the management and condition of an agricultural
establishment.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An agricultural establishment is defined as “a
business operation that uses paid employees in the production of food, fiber,
or other materials such as seed, seedlings, plants or parts of plants.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Specified as employers are those who both recruit and
supervise employees, (e.g. many crew leaders and harvest companies), as well as
those who are responsible for the management and condition of an agricultural
establishment.  Additionally, an advance purchaser of a crop or a substantial
part of a crop who exercises substantial control over production is specified
to be an employer.  OSHA sought to hold jointly and severally responsible for
compliance those who are best able to assure that adequate sanitation
facilities and potable water are provided to farm workers in the fields.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>52 Fed. Reg. 16050-01, 1987 WL 142266 (F.R.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>36b02 - Statutory Coverage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Statutory coverage under the OSHAct exists where
there is a person who meets the definition of an employer who employs at least
one employee.  Under Sec. 3 of the OSHAct, person is defined as “…one or more
individuals, partnerships, associations, corporations, business trusts, legal
representatives, or any organized group of persons.”  An employer “means a
person engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees,” and an
employee “means an employee of an employer who is employed in a business of his
employer which affects commerce.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Commerce means trade, traffic, commerce,
transportation, or communication among the several States, or between a State
and any place outside thereof, or within the District of Columbia, or a
possession of the United Sates, or between points in the same State but through
a point outside thereof.  As used in the OSHAct, the terms affects commerce and
affecting commerce are, for all intents and purposes, synonymous. (Note: 
Affects commerce appears in the statutory definition of employee, and affecting
commerce is in the definition of employer.)  Although not defined in the
statute, both affects commerce and affecting commerce describe the breadth of
activities relative to commerce which govern whether the Act applies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Conceptually, the terms affects and affecting
commerce include, but are more expansive than, the FLSA term engaged in
commerce or the production of goods for commerce.  OSHA, the Occupational
Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC - see FOH 36f), and the courts have
consistently construed affects and affecting commerce so as to have the
broadest possible application.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In summary, in order to determine whether the OSHAct
applies to a given agricultural employer, the employer needs to be engaging in
commerce or affecting commerce.  This is somewhat broader than the FLSA
language “engaged in commerce.”  An employer not “engaging in commerce” could
be considered to affect commerce.  Secondly, the agricultural establishment
must be an employer, and lastly, the employer must have employees who affect
commerce.  Note that the concept of employee is controlled by what the employer
does, not by what the employee does.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nothing in the OSHAct’s coverage is conceptually
parallel to individual coverage under the FLSA.  Also, no dollar volume test
exists under OSHAct.  It applies to employers regardless of their annual dollar
volume of business.  It also apples to employers who would be otherwise exempt
from the provisions of MSPA, (i.e. the family farm exemption).  No comparable
exemptions exist under the OSHAct.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Statutory coverage cannot be presumed, it must be
affirmatively established and documented for every case.  Once statutory
coverage is established, it must be determined whether the employer is subject
to either (or both) the FS and TLC regulations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 651, et. seq.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>36b03 - Regulatory Coverage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   After
establishing statutory coverage, coverage under 29 CFR 1928.110 needs to be
established.  Agricultural employers that have employed 11 or more workers “on
any given day in hand-labor operations in the field” during the preceding 12
months must provide field sanitation facilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 1928.110(a).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The time span
used to determine the number of employees controlled by the employer shall be
the single highest number employed at any one time over the past 12 months. 
Only those employees who fall within the definition of “hand-labor operations”
are to be counted.  Particular attention should be given to the excluded field
or field-related activities when counting covered employees, as defined at 29 CFR
1928.110(a)(iii).  At least 11 or more employees have to be working in the
field on any single day within the past 12 months.  Family members of the
employer are not counted for the purpose of determining whether there are
eleven hand laborers in the field.  Finally, the 11 or more workers may have
worked in separate fields, and the number of employees is day specific (i.e., not
a collective or cumulative count).  The number of employees employed on the
date that the investigation does not determine coverage unless that number
equals 11 or more workers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>See 52 Fed. Reg. 16084; 02/06/1989 OSHA Memorandum </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Hand-labor
Operations:  Only employees engaged in hand-labor agricultural activities or
agricultural operations, and only those employees engaged in hand-labor
operations are to be counted towards the eleven or more workers.  Hand-labor
operations refer to agricultural activities or agricultural operations
performed by hand or with hand tools.  Except for purposes of 29 CFR
1928.110(c)(2)(iii), the term also includes other activities or operations
performed in conjunction with hand labor in the field.  Activities such as
hand-cultivation, hand-weeding, hand-planting and hand-harvesting of
vegetables, nuts, fruits, seedlings or other crops, and the hand-packing of
produce into containers, whether done on the ground, on a moving machine or in
a temporary packing shed located in the field, are all examples of hand-labor
operations.  Hand-labor is defined as activities “on the ground, on a moving
machine or in a temporary packing shed located in the field.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Machine Operators:  Those operating machines in
conjunction with hand-laborers, such as tractor drivers pulling the platform
from which the hand-labor occurs, are also covered. For example, if an employer
has a tractor effectively working as part of a crew in a field, the tractor
operator is to be treated as a hand laborer for the purpose of calculating the
number of hand laborers working in the field.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 1928.110(b); 52 Fed. Reg. 16086-16087.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Mushroom farms: 
hand-labor operations in growing mushrooms, whether inside permanent structures
or not, are expressly covered under the field sanitation standard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            52 Fed. Reg. 16087</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Workers in
permanent greenhouse structures, packing or canning workers in permanent
structures, workers engaged in logging or livestock operations, or those
working on agricultural machinery not in conjunction with hand-laborers are not
covered by the field sanitation standard.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>            29 CFR 1928.110(b); 52 Fed. Reg. 16087.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>36b04 - Joint Employment/Joint Responsibility.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The OSHAct defines an employer as a person engaged in
a business affecting commerce who has employees ... (29 USC 652(5)).  Congress
intended the Act to reach as far as its commerce power constitutionally permits
and thus intended employer to be defined as broadly as possible to protect
every working man and woman.  29 USC 651(b); Usery v. Lacy, 628 F.2d 1226 (9th
Cir. 1980); 29 CFR 1975.3(a).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The preamble to OSHA’s Field Sanitation standard (FS)
makes it clear that the Agency intended to include as employers all persons who
could be considered employers under ...the OSHAct.  In broadly defining
agricultural employer, the Agency sought to hold jointly and severally
responsible for compliance those who are best able to assure that adequate
sanitation facilities and potable water are provided to farmworkers in the
fields. (52 Fed. Reg. 16050, 16086; May 1, 1987).</p>

April 25, 1994</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>36b05 - Reforestation.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Reforestation – the provisions of the field
sanitation standards are applicable to reforestation activities.  It is similar
to other agricultural field operations.  Several courts have held that employees
engaged in reforestation are covered by legislation for the protection of
agricultural workers, and finally, the most common method of performing
reforestation activities is by hand-labor operations.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Davis Forestry Corp. v. Smith, 707 F. 2d 1325, 1328
n. 3 (1983);</p>
<p>OSHA Memorandum July 30, 1990</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>36b06 - Christmas Trees.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Because it meets the definitions of agricultural
employer, agricultural establishment and hand-labor, the OSHA Field Sanitation
Standards are applicable to Christmas tree farms.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>36b07 - Pine Straw.</h3>
<p>Pine straw is the fresh, undecomposed pine needles
that have fallen from pine trees.  It is produced commercially and collected
for use as a mulch and groundcover.  The raking, gathering, baling and loading
of pine straw for commercial purposes is usually performed in pine stands or
plantations, from pine trees being grown for forestry and lumbering operations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pine stand owners qualify as agricultural employers
because they own or operate pine stands or pine plantations, which qualify as
agricultural establishments.  Pine straw workers generally qualify for the
protections of the OSHAct field sanitation standards when the agricultural
establishment employs 11 or more workers on any one day during the previous 12
months to perform “hand labor” field work.  Workers performing such work in
different fields at the same establishment should be included in the employee
count for determining coverage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department has determined that the OSHAct field
sanitation standards apply to employer operations who employ employees in
hand-labor operations necessary to the gathering pine straw for sale as a
commodity.</p>

<h3>36c00 - Scope.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Fewer than 11 employees engaged in hand-labor
operations – A small employer who employs fewer than 11 employees engaged in
hand-labor operations over the past 12 months is not subject to the Field
Sanitation Standards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 1928.110(a); 52 Fed. Reg. 16087</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>36c01 - Terrain Exception.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Toilet and hand-washing facilities would not need to
be provided as required by 29 CFR 1928.110(c)(2)(i) if, due to terrain, it
would not be feasible to locate them within one quarter mile walk of where the
employees are working.  Instead,  the facilities must  be located at the point
of closest vehicular access.  OSHA intends the term accessibly located to mean
“easily reached without crossing an unbridged stream, a super highway, or any
natural or man-made barrier to reach the toilet and handwashing facility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some fields for example may be located on steep
mountain sides, river deltas or wetlands and the like, into or on which
portable facilities cannot be located.  Where the one-quarter-mile walk
requirement cannot be met due to terrain, the facilities should be placed as
near as physically possible to the workers which under such circumstances would
be at the point of closest vehicular access.  However, the size of a field, in
and of itself, is not a factor in determining whether due to terrain, it is not
possible to place the facilities within a one quarter mile walking distance.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>36c02 - Three-hour Exception.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Under 29 CFR 1928.110(c)(2)(v), the toilet and
hand-washing facilities need not be provided for employees who perform field
work for a period of three hours or less, including transportation to and from
fields.  This exception is limited to the provision of toilets and handwashing
facilities and does not extend to drinking water or the reasonable use
requirement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 1928.110; 52 Fed. Reg. 16090</p>

<h3>36d00 - Summary.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The OSHA standard at 29 CFR 1928.110 requires that
covered employees engaged in hand-labor operations be provided at no cost and
with reasonable use of with drinking water, toilet facilities and hand-washing
facilities by their agricultural employer. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 1928.110   </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>36d01 - No Charge to Employees Allowed.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The field sanitation facilities must be provided at
no cost to the employee (see 29 CFR 1928.110(c)).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employers who charge for field sanitation facilities
are subject to citation and penalties under the OSHAct.  Where the evidence
supports a finding that an employer charged the cost for providing required
facilities to the employees, the WHI should inform the employer that such
charges are unlawful and seek restitution for the affected workers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, charging for field sanitation facilities
violates the FLSA obligation to pay the minimum wage if it takes the employee’s
wages below FLSA MW in a non-overtime workweek; such deductions cannot be made
in overtime workweeks to an employee who is entitled to FLSA OT compensation
(e.g. potentially reforestation workers) (see FOH32j08).  The same principle
applies to H-2A covered workers: such deductions cannot take H-2A covered
workers below the H-2A required wage; in addition to a potential wage
violation, it may also be failure to comply with other laws.  If the cost is
passed on to the workers via deduction from pay, it may be a violation of MSPA’s
obligation to pay wages owed when due since illegal deductions cannot be taken. 
A MSPA violation for failing to disclose all terms and conditions of employment
may also exist if the workers were not properly notified of the cost to the
workers (albeit illegal) for the facilities.  Whether such a charge constitutes
an impermissible deduction under other laws and regulations enforced by the WHD
shall be determined based upon the requirements of the law and regulation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 1928.110(c) </p>
<p>   </p>

<h3>36d02 - Potable Drinking Water.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employers must
provide suitably cool, potable drinking water in sufficient amounts to meet the
needs of all employees, to be dispensed by single-use drinking cups or drinking
fountains, and to be placed in locations readily accessible to all employees. Common
or shared drinking vessels are not permitted.  29 CFR 1928.110(c)(1)(i)-(iii). 
The amount and temperature of the water is not defined by the standard but is
determined by the particular conditions of the actual work.  The water must be
available in amounts needed for satisfying thirst, cooling, waste elimination
and metabolism.  The temperature must be low enough to encourage employees to
drink and to cool the core body temperature.  At least 2-3 gallons of drinking
water are to be provided per worker on a hot day.  The water temperature is to
be between 55-60 degrees Fahrenheit to facilitate absorption into the blood and
encourage use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 1928.110; 52 Fed. Reg. 16087-16088</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   “Potable
drinking water” means water that meets the water quality standards for drinking
purposes of either the state or local authority having jurisdiction over
supplies of drinking water or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National
Primary Drinking Water Regulations, published in 40 CFR 141. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>52 Fed. Reg. 16087</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Drinking water
must be provided to all covered workers regardless of time in the field whereas
toilets and handwashing facilities must be provided to workers who are in the
field three hours or more per day, including travel time to and from the field. 
If drinking water is not available for all hours of hand-labor operations, it
is not provided and readily accessible as required. 29 CFR 1928.110(c)(2)(v).</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>36d03 - Toilets and Handwashing Facilities.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The employer
must provide toilets and handwashing facilities (filled with potable water) in
the ratio of 1 for every 20 workers or a fraction thereof to be located within
¼ mile of the work site, or if not feasible, at the point of closest vehicular
access.  Toilet and handwashing facilities shall be accessibly located and in
close proximity to each other.  No requirement exists to provide separate
toilet facilities for male and female workers under the field sanitation
standard. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 1928.110(c)(2)(i),(iii),&amp; (iv)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Toilets must be
ventilated to reduce heat and noxious odors inside the facility, be adequately
screened, and have self-closing doors that can be latched from the inside so as
to deter the entry of pests and to afford privacy to the user.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 1928.110(c)(ii)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The handwashing
facilities must include soap, potable water and single-use towels in amounts to
satisfy needs.  Pre-moistened towelettes, hand-sanitizers, nor any waterless
handcleaning system are not acceptable.</p>

<h3>36d04 - Maintenance.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Facilities must be maintained in a clean and sanitary
condition and the drinking water containers must be refilled daily or more
often as necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 1928.110(c)(3)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>36d05 - Disclosure and Reasonable Use.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employers must inform the workers of the location of
the facilities, provide reasonable opportunities during the workday to use
them, and inform them of the importance of good hygienic practices to reduce
harmful exposure to heat, communicable diseases, retention of urine, and
pesticides. These hygiene practices are listed in 29 CFR 1928.110(c)(4).</p>

<h3>36e00 - Introduction.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Migrant agricultural worker temporary housing inspections
normally will be conducted under MSPA, (see FOH Chapter 36) or the H-2A program
requirements pertaining to housing (see FOH Chapter 38). It is recommended that
the WHI first determine whether or not temporary labor camp housing standards
can be enforced under MSPA or H-2A.  Generally, enforcement of the temporary
labor camp standards (i.e., 29 CFR 1910.142) should be carried out under the
MSPA statutory authority or H-2A program of the INA if the employer is subject
to those requirements.  However, if the employer housing is located within a
State for which WHD has jurisdiction under the OSHAct and it is uncertain
whether or not MSPA coverage applies or if the provider of the housing can
claim a MSPA exemption - or if the violations involve risks to health and
safety that warrant the application of the remedies available under OSHAct, the
investigation shall be conducted under WHD’s OSHAct authority.  It is not
appropriate to cite and sanction violations under different Acts for the same
violation(s).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note that S/O 5-96 specifies that WHD temporary labor
camp enforcement under the OSHAct is  limited to those agricultural
establishments where employees are engaged in “agricultural employment” as
defined by MSPA at 29 USC 1802(3) (See also 29 CFR 500.20(e)), regardless of
the number of employees, including employees engaged in hand packing of produce
into containers, whether done on the ground, on a moving machine, or in a
temporary packing shed, except OSHA retains jurisdiction over agricultural temporary
labor camps for employees engaged in egg, poultry, or red meat production, or
post-harvest processing of agricultural or horticultural commodities.  Again,
WHD authority under the OSHAct is not limited to whether the workers are
migrant or seasonal agricultural workers as those terms are defined under the
MSPA – but whether the work being performed by the workers constitutes
“agricultural employment” as that term is defined under MSPA.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>36e01 - OSHAct Temporary Labor Camp Provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employers providing temporary housing to workers must
meet applicable OSHA standards for health and safety.  The substantive housing
requirements are found at 29 CFR 1910.142.  These standards are enforced under
OSHAct, MSPA, or the H-2A program for housing built or under construction after
April 3, 1980 or contracted to be built after March 4, 1980.  No change occurred
in the substantive housing provisions with the assumption of OSHA enforcement
authority.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 1910.142</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>36e02 - Housing Must Be Related to Employment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Housing shall be treated as employment-related if:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The employer
requires employees to live in the housing; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The isolated
location of the work or the lack of economically comparable alternative housing
makes it a practical necessity to use employer provided housing; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The housing is
provided or made available as a benefit to the employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   OSHAct
standards apply if any of the following factors indicate that the operation of
the camp is directly related to the employment of those persons using the
housing:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The housing is
provided free or at low cost; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The housing is owned,
controlled or provided by the employer; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  No other alternative
housing is reasonably accessible to the employees considering the distance from
the alternative housing to the worksite, the absence of transportation from the
alternative housing to the worksite, or the cost of the alternative housing; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The housing is made
available to ensure that the business is provided with an adequate supply of
labor; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  The employees living
in the housing are required to work for the employer upon demand.</p>

<h3>36e03 - No Minimum Number of Employees Required Under OSHAct Temporary
Housing Standard.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>OSHAct housing standards apply for all covered
agricultural employment without regard to the number of employees housed. The
11-or-more employees requirement for field sanitation does not apply to
temporary labor camp housing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 500.132(a)(1)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>36e04 - Rent Charged For Housing.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Any rent charged for housing, whether investigated
under MSPA or OSHAct, must meet the requirements under MSPA for fully disclosed
deductions, and must comport with FLSA 3(m) for reasonable costs for facilities
provided, if those Acts apply to the employment.  (See FOH 30c13.)  Housing for
H-2A covered workers must be provided at no cost to the workers who are not
reasonably able to return to their permanent residence.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>36e05 - Substantive Housing Requirements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The substantive OSHAct housing requirements are found
at 29 CFR 1910.142.</p>

<h3>36f00 - Glossary.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Familiarity with the following terms is essential to the
proper interpretation and application of the FS and TLC standards under the
OSHAct:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Commerce means
trade, traffic, commerce, transportation, or communication among the several
States, or District of Columbia, or a possession of the United States other
than the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or between points in the same
State but through a point outside thereof.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 652 (3)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   As used in the
OSHAct, the terms affects commerce and affecting commerce are, for all intents
and purposes, synonymous. (Note:  Affects commerce appears in the statutory
definition of employee, and affecting commerce is in the definition of
employer.)  Although not defined in the statute, both affects commerce and affecting
commerce describe the breadth of activities relative to commerce which govern
whether the Act applies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Conceptually, the terms affects and affecting
commerce include, but are more expansive than, the FLSA term engaged in
commerce or the production of goods for commerce.  OSHA, the Occupational
Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC) and the courts have consistently
construed affects and affecting commerce so as to have the broadest possible
application.</p>

or operator of any agricultural establishment in advance of production for the
purchase of a crop and exercises substantial control over production; or 3)
recruits and supervises employees or is responsible for the management and
condition of an agricultural establishment.  NOTE:  The term agricultural
employer is not synonymous with the term as defined in MSPA – see section 3(2)

<p>(m) Hand-labor operations
refers to agricultural activities or agricultural operations performed by hand
or with hand tools.  Except for purposes of 29 CFR 1928.110(c)(2)(iii), the
term also includes other activities or operations performed in conjunction with
hand labor in the field.  Activities such as hand-cultivation, hand-weeding,
hand-planting and hand-harvesting of vegetables, nuts, fruits, seedlings or
other crops, including mushrooms, and the hand-packing of produce into
containers, whether done on the ground, on a moving machine or in a temporary
packing shed located in the field, are all examples of hand-labor operations. 
The term does not however include such activities as logging operations, the
care or feeding of livestock, or hand-labor operations in permanent structures
such as canning facilities or packing houses.</p>

Verification refers to regulatory standards enforced by OSHA which require a
cited employer to provide certification (and in certain instances
documentation) demonstrating that each cited violation has been abated.  (See
29 CFR 1903.19)  WHD’s role in the abatement verification process consists of:
(1) informing employers of the requirements; and (2) referring allegations of
non-compliance with the abatement verification requirements to OSHA for further
action.  WHD does not enforce the abatement verification requirements.</p>

<h3>39a00 - Statutory and regulatory
provisions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Purpose
of the FMLA</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Family and
Medical Leave Act (FMLA, or the Act), Public Law 103-3, 107 Stat. 6
(29 USC. 2601 et seq.), was enacted on February 5, 1993, and became
effective for most covered employers on August 5, 1993.  The FMLA is intended
to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote
the stability and economic security of families, and to promote national
interests in preserving family integrity.  The Act is intended to accomplish
these purposes in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of
employers, and that is consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Statute</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The FMLA entitles
eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for
specified family and medical reasons with continuation of group health
insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had
not taken leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     Eligible
employees are entitled to twelve (12) workweeks of leave in a 12-month period
for:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     The
birth of a child and to care for the newborn child within one year of birth,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     The
placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care and to care
for the newly placed child within one year of placement,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.     To
care for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health
condition,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.     A
serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the
essential functions of his or her job, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5.     Any
qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son,
daughter, or parent is a military member on “covered active duty.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Eligible
employees who are the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a
covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness are entitled to twenty-six
(26) workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for the covered
servicemember (military caregiver leave).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2612</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.112</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The WHD is
responsible for administering and enforcing the FMLA for most employees.  Most
federal and certain congressional employees are also covered by the law but are
subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management or
Congress.   See FOH 39b04.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5 USC 6381 et seq.</p>
<p>5 CFR part 630</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Amendments</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The FMLA was
amended January 28, 2008 by Section 585(a) of the National Defense
Authorization Act for FY 2008, Public Law 110-181 (FY 2008 NDAA).  This
amendment expanded the FMLA to include special military family leave provisions,
i.e., “qualifying exigency” and “military caregiver” leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Further
amendments to the FMLA were enacted on October 28, 2009 by section 565(a) of
the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2010, Public Law 111-84 (FY 2010
NDAA), amending the military family leave provisions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  On December 21,
2009, the FMLA was amended by the Airline Flight Crew Technical Corrections
Act, Public Law 111-119 (AFCTCA), providing a special eligibility requirement for
airline flight crew members and flight attendants (“airline flight crew
employees”).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Regulations</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Title 29, Part 825 of
the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is the official source for regulatory information
concerning the application of the FMLA.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39a01 - Geographical scope.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The FMLA’s
coverage extends to any State of the United States, the District of Columbia,
and to any territory or possession of the United States. (Section 101(3)
of the FMLA defines the term “State” to have the same meaning as defined in § 3(c)
of the Fair Labor Standards Act.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees
of U.S. firms stationed at worksites outside the United States, its
territories, or possessions are not protected by the FMLA, nor are such employees
counted for purposes of determining employer coverage or employee eligibility
with respect to worksites inside the United States.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Foreign
firms operating in the U.S. are subject to the FMLA with respect to U.S. locations
and employees.  The foreign firm’s employees working outside the U.S. are not
counted in determining employer coverage or employee eligibility.</p>

<h3>39a02 - FMLA protections.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Unpaid leave</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The FMLA allows
eligible employees of covered employers to take job-protected, unpaid leave, or
to substitute appropriate earned or accrued paid leave, for up to a total of 12
workweeks in a 12-month period for qualifying FMLA reasons, or up to 26
workweeks in a single 12-month period for military caregiver leave.  See FOH
39d.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2612(a)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.100</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Maintenance
of health benefits</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During any FMLA
leave, an employer must maintain the employee’s pre-existing coverage under any
group health plan on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided
if the employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave period.  See
FOH 39i.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2614(c)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.209</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Job restoration</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On return from FMLA leave,
an employee is entitled to be restored to the same position the employee held
when leave commenced, or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits,
pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. The job-restoration
protections of the FMLA are contingent upon the employee’s continued ability to
perform the essential functions of his or her job.  See FOH 39j.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2614(a)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.214</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39a03 - Waiver of rights.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An employee cannot
waive his or her prospective (future) rights under the FMLA and an employer is
prohibited from attempting to induce an employee to waive such rights. 
Employees cannot trade their rights under FMLA for another benefit offered by
the employer.  This does not, however, prevent the settlement or release of
FMLA claims by employees based on past employer conduct.  Any such private settlement
of past claims does not need the approval of the Department of Labor or a
court.</p>

<p>73 FR 67934,
67986-67988</p>

<h3>39b00 - General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Covered
employers</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer covered
by the FMLA is any person engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity
affecting commerce, who employs 50 or more employees for each working day
during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding
calendar year.  Employers who meet the FMLA 50-employee coverage requirement
are deemed to be “engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting
commerce” within the meaning of the FMLA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2611(4)(A)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.104(b)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   “Employ”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The definition of
“employ” is the same as used in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and
includes instances when an individual is “suffered or permitted” to work.  Employees
whose names appear on the payroll are considered to be employed each working
day of the week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2611(3)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.105(a)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Counting
employees for private employer coverage</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any employee whose
name appears on the employer’s payroll will count toward the 50-employee
coverage requirement even if the employee has received no compensation for the
week, or was on paid or unpaid leave.  Part-time employees maintained on the
payroll are considered employed for each working day of the week.  Employees on
paid or unpaid leave, including FMLA leave, leaves of absence, disciplinary
suspension, etc., are counted as long as there is a reasonable expectation that
the employee will return to active employment.  If there is no
employer/employee relationship, such as when the employee is laid-off, the
individual is not counted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.105(b) - (c)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Volunteers</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unpaid volunteers do
not appear on the payroll and do not meet the definition of an “employee” and,
therefore, are not counted when determining employer coverage or employee
eligibility.   See FOH 10b03.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHD Non-Administrator
Letter FMLA-7 October 8, 1993</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Joint and
temporary employees</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employees who are
jointly employed by two employers must be counted by both employers in
determining employer coverage and employee eligibility under the FMLA,
regardless of whether maintained on only one or both of the employers’ payrolls.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Temporary employees
are ordinarily considered to be jointly employed by both the temporary
employment agency and the worksite employer and are counted for coverage
purposes by both entities.  See FOH 39b01 and 39c03.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.106</p>
<p>WHD Opinion Letter
FMLA 2004-1-A</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Firms
with multiple departments/divisions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Corporations
are single employers under the FMLA and all employees of the corporation, at all
locations, are counted for coverage purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Separate
entities or corporations may be parts of a single employer for FMLA purposes if
they meet the “integrated employer” test.  Factors to be considered in
determining if separate entities are an integrated employer include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     Common
management,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Interrelation
between operations,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     Centralized
control of labor relations, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.     Degree
of common ownership or financial control.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.104(c)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Change in
coverage status</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once a private
employer meets the 50-employee requirement for FMLA coverage, the employer
remains covered until it has no longer employed 50 employees for 20 workweeks
in the current and preceding calendar year.  For example, an employer who
employed 50 or more employees for 20 workweeks in one year would continue to be
a covered employer under the FMLA the following year even if it now employed
fewer than 50 employees because it still would meet the requirement of 50
employees in any 20 workweeks for the preceding year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.105(f)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39b01 - Joint employment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Where two
or more businesses exercise some control over the work or working conditions of
the employee, the businesses may be joint employers under the FMLA.  The
relationship is viewed in its totality in making a determination of whether or
not a joint employment relationship exists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   A
professional employer organization (PEO) that contracts with client employers
to perform administrative functions does not enter into a joint relationship
with the employees of its                    client companies when it merely
performs administrative functions.  The determination of whether a PEO is a
joint employer depends upon the economic realities of the situation and all the
facts and circumstances.  For example, if the PEO exercises control of the
client’s employees or benefits from the work that the employees perform, such
facts may indicate that the PEO would be a joint employer with the client
employer.  Where a PEO is a joint employer, the client employer is commonly the
primary employer.<a name="1"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   In joint
employment situations, only the primary employer is responsible for giving
required notices to its employees, providing FMLA leave, and maintaining health
benefits. Factors considered in determining which is the primary employer
include authority/responsibility to hire and fire, assign/place the employee,
make payroll, and provide employment benefits.  The primary employer is
responsible for job restoration and the secondary employer is responsible for
accepting the employee returning from leave.  For example, if the joint
employment relationship is that of temporary/leased employee and the secondary
employer continued to use the agency to fill the position, the employee is
entitled to return to the position he or she held with the secondary employer. 
If the secondary employer did not fill the position from that agency, then the
primary employer must place the employee in an equivalent position.</p>

FMLA 2004-1-A</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39b02 - Successor in interest.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When an employer meets
the definition of successor in interest (see 29 CFR 825.107(a)) employee
entitlements are the same as if the employee were continuously employed by a
single employer. This includes continuing leave begun while employed by the
predecessor and counting hours of service and periods of employment for the predecessor
when determining employee eligibility for FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.107</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39b03 - Public agencies, general.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   All
public agencies are covered employers under the FMLA without regard to the
number of employees.  However, employees of public agencies must meet all of
the FMLA’s eligibility criteria in order to take protected leave.  See FOH 39c.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   “Public
agency” is defined under the FLSA, 29 USC 203(x).  The
determination of whether an entity is a public agency, as distinguished from a
private employer, is determined by whether the agency has taxing authority, or
whether the chief administrative officer or board, etc., is elected by the
voters-at-large or their appointment is subject to approval by an elected
official.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   A State
or political subdivision of a State constitutes a single public agency.
 For example, a State is a single employer; a county is a single employer,
a city is a single employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>See also FOH 39c03(c)(1)</p>

<p>29 CFR 825.108</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39b04 - Public agencies, federal government.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The federal
government is a covered employer under the FMLA without regard to the number of
employees.  However, most federal employees are covered under Title II of the
FMLA and are not under the jurisdiction of the Wage and Hour Division.  The
Department of Labor’s enforcement authority under Title I of the FMLA excludes
any federal officer or employee covered under subchapter V of Chapter 63 of
Title 5 of the United States Code.  Such federal employees are covered by Title
II of the FMLA, which is administered by the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM), pursuant to regulations at 5 CFR part 630.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   However,
the Wage and Hour Division has enforcement authority under Title I of the FMLA
for the following federal executive branch employees:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Employees of
the Postal Service,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Employees of
the Postal Regulatory Commission,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Employees of
the Federal Aviation Administration</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  A part-time
employee who does not have an established tour of duty, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  An employee who
is serving under an intermittent or temporary appointment with a time
limitation of one year or less.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.109(b)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Additionally,
employees of other federal executive agencies not covered by Title II of the
FMLA will also be under the jurisdiction of the Wage and Hour Division.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   While
employees of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Library of
Congress are covered by Title I of the FMLA, the Comptroller General of the
United States and the Librarian of Congress, respectively, have responsibility
for the administration of the FMLA with respect to these employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2611(4)(A)(iv),
2617(f)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   The
Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA) protects the employees of the
U.S. Congress and its associated employees. The CAA applies to the following
offices and their employees: House of Representatives (both Washington, D.C.
and state district office staff); Senate (both Washington, D.C. and state
district office staff); Capitol Police; Capitol Guide Service; Congressional
Budget Office; Office of the Architect of the Capitol; Office of the Attending
Physician; and the Office of Compliance.  The Office of Compliance is an
independent non-partisan agency established to administer and enforce the CAA.
The Office of Compliance has responsibility for the administration of the FMLA
with respect to employees covered by the CAA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Employees
of the judicial branch of the United States are covered by Title I and under
the enforcement authority of the Wage and Hour Division if they are employed in
a unit which has employees in the competitive service, such as employees of the
U.S. Tax Court.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.109</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39b05 - Schools.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Public and private
elementary and secondary schools are covered entities under the FMLA.  Such
schools are not subject to the FMLA 50-employee coverage requirement.  Other
schools such as public and private colleges and universities and day care
providers are subject to the same criteria as private employers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2618</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.600 - 825.604</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39b06 - Members of the military.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The U.S. military is not
a covered employer under the FMLA and therefore military members are not
entitled to take leave under the FMLA.  However, civilian employees of the
military departments are considered employees of a public agency.</p>

FMLA-covered employer,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Has been
employed by the employer for at least 12 months,</p>

of eligibility determination</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employee eligibility
is determined at the commencement of the first instance of leave for each
FMLA-qualifying reason in the applicable 12-month period.  An employee remains
eligible for leave for that same qualifying reason during that applicable
12-month period.  Eligibility may be re-tested when leave is for a different
qualifying reason within that same 12-month period, or with the first instance
of FMLA leave for any reason in a new 12-month period.</p>

eligibility criteria are determined</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The
determination of whether an employee has been employed for at least 12 months
and has at least the required hours of service is made as of the date the FMLA
leave is to start.</p>
<p> </p>

need for leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.110(e)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  An employee may
be on non-FMLA leave at the time he or she meets the 12-month of employment
requirement.  In that event, any portion of the leave taken for an
FMLA-qualifying reason after the employee becomes eligible would be FMLA leave.</p>

<h3>39c01 - 12 months of service.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   12 months
need not be consecutive</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  An employee’s
12 months of employment for the employer need not be consecutive.  However, an
employer is not required to count periods of employment prior to a break in
service of seven years or more, unless the break in service is caused by the
employee’s fulfillment of a Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment
Rights Act (USERRA) covered service obligation, or a written agreement,
including a collective bargaining agreement, exists concerning the employer’s
intention to rehire the employee after the break in service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  An employer may
choose to consider employment prior to a break in service of seven years.  If
the employer chooses to recognize such periods of employment, the employer is
required to do so with respect to all employees with similar breaks in service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The FMLA
requires employers to keep records for three years (see FOH 39k).  If the
employer retains records for the seven-year period, it may use those records in
determining the employee’s eligibility.  However, if the employer retains records
only for the required three years, it may base its initial determination on the
retained records.  If based on these records the employee is determined not to
be eligible, the employee will have to submit proof of employment in years four
through seven to demonstrate eligibility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Such proof might include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     W-2
forms,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Pay
stubs,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     A
statement which identifies the dates of prior employment, name of employee’s
supervisor and/or co-workers, and similar information, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.     An
application for employment.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Intermittent,
casual or occasional employees</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For purposes of
determining if employees who work on an intermittent, casual, or occasional
basis meet the 12 months of service requirement, 52 weeks is equal to 12
months.  If an employee is maintained on the payroll for any part of a week,
the week counts as a week of employment.</p>

<h3>39c02 - Hours of service, general.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Hours
worked</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For most employees,
the 1,250 hours of service is determined according to the principles under the FLSA
for determining compensable hours of work (29 CFR part 785). 
Consequently, hours not actually worked such as paid or unpaid vacation and
sick leave (including FMLA-qualifying leave), holidays and other similar time
are not counted.  Overtime hours worked are counted toward FMLA eligibility.</p>

<p>WHD Non-Administrator
Letter FMLA-70 August 23, 1995</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   No record
of hours</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If accurate records
are not kept, the employer has the burden of showing that the employee has not met
the hours of service requirement in order to claim the employee is not eligible
for FMLA leave.  An employer must clearly show, for example, that bona fide
exempt employees under FLSA regulations 29 CFR part 541, such as full-time
teachers of an elementary or secondary school system, have not met the hours of
service requirement in order to claim that they are not entitled to FMLA leave. 
This is true even though the employer would not be required by the FLSA
regulations to keep records of the hours worked and even though the work may be
done outside the classroom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.110(c)(3)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Time for
military service</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pursuant to USERRA,
an employee returning from fulfilling a USERRA-covered military service
obligation is credited with the hours of service that would have been performed
but for the period of military service.  In order to determine the hours that
would have been worked (or, in the case of airline flight crew employees, would
have been paid) during the period of military service, the employee’s
pre-service work schedule can generally be used for calculations.</p>

<h3>39c03 - Employees within 75 miles.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Worksite</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employee’s
worksite is ordinarily the site the employee reports to, or from which the
employee’s work is assigned.  A worksite can refer to a simple location, a
group of buildings, such as a campus or industrial park, or to separate
facilities in geographic proximity to one another.  The 75 miles are measured
from the employee’s worksite by surface miles using surface transportation over
public streets, roads, highways and waterways by the shortest route possible.  If
surface transportation is not available between worksites, the distance is
measured by the most frequently used mode of transportation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.111(a)
- (b)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   No fixed
worksite</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For employees with no
fixed worksite, such as in the case for many construction workers,
transportation workers, and salespersons, the site to which they report, from
which their work is assigned, or the location to which they are assigned as
their home base, is their worksite.  An employee’s personal residence is not a
worksite.  In the case of employees who work from home under “telework” or
“flexi place arrangements” or others such as salespersons who may leave to work
from home and return to their residence, their worksite is the office to which
they report or from which their assignments are made.  If 50 employees are
employed within 75 miles from the employee’s official worksite, the employee meets
the requirements for that test, regardless of where the employee is currently
performing his or her duties.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.111(a)(2)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Public
agency employees</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  A State or
political subdivision of a State constitutes a single public agency for
purposes of determining employee eligibility.  For example, a State is a
single employer, a county is a single employer, a city is a single employer.  The
definition of “employee” does not include an individual who holds public
elective office in the State, is selected by an officeholder to be a member of
his or her personal staff, is appointed by an officeholder to serve on a
policymaking level, is an immediate adviser to an officeholder with respect to
legal powers, or is an employee in the legislative branch or body of the State
and is not employed by the legislative library.  Such employees are not
eligible for FMLA benefits and should not be counted in determining the number
of employees within 75 miles at the worksite of the employee requesting FMLA
leave.</p>

<h3>39c04 - Temporary employees jointly
employed.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employees
who are jointly employed by two employers must be counted by both employers in
determining employee eligibility, regardless of whether the jointly-employed
employees are maintained on only one or both of the employers’ payrolls.   A
temporary agency, as a primary employer, and its client are ordinarily
considered to be joint employers under the FMLA.  Day laborers supplied by a
temporary agency may also be jointly employed by the agency and the client firm
if there is a continuing employment relationship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Months
and hours of service</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the temporary
employee is subsequently hired directly by the client employer, any hours
previously worked for the temporary agency on the premises of the client
employer are counted toward eligibility for FMLA leave.  In addition, any
months previously worked on the premises of the client would likewise count
toward the 12 month eligibility test.</p>

<p>(c)   Employees
within 75 miles of worksite</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Generally, when an
employee is jointly employed by two or more employers, the employee’s worksite
is the primary employer’s office from which the employee is assigned or
reports.  However, if the employee has physically worked for at least one year
at a facility of a secondary employer, the employee’s worksite is that
secondary employer’s location.</p>

<h3>39d00 - Qualifying reasons for FMLA
leave.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Employers covered by
the FMLA are required to grant leave to an eligible employee:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   For the
birth of a child and to care for the newborn child,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   For the
placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care and to care
for the newly placed child,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   To care
for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Because
of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform any of
the essential functions of his or her job,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Because
of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse,
son, daughter, or parent is a military member on “covered active duty,” and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   To care
for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness when the employee is
the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of the servicemember.</p>

<h3>39d01 - Leave for birth or
pregnancy.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Eligible
employees are entitled to FMLA leave for pregnancy or the birth of a child.  Both
the mother and father are entitled to up to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave for the
birth and to be with the healthy newborn child (i.e., bonding time).  Leave for
bonding time must be completed during the 12-month period beginning on the date
of the birth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Pregnancy
and childbirth are also considered FMLA-qualifying serious health conditions.  The
mother is entitled to FMLA leave for incapacity due to pregnancy, for prenatal
care, or for her own serious health condition following the birth of the
child.  A husband is entitled to FMLA leave if he is needed to care for his
wife during her prenatal care or when she is incapacitated during pregnancy or
following the birth of the child.  Employees are not entitled to any additional
leave for twins or other multiple births.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHD Non-Administrator
Letter FMLA-45 October 14, 1994</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   FMLA
leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically
necessary due to the pregnancy or birth.  When the leave is for bonding time
with the newborn child, the employee may take the leave intermittently or on a
reduced leave schedule only if the employer agrees.</p>

<p>29 CFR 825.203</p>
<p>WHD Non-Administrator

<p>(d)   A husband
and wife who are eligible and employed by the same employer may be limited to a
combined total of 12 workweeks to care for the healthy child after birth.  See
FOH 39e03.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Leave to
bond with and care for a healthy newborn or newly placed child is distinguished
from leave to care for a son or daughter with a serious health condition.  An
employer may not require a medical certification for leave for bonding with a
child.  However, an employer may require the employee to submit documentation
of the relationship between the employee and the child.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.122(k)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   The FMLA
definition of “son or daughter” includes a child of a person standing in loco
parentis to the child.  Therefore, an employee who will assume the responsibilities
of a parent to the child may take FMLA leave for the birth of the child and to
bond with the child during the first 12 months following the birth.  See FOH 39d03(d)(4). 
Whether an individual stands in loco parentis to a child depends on the
particular facts of a given situation; however, a blood or legal relationship
is not required.  For example, an employee who is in a same-sex relationship
and who will share equally in the raising of a child with the child’s
biological parent would be entitled to leave for the child’s birth because he
or she will stand in loco parentis to the child.</p>

<h3>39d02 - Leave for placement of a
child for adoption or foster care.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Eligible
employees are entitled to up to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave for placement with
the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; such leave must
be taken within 12 months of the placement.  Adoption means legally and
permanently assuming the responsibility of raising a child as one’s own.  Foster
care is 24-hour care for children in substitution for, and away from, their
parents or guardian. Such placements involve state action, voluntary or
involuntary removal of the child from the parents or guardian, and an agreement
between the state and foster family that the family will care for the child. 
FMLA leave may be taken for a foster care placement of any duration.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employees
may take FMLA leave before the actual placement of a child if an absence from
work is required for the placement or adoption to proceed.  For example, FMLA
leave may be taken for required counseling sessions, court appearances or
consultations with an attorney or doctor representing the child.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Leave
taken after the placement of a healthy child for adoption or foster care may be
taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only with the employer’s
agreement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Multiple
placements for adoption or foster care in a single leave year are separate FMLA-qualifying
events.  However, employees are not entitled to more than 12 weeks of leave for
any combination of qualifying reasons in a single leave year.  See FOH 39d09
for special rules applicable to military caregiver leave.  Leave for each
individual child placed must be completed within 12 months of the date of the
placement.</p>

placement rather than when the subsequent adoption occurs.</p>

of a parent to an adopted or foster child is entitled to FMLA leave to bond
with the child during the first 12 months following the placement, regardless
of blood or legal relationship.  For example, if one member of an unmarried
couple adopts a child, and the other member of the couple will be assuming the
responsibilities of a parent towards the child, then both individuals would be
entitled to take FMLA leave for the placement of the child.  See FOH 39d03(d)(4).</p>

<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Spouse</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     Spouse
means a husband or wife as defined or recognized under state law for purposes
of marriage in the State where the employee resides, including common law
marriage and same sex marriage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2611(13)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.122(b)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     WHD
Non-Administrator Letter FMLA-98 (Nov. 18, 1998) states, in part, that the FMLA
definition of spouse is limited by the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). On June
26, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court held in United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct.
2675 (2013), that the referenced provision of DOMA was unconstitutional;
therefore, the above definition of spouse took effect.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Son or daughter</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     The
FMLA defines a son or daughter as a biological, adopted, or foster child, a
stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis who
is under age 18; or 18 or older and incapable of self-care because of a
physical or mental disability at the time that FMLA leave is to commence.  It
does not matter if the onset of the disability occurs before or after the son
or daughter turns 18 for purposes of FMLA leave, provided that the disability
exists and renders the adult child incapable of self-care at the time the
employee’s leave is to commence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2611(12)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.122(d)</p>
<p>WHD Administrator’s
Interpretation No. 2013-1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Physical
or mental disability</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Physical or mental
disability means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one
or more of the major life activities of an individual. Regulations at 29 CFR
1630.2 (h), (i) and (j), issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
under the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq., define
these terms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Americans with
Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) significantly broadened the
scope of the ADA’s definition of disability.  Because the FMLA’s definition of
an adult son or daughter relies on the ADA’s definition of disability, the
changes to the definition of disability set forth in the ADAAA and its
implementing regulations apply to the definition of a son or daughter 18 years
of age or older under the FMLA.  See WHD Administrator’s Interpretation No. 2013-1.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     “Substantially
limits” does not require that the impairment prevents, or severely or
significantly restricts, the individual in performing a major life activity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     Major
life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing
manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting,
bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking,
communicating, interacting with others, and working.  Major life activities
also include the operation of major bodily functions, such as functions of the
immune system, normal cell growth, and digestive, brain, respiratory,
neurological and reproductive functions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.     The
use of mitigating measures to ameliorate the effects of an impairment may not
be considered when determining the limitations on a major life activity, except
for the use of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.     An
impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if the impairment
would substantially limit a major life activity when active.  Examples include,
but are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, asthma, epilepsy, diabetes, lupus,
post traumatic stress disorder and cancer in remission.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5.     There
is no minimum duration of time required for an impairment to be considered a
disability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6.     The
term disability is to be construed in favor of broad coverage when determining
if an individual has a disability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>7.     The
EEOC’s regulations provide that some impairments will virtually always qualify
as disabilities because, by their very nature, they substantially limit at
least one major life activity.  Impairments that should easily be concluded to
be substantially limiting include deafness, blindness, intellectual disability,
missing limbs or mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair,
autism, cancer, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”) infection, muscular dystrophy, major depressive
disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive
compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     Incapable
of self-care</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Incapable of
self-care means that the individual requires active assistance or supervision
to provide daily self-care in three or more “activities of daily living” (ADLs)
or “instrumental activities of daily living” (IADLs) due to a disability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     Activities
of daily living include adaptive activities such as caring appropriately for
one’s grooming and hygiene, bathing, dressing and eating.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     Instrumental
activities of daily living include cooking, cleaning, shopping, taking public
transportation, paying bills, maintaining a residence, using telephones and
directories, using a post office, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.     These
lists of ADLs and IADLs are not exhaustive and additional activities should
also be considered in determining whether an adult son or daughter is incapable
of self-care due to a disability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.     The
determination of whether an adult son or daughter is incapable of self-care is
made based on the individual’s condition at the time the employee requests
leave.  The determination should include, for example, the current effects of
any episodic impairment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.     There
are special definitions of son and daughter applicable to military family leave
that are not limited by age.  See 29 CFR 825.122(h) and (i).</p>

<p>Parent means a biological, adoptive, step or
foster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco parentis to
the employee when the employee was a son or daughter (as defined by the FMLA). 
This term does not include parents-in-law.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2611(7)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.122(c)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is a special definition of parent
applicable to military caregiver leave.  29 CFR 825.122(j).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  In Loco
Parentis</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In loco parentis means in the place of a
parent.  An employee who stands in loco parentis to a child is entitled to
leave for bonding purposes or if leave is needed to care for the child with a
serious health condition.  An eligible employee is also entitled to FMLA leave
to care for someone who stood in loco parentis to the employee when he or she was
a child.  Whether an in loco parentis relationship exists is dependent upon the
specific facts of the case.  Factors to be looked at in determining whether an in
loco parentis relationship exists include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     The
age of the child,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     The
degree to which the child is dependent on the person claiming in loco parentis
status,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     The
amount of support, if any, provided, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.     The
extent to which duties commonly associated with parenthood are exercised.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A blood or legal relationship is irrelevant to
determining in loco parentis status.  For example, an employee who will share
equally in the raising of an adopted child with a same-sex partner, but who
does not have a legal relationship with the child, stands in loco parentis to
the child.  In addition, the fact that a child has a biological mother and
father does not prevent a finding that another individual stands in loco
parentis to the child.</p>

<p>WHD Administrator’s Interpretation No. 2010-3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Leave for
other family members</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Generally, an
employee is not entitled to FMLA leave to care for other family members with
serious health conditions, such as siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, or
parents-in-law.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Exceptions may
arise where the employee can document the existence of an in loco parentis
relationship.  For example, an employee may take FMLA leave to care for an aunt
or uncle with a serious health condition if the aunt or uncle stood in loco
parentis to the employee when the employee was a child.  See FOH 39d09(b)(4)
for military caregiver “next of kin” definition.</p>

<h3>39d04 - Employee’s own serious
health condition.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An
eligible employee may take up to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave if he or she is
unable to perform the functions of his or her job because of a serious health
condition.  An employee is unable to perform the functions of his or her
position if the health care provider finds that the employee is unable to work
at all or is unable to perform any one of the essential functions of the
employee’s position within the meaning of the ADA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  An employee who
must be absent from work to receive medical treatment for a serious health
condition is considered to be unable to perform the essential functions of the
position during the absence for treatment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  An employee who
suffers from a serious health condition that does not prevent him or her from
performing the essential functions of the position is not entitled to FMLA
leave.  Similarly, an employee who cannot perform one or more of the essential
functions of the position, but whose condition does not meet the statutory and
regulatory definition of a serious health condition, is not entitled to FMLA
leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.123</p>
<p>WHD Non-Administrator Letter FMLA-77 January
30, 1996</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   An
employer may provide a statement of the essential functions of the employee’s
position held at the time notice is given or leave commenced, whichever is
earlier, for the employee’s health care provider to review during the medical
certification process.When such statement is provided, a sufficient medical
certification must specify what functions of the employee’s position the
employee is unable to perform so that the employer can then determine whether
the employee is unable to perform one or more essential functions of the
position.</p>

<h3>39d05 - Documentation of
relationship.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   For
purposes of confirmation of family relationship, the employer may require the
employee giving notice of the need for FMLA leave to provide reasonable
documentation or statement of family relationship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   This
documentation may take the form of a simple statement from the employee, a
child’s birth certificate, a court document, or other documentation connected
with a foster care placement, such as the agreement between the state and the
foster care provider.  The employer is permitted to examine documentation, but
the employee is entitled to the return of the official document submitted for
this purpose.</p>

<h3>39d06 - Serious health condition.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   General</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  For FMLA
purposes:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     A
serious health condition means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or
mental condition that involves inpatient care or continuing treatment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     “Incapacity”
means the inability to work, attend school, or perform other regular daily
activities due to a serious health condition or its treatment or recovery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     “Treatment”
includes examinations to determine if a serious health condition exists,
evaluations of the condition, and actual treatment by or under the supervision
of a health care provider to resolve or alleviate the condition.  An
examination or treatment requires a visit to the health care provider to
qualify under FMLA; a telephone conversation is not sufficient.  Treatment does
not include routine physical, eye, or dental exams.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The FMLA is not
intended to cover short-term conditions for which treatment and recovery are
very brief.  Unless complications arise, the following conditions generally
will not meet the definition of an FMLA serious health condition:  the common
cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other than
migraine, routine dental or orthodontia problems, periodontal disease.  The
objective test defining what constitutes a serious health condition under the
FMLA is controlling.  Common ailments such as those listed above ordinarily
will not qualify for FMLA leave because they generally will not satisfy these
regulatory criteria.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>73 FR 67934, 67946</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Conditions for
which cosmetic treatments are administered, such as for acne or plastic
surgery, do not qualify unless inpatient hospital care is required or
complications develop that result in the condition meeting the definition of a
serious health condition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2611(11)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.113</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Inpatient
care</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Inpatient care means
an overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility,
including any period of incapacity or any subsequent treatment in connection
with such inpatient care.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.114</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Continuing
treatment</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A serious health
condition involving continuing treatment by a health care provider includes any
one of the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Incapacity and
treatment</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     A
period of incapacity of more than 3 consecutive, full calendar days, and any
subsequent treatment or period of related incapacity that also involves:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     An
in-person treatment by a health care provider within seven days of the first
day of incapacity followed by at least one more in-person treatment within 30
days, unless extenuating circumstances exist; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     An
in-person treatment by a health care provider within seven days of the first
day of incapacity which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the
supervision of the health care provider.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.     Whether
additional treatment visits or a regimen of continuing treatment are necessary
within the 30-day period is to be determined by the health care provider.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     A
regimen of continuing treatment includes, for example, a course of prescription
medication or therapy requiring special equipment.  It does not include only
the taking of over-the-counter medications, bed-rest, or drinking fluids, exercise,
and other similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a health
care provider, even if these are recommended by the health care provider.</p>

<p>29 CFR 825.115(a)</p>
<p>WHD Opinion Letter
FMLA-87 December 12, 1996</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Pregnancy or
prenatal care</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     Any
period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care.  Absences
occasioned by prenatal visits to a health care provider, severe morning
sickness, or other complications of pregnancy constitute serious health
conditions under the FMLA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Absences
attributable to incapacity for pregnancy or prenatal care qualify for FMLA
leave even though the employee or the covered family member does not receive
treatment from a health care provider during the absence and even if the
absence does not last more than three consecutive, full calendar days.  For
example, an employee who is pregnant may be unable to report to work because of
severe morning sickness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.115(b) and
(f), 825.120(a)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Chronic
conditions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     Any
period of incapacity or treatment due to a condition which requires at least
two visits per year for treatment by a health care provider, or a nurse under
direct supervisions of a health care provider, and that continues over an
extended period of time (including recurring episodes of the same underlying
condition).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Examples
of chronic conditions that may meet the FMLA definition of a serious health
condition include but are not limited to asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, migraine
headaches, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     Chronic
conditions frequently involve intermittent leave or leave on a reduced
schedule.  Absences attributable to incapacity for chronic conditions qualify
for FMLA leave even though the employee or the covered family member does not
receive treatment from a health care provider during the absence and even if
the absence does not last more than three consecutive, full calendar days.  For
example, an employee with asthma may be unable to report for work due to the
onset of an asthma attack or because the employee’s health care provider has
advised the employee to stay home when the pollen count exceeds a certain level.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.115(c) and
(f)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Permanent or
long-term conditions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     A
period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition for
which treatment may not be effective.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     The
employee or family member must be under the continuing supervision of, but need
not be receiving active treatment by, a health care provider.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     Examples
of permanent or long-term conditions include but are not limited to
Alzheimer’s, a severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.115(d)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Conditions
requiring multiple treatments</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     Any
period of absence to receive multiple treatments (or a period of recovery from
treatments) by a health care provider, or under the orders of a health care
provider, for:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     Restorative
surgery after an accident or other injury, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     A
condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three
consecutive, full calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or
treatment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Examples
of such conditions may include but are not limited to chemotherapy or radiation
for cancer; physical therapy for severe arthritis; or dialysis for kidney
disease.</p>

<p>29 CFR 825.115(e)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39d07 - Treatment for substance
abuse.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Treatment
for substance abuse may be a serious health condition for purposes of FMLA if the
regulatory definition of a serious health condition is met.  FMLA leave,
however, may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse that is provided
by a health care provider or by a provider of health care services on referral
by a health care provider.  Absence because of the employee’s use of the
substance, rather than treatment, does not qualify for FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Treatment
for substance abuse does not prevent an employer from taking employment action
against an employee.  The employer may not take action against an employee
because the employee has exercised the right to take FMLA for treatment.  If,
however, the employer has an established policy applied in a nondiscriminatory
manner that has been communicated to all employees that provides that under certain
circumstances an employee may be terminated for substance abuse, an employee
may be terminated pursuant to that policy whether or not the employee is
presently taking FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   An
employee may take FMLA leave to care for a covered family member who is
receiving treatment for substance abuse and the employer may not take action
against the employee for such leave.</p>

<p>b.     Providing
care</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Leave may be taken to
provide care on an urgent, immediate need basis for a parent of a military

meetings</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Leave may be taken to
attend meetings with staff at a care facility for a parent of the military
member, such as meetings with hospice or social service providers, when the
parent is incapable of self-care and such meetings are necessitated by the
covered active duty of the military member.  FMLA leave is not available for
routine or regular meetings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.     Parent
of the military member</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For purposes of
parental care leave, a parent of the military member means a biological,
adoptive, step or foster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in
loco parentis to the military member when the member was under 18 years of age.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The military member
must be the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of the employee requesting leave. 
No relationship is required between the parent of the military member on
covered active duty and the employee requesting leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>f.      Incapable
of self-care</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For purposes of leave
for parental care, the parent of the military member must be incapable of
self-care.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     A
parent who is incapable of self-care means that the parent requires active
assistance or supervision to provide daily self-care in three or more of the
activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     Activities
of daily living include, but are not limited to, adaptive activities such as
caring appropriately for one’s grooming and hygiene, bathing, dressing, and
eating. Instrumental activities of daily living include, but are not limited
to, cooking, cleaning, shopping, taking public transportation, paying bills,
maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, using a post office,

<h3>39d09 - Military caregiver leave.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   General</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Eligible
employees who are the spouse, parent, son, daughter, or next of kin of a
covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness are entitled to up to 26
workweeks of FMLA leave in a “single 12-month period” to care for that covered
servicemember.  Covered servicemembers include current members of the Regular
or Reserve components of the Armed Forces and certain veterans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2611(15), 2612(a)(3)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employers were not required to provide military
caregiver leave for the care of a veteran until the Department defined a
qualifying serious injury or illness of a veteran through regulations and those
regulations became effective.  Regulations defining a qualifying serious injury
or illness of a veteran became effective on March 8, 2013.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>78 FR 8848</p>
<p>78 FR 8834</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A covered servicemember means:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     Current
servicemember</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A current member of
the Armed Forces of the United States, including a member of the National Guard
or Reserves, who has a serious injury or illness for which he or she is
undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is in outpatient
status, or is on the temporary disability retired list for a serious injury or
illness.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>b.     Veteran</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A veteran who is undergoing
medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a serious injury or illness and
who was a member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard
or Reserves, and was discharged or released under conditions other than
dishonorable at any time during the period of five years preceding the date on
which the employee first takes leave to care for the veteran (the five-year
period).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     Veteran
discharged on or after March 8, 2013</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a veteran
discharged on or after March 8, 2013, the five-year period for FMLA military
caregiver leave begins on the date of discharge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     Veteran
discharged between October 28, 2009 and March 8, 2013</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a veteran
discharged between October 28, 2009 and March 8, 2013, the five-year period for
FMLA military caregiver leave begins on [effective date of Final Rule].</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.     Veteran
discharged before October 28, 2009</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a veteran
discharged before October 28, 2009 , the period between October 28, 2009 and March
8, 2013 does not count toward the determination of the five-year period for
covered veteran status.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this case, the
veteran will have the same amount of time available on March 8, 2013 as he or
she would have had on October 28, 2009.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A.    For
example, if a servicemember retired on October 28, 2007, he or she would have
had three years remaining of the five-year period on October 28, 2009. 
Therefore, the family member requesting FMLA leave will have three years to
begin military caregiver leave starting on March 8, 2013.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>B.    However,
if a servicemember was discharged on December 1, 2003, the discharge would have
occurred more than five years prior to October 28, 2009 and the veteran would
not be a covered veteran for military caregiver leave purposes.</p>

injury or illness for a covered servicemember is:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     Current
servicemember’s serious injury or illness</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     An
injury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that may render
the servicemember medically unfit to perform the duties of his or her office,
grade, rank, or rating, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     An
injury or illness that existed before the beginning of the servicemember’s
active duty and was aggravated by service in line of duty on active duty in the
Armed Forces that may render the member medically unfit to perform the duties
of his or her office, grade, rank, or rating.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>b.     Veteran’s
serious injury or illness</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     An
injury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that that
manifested itself before or after the servicemember became a veteran and that
is:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A.    A
continuation of a serious injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated
when the veteran was a member of the Armed Forces and rendered the
servicemember unable to perform the duties of the servicemember’s office,
grade, rank, or rating, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>B.    A
physical or mental condition for which the veteran has received a U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs Service-Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50
percent or greater, and the VASRD rating is based, in whole or in part, on the
condition precipitating the need for military caregiver leave, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>C.    A
physical or mental condition that substantially impairs the veteran’s ability
to work because of a disability or disabilities related to military service, or
would do so absent treatment, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>D.    An
injury that is the basis for the veteran’s enrollment in the Department of
Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     An
injury or illness that existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty
and was aggravated by service in line of duty on active duty in the Armed
Forces that otherwise meets any of the definitions in A – D above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2611(18)(B)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.127(c)(2)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  26 workweeks of
leave in a 12-month period</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     The
single 12-month period for military caregiver leave begins on the first day the
employee takes FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember and ends 12
months after that date, regardless of the method used by the employer to
determine the employee’s 12 workweeks of leave entitlement for other
FMLA-qualifying reasons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, if an
employee first takes military caregiver leave beginning June 1, 2013, the
employee’s single 12-month period for military caregiver leave is June 1, 2013
through May 31, 2014, regardless of the fact that the employer may use the
calendar year for tracking FMLA leave usage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If an employee does
not take all of his or her 26 workweeks to care for a covered servicemember
during this single 12-month period, the remaining leave is forfeited.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     The
single 12-month period is applied on a per-covered servicemember, per-injury
basis.  Therefore, an eligible employee may take more than one period of 26
workweeks of leave if the leave is to care for a different covered servicemember
or to care for the same servicemember with a subsequent (different) serious
injury or illness.  However, no more than 26 workweeks of leave may be taken
within any single 12-month period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     A
subsequent serious injury or illness of the same covered servicemember could
arise either from a different injury or illness incurred by the current
sevicemember during a subsequent deployment or from a different injury or
illness that relates back to the initial incident but that manifests at a later
time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A.    For
example, an eligible employee may take leave in one 12-month period to care for
a servicemember who incurs a traumatic brain injury and take leave in a
subsequent 12-month period to care for the same servicemember who returns to
duty and is injured by an incendiary explosive device.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>B.    Additionally,
if a current covered servicemember suffers severe burns in the line of duty, an
eligible employee is entitled to 26 workweeks of military caregiver leave.  If
the servicemember later manifests post traumatic stress disorder that was
incurred in the same incident as the burns, the eligible employee would be
entitled to an additional 26 workweeks of leave to care for the same
servicemember.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     A
“current” covered servicemember and a “veteran” covered servicemember will be
considered different covered servicemembers for purposes of the 26 workweeks in
a single 12-month period requirement.  Therefore, an eligible employee could
take military caregiver leave to care for a current servicemember who suffered
a burn injury while in active duty service and later take leave to care for the
same servicemember for the same injury when the servicemember becomes a veteran. 
All normal eligibility requirements would apply when the employee seeks
military caregiver leave to care for the veteran.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.127(e),
825.200(b)</p>
<p>77 FR 8960, 8970</p>
<p>73 FR 67934, 67969</p>
<p>78 FR 8834</p>
<p>78 FR 8854</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     During
the single 12-month period the employee can take a combined total of 26
workweeks of leave, no more than 12 weeks of which can be for any combination
of FMLA-qualifying reasons other than military caregiver leave (i.e., leave for
the birth or placement of a child, leave due to the serious health condition of
the employee or the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent, or leave due
to a qualifying exigency arising from a military member’s covered active duty
status).  However, the employee’s entitlement to FMLA leave for reasons other
than military caregiver leave is limited by his or her prior use of FMLA leave
during the applicable 12-month period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     For
example, where an employee first takes military caregiver leave beginning June
1, 2013 and works for an employer who uses the calendar year for tracking FMLA
leave usage, the employee’s single 12-month period for military caregiver leave
is June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014.  If the employee had used five weeks of
FMLA leave between January 1 and June 1, 2013 for a qualifying reason other
than military caregiver leave, such as for his own serious health condition, he
would only have seven weeks of FMLA leave for a qualifying reason other than
military caregiver leave available through December 31, 2013.  Once the
employee exhausts his 26-workweek entitlement, he may not take any FMLA leave
for any reason until the single 12-month period ends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     Thus,
if the employee used 20 weeks of military caregiver leave from June-December,
2013, four weeks of leave in January, 2014 for his own serious health
condition, and another two weeks of military caregiver leave in March, 2014,
the employee will have exhausted his 26-workeek entitlement for the single
12-month period (June 1, 2013-May 31, 2014).  The employee would still have
eight weeks of FMLA leave for a qualifying reason other than military caregiver
leave available in calendar year 2014; however, he could not take this leave
until after the single 12-month period ends on May 31, 2014.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Qualifying
leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Leave that qualifies as both leave to care for
a covered servicemember and leave to care for a family member with a serious
health condition during the single 12-month period must be designated by the
employer as leave to care for a covered servicemember.  It cannot be designated
and counted as leave for both reasons.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Spouses employed by the same employer are
limited to a combined total of 26 workweeks of leave during the single 12-month
period if the leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember with a serious
injury or illness or for a combination of military caregiver leave and leave
for the birth of the employee’s son or daughter, placement of a son or daughter
with the employee for adoption of foster care, or to care for the employee’s
parent with a serious health condition.  See FOH 39e03.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Next of kin of
a covered servicemember</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The covered servicemember’s next of kin is the
servicemember’s nearest blood relative.  The next of kin is someone other than
the servicemember’s spouse, parent, son or daughter, and is determined in the
following order of priority:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     Designated
next of kin for purposes of military caregiver leave under the FMLA</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The covered
servicemember may specifically designate in writing his or her nearest blood
relative for purposes of military caregiver leave under the FMLA.  When such
designation has been made, the designated individual is deemed the covered
servicemember’s only next of kin.  The designated next of kin must be a blood
relative of the covered servicemember.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Order
of priority</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When a servicemember
does not make a designation for purposes of FMLA leave, the next of kin is determined
in the following order of priority:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     Blood
relatives who have been granted legal custody of the servicemember by court
decree or statutory provisions,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     Brothers
and sisters,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.     Grandparents,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.     Aunts
and uncles,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5.     First
cousins.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When there are
multiple family members with the same level of relationship and the covered
servicemember has not designated a next of kin for FMLA purposes, all such
family members are considered the next of kin and all may take leave to provide
care to the covered servicemember, either consecutively or simultaneously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, if a
covered servicemember has three siblings and has not designated a blood relative
to provide care for FMLA purposes, all three siblings would be considered the
covered servicemember’s next of kin.  Alternatively, where a covered
servicemember has one or more siblings and designates a cousin as his or her
next of kin for FMLA purposes, then only the designated cousin is eligible as
the covered servicemember’s next of kin.</p>

<h3>39e00 - FMLA leave entitlement.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   General</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An eligible employee
is entitled to up to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave per 12-month period for FMLA-qualifying
reasons other than military caregiver leave (see FOH 39d09).  Multiple
serious health conditions or qualifying reasons for leave do not increase the FMLA
leave entitlement.  However, an employee is entitled to up to 12 workweeks of leave
for any one or for multiple qualifying reasons in the same leave year and additional
leave for the same qualifying reason, including the same serious health condition,
in subsequent leave years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>See FOH 39d09(a)(3)
for the single 12-month period applicable to military caregiver leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   12-month
FMLA leave year for qualifying leave reasons other than military caregiver
leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employer
may select any one of the following methods for determining the 12-month period
during which the 12 workweeks of leave entitlement occur:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     The
calendar year</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Any
fixed 12-month leave year, such as a fiscal year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     A
12-month period measured forward from the first date of FMLA leave for the
employee.  The next 12-month period would begin the first time FMLA leave is
taken after completion of the prior 12-month period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.     A
rolling 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses FMLA
leave.  Under this method, each time an employee takes FMLA leave the remaining
leave would be the balance of the 12 weeks which has not been used during the
immediately preceding 12 months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     Example
1:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employee A used eight
weeks of FMLA leave during the past 12 months, employee A has an additional
four weeks of FMLA leave available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employee B used four
weeks of FMLA beginning February 1, 2011, four weeks beginning June 1, 2011,
and four weeks beginning December 1, 2011.  Employee B may not take any
additional leave FMLA leave until February 1, 2012.  Beginning on February 1,
2012, employee B is entitled to use one additional day of FMLA leave each day
for four weeks. Employee B also begins to regain additional days of FMLA leave
beginning on June 1, 2012, and additional days beginning on December 1, 2012.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Employers may
choose any method as long as it is applied uniformly and consistently to all
employees.  An exception to this uniformity applies in the case of a multi-state
employer who must comply with a state requirement for determination of the leave
year. In this case the employer may comply with the state requirement for
employees in that state and uniformly choose another method for all its other
employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  An employer may
change to another leave year determination only after providing 60 days notice
to all employees.  During the 60-day transition, employees retain full benefit
of their 12 workweeks of leave under whichever method provides the greatest
benefit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  If an employer
fails to select one of these methods for setting the 12-month period, the
employer must use the 12-month period calculation method that is most
beneficial to the employee.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>39e01 - Intermittent leave.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   General</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  FMLA leave may
be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule under the following
conditions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     When
there is a medical need for leave that can be best accommodated through an
intermittent or reduced leave schedule for an employee’s own serious health
condition, to care for a spouse, parent, son, or daughter with a serious health
condition, or to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or
illness.  Such leave may be necessary for planned and/or unanticipated medical
treatment of a serious health condition or of a serious injury or illness of a covered
servicemember, or during recovery from treatment.  It may also be taken to
provide care or psychological comfort to a spouse, parent, son, or daughter
with a serious health condition or a covered servicemember with a serious
injury or illness.  Examples of medically necessary intermittent leave include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     Leave
taken for a condition which requires treatment by a health care provider
periodically, rather than for one continuous period of time, and may include
leave of periods from an hour or more to several weeks,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     Leave
taken by a pregnant employee for prenatal examinations or for periods of severe
morning sickness,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.     Leave
taken for absences where a family member is incapacitated or the employee is unable
to perform the essential functions of the position intermittently because of a
chronic serious health condition, even if he or she does not receive treatment
from a health care provider.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     When
leave is taken due to a qualifying exigency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Intermittent
leave or a reduced leave schedule after the birth of a healthy child or
placement of a healthy child for adoption or foster care may only be taken if
the employer agrees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2612(b)(1)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.202</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Scheduling
of leave</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If an employee needs
leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule for planned medical
treatment, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment
so as not to disrupt unduly the employer’s operations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2612(e)(2)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.203</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Transfer
to an alternate position</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  If an employee
needs intermittent leave that is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment,
the employer may require the employee to transfer temporarily, during the
period that the intermittent or reduced leave schedule is required, to an
alternative position for which the employee is qualified and that better
accommodates recurring periods of leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  An employer
must provide equivalent pay and benefits in the alternative position, but the
position does not have to have equivalent duties.  The employer may increase
the pay and benefits of an existing alternative position to make them equivalent
to those of the employee’s regular job.  Where an employer’s normal practice
bases benefits on the number of hours worked, the employer may proportionately
reduce benefits for an employee’s reduced hours worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  An employer may
not transfer an employee to an alternative position in order to discourage the
employee from taking leave or otherwise work a hardship on the employee.  See
FOH 39o.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  When an
employee no longer needs to continue on intermittent or reduced schedule leave
and is able to return to full-time work, the employer must place the employee
in the same or equivalent job as the job the employee left when the leave
commenced.  The employee may not be required to take more leave than necessary
to address the circumstance that precipitated the need for leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  The FMLA limits
an employer’s ability to require that an employee transfer to an alternate
position to situations involving foreseeable leave for planned medical
treatment.  This is the only situation where an employer may require a
transfer.</p>

<p>29 CFR 825.204</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Increments
of leave</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employer
must account for intermittent leave or reduced schedule leave by no greater
than the shortest period of time used to account for other forms of leave,
provided it is not greater than one hour and does not reduce the employee’s
FMLA entitlement by more than the amount of leave actually taken.  For example,
if an employer accounts for the use of annual leave in increments of one hour
and the use of sick leave in increments of one-half hour, then FMLA leave use
must be accounted for using increments no larger than one-half hour.   If the
employer accounts for other forms of leave use in increments greater than one
hour during the period the FMLA leave is taken, the employer must account for
FMLA leave in increments no greater than one hour.   See FOH 39m02 for special
rules applicable to airline flight crew employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  If an employer
uses varying increments to account for leave usage at different times of the
day or shift, the employer may not account for FMLA leave in a larger increment
than the shortest period used to account for other leave during the period the
FMLA leave is taken.  For example, if an employer usually accounts for all
types of leave in increments of 15 minutes, but accounts for all non-FMLA leave
for the first hour of the day in 30-minute increments, the employer may also
account for FMLA leave in an increment no greater than 30 minutes only during
the first hour of the day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Where it is
physically impossible for an employee using intermittent leave or working a
reduced leave schedule to commence or end work mid-way through a shift, the
entire period that the employee is forced to be absent is designated as FMLA
leave and counts against the employee’s entitlement.  The “physical
impossibility” provision is intended to be narrowly construed and applied only
in instances of true physical impossibility.  Thus, if the exception applies to
a flight attendant, train conductor, ferry operator, bus driver, or truck
driver whose worksite is on board an airplane, train, boat, bus, or truck, or
to a laboratory technician whose workplace is inside a clean room that must
remain sealed for a certain period of time, the exception will only apply until
the vehicle has returned to the departure site or while the clean room remains
sealed.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Calculation
of leave</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employee’s
actual workweek is the basis for the FMLA entitlement.</p>
<p>a.     If
an employee is normally required to work more than 40 hours per week, the hours
worked beyond 40 must be included in determining the employee’s leave
entitlement.  For example, if an employee normally works overtime in three of
every four weeks, then such overtime hours are part of the usual and normal
workweek schedule of the employee and are included in calculating the FMLA
entitlement available to the employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     If
overtime hours are not required, or are voluntary, such hours are not counted
to calculate the employee’s FMLA entitlement and are not counted against the
employee’s FMLA entitlement when not worked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>73 FR 67934,
67978-67979</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The FMLA provides
eligible employees with up to 12 workweeks of leave for qualifying reasons and
up to 26 workweeks of leave for military caregiver leave.  When an employee
takes leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule in periods of less
than one full week, only the amount of leave actually taken may be counted
toward the employee’s leave entitlement.  An employer may convert fractions of
a workweek to their hourly equivalent so long as the conversion equitably
reflects the employee’s total hours.  For example, an employee whose actual
workweek is always 40 hours per week, is entitled to an hourly equivalent of
480 hours (12 workweeks × 40 hours per week).  For an employee whose schedule
varies from week to week, the hourly equivalent must equitably reflect the
actual hours that would be worked during each workweek that FMLA leave is
needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  If the
employee’s schedule varies from week to week to such an extent that the
employer is unable to determine how many hours the employee would have worked
had he or she not taken FMLA leave, the employer may use a weekly average of
the hours scheduled over the 12 months prior to the period of leave for
calculating the employee’s leave entitlement.</p>

<h3>39e02 - Substitution of accrued
paid leave.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   General</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An eligible employee
may choose, or the employer may require the employee, to substitute accrued
paid leave for FMLA leave.  Substitute means that the paid leave provided by
the employer will run concurrently with the unpaid FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Accrued
paid leave</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the purpose of
substituting accrued paid leave, the employee must have both earned the leave
and be able to use that leave during the FMLA leave period.  The employer may
not require the employee to substitute leave that is not yet available to the
employee to use under the terms of the employer's leave plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This, however, would
neither prevent an employer from voluntarily advancing paid leave to an
employee nor an employee from voluntarily accepting such leave during an FMLA
absence.</p>

<p>WHD Non-Administrator
Letter FMLA-61 May 12, 1995</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Adherence
to employer’s leave policy</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When accrued paid
leave is substituted, the employee receives pay pursuant to the employer’s
applicable paid leave policy during the otherwise unpaid FMLA leave.  An
employee’s ability to substitute accrued paid leave is determined by the terms
and conditions of the employer’s normal leave policy.  For example, pursuant to
an employer’s uniform policy for all employees, an employer may request a
doctor’s note in order for the employee to receive paid sick leave.  The
employer must inform the employee that he or she must satisfy any procedural
requirements of the paid leave policy to receive payment for the substituted
leave.  If the employee does not comply with the additional requirements of the
employer’s paid leave policy, the employee is no longer entitled to substitute
accrued paid leave, but remains entitled to take unpaid FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Concurrent
use of FMLA and other paid leaves</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Leave taken
pursuant to a disability leave plan, which also meets the definition of a
serious health condition under the FMLA, may be counted against the employee’s
FMLA leave entitlement.  A serious health condition may result from an injury
on or off the job and leave for an injury meeting the FMLA criteria may be
designated by the employer as FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Because leave
under a disability benefit plan or workers’ compensation program is not unpaid,
the provision for substitution of accrued paid leave does not apply, and
neither the employee nor the employer may require the substitution of paid
leave.  However, employers and employees may agree, where state law permits, to
have accrued paid leave supplement the paid plan benefits, such as in a case
where a plan only provides two-thirds of an employee’s salary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Section 7(o) of
the FLSA permits public employers, under certain conditions, to substitute
compensatory time off at one and one-half hours for each overtime hour worked
in lieu of paying cash to employees who work overtime.  If an employee requests
and is permitted to use accrued compensatory time concurrently with FMLA leave,
or the employer requires its use, the time may be counted against the
employee’s FMLA entitlement.</p>

<h3>39e03 - Spouses employed by same
employer.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Spouses
employed by the same employer are limited to a combined total of 12 workweeks
for the birth or placement of a healthy child, care for a healthy child after
birth or placement, or to care for a parent with a serious health condition. 
The limitation would apply even if the spouses are employed at locations more
than 75 miles apart but would not apply if one of the spouses was ineligible
for FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Spouses
are entitled to 12 workweeks each for their own serious health condition or to
care for a spouse, son, or daughter with a serious health condition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Where a
spouse uses a portion of his or her leave for a purpose that is subject to the
combined 12-week limit, that employee has the remainder of his or her 12
workweeks for any leave that is not subject to the combined limit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Spouses
employed by the same employer may also be limited to a combined total of 26
workweeks of leave for the care of a covered servicemember with a serious
injury or illness.</p>

<h3>39e04 - Effects on an employee’s
salary.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employee
exempt under 29 CFR 541 (salary basis test)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employee exempt
from minimum wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA as a salaried
executive, administrative, professional, or computer employee does not lose the
FLSA exemption by receiving unpaid FMLA leave.  The employer may make
deductions from the employee’s salary for any hours taken as intermittent or
reduced FMLA leave within a workweek without affecting the exempt status of the
employee.  See 29 CFR 541.602(b)(7).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2612(c)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Employee
paid under 29 CFR 778.114 (fluctuating workweek)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  For an employee
paid in accordance with the fluctuating workweek method of payment for
overtime, the employer, during the period in which intermittent or reduced
schedule FMLA leave is scheduled to be taken, may compensate the employee on an
hourly basis and pay only for the hours the employees works, including time and
one-half the employee’s regular rate for overtime hours.  The change to payment
on an hourly basis must include the entire period during which the employee is
taking intermittent leave, including weeks in which no leave is taken.  The
employer must use this practice uniformly with respect to all employees paid in
this manner who take FMLA leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  If an employer
does not elect to convert the employee’s compensation to hourly pay, no
deduction may be taken for FMLA leave absences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.206</p>

<h3>39f00 - General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When an employee
seeks leave for the first time for a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employee does
not have to expressly assert rights under the FMLA or even mention the FMLA. 
When an employee seeks leave due to a FMLA-qualifying reason for which he or
she has previously taken leave, the employee must specifically reference the
qualifying reason for leave or the need for FMLA leave.  This requirement applies
to both foreseeable and unforeseeable leave requests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employee has an
obligation to respond to an employer’s questions designed to determine whether
an absence is potentially FMLA-qualifying.  Failure to respond to reasonable
inquiries may result in denial of FMLA protection if the employer is unable to
determine whether the leave is FMLA-qualifying.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.302 - 825.303</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39f01 - Notice of foreseeable leave.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Timing of
notice</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  An employee
must provide the employer at least 30 days advance notice before FMLA leave is
to begin if the need for leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth,
placement for adoption or foster care, planned medical treatment for a serious
health condition, or planned treatment for a serious injury or illness of a
covered servicemember.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  If 30 days
notice is not practicable, such as because of a lack of knowledge of approximately
when the leave will be required to begin, a change in circumstances, or a
medical emergency, notice must be given as soon as possible and practical
taking into account all of the circumstances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Whether FMLA
leave is to be continuous or intermittent, notice need only be given one time,
but the employee must advise the employer as soon as practicable if the dates
of scheduled leave change or are extended, or were initially unknown.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  If the need for
leave was foreseeable based on an expected birth or placement for adoption or
foster care, for planned medical treatment of a serious health condition of the
employee or family member or a serious injury or illness of a covered
servicemember, and the employee fails to provide 30 days advance notice, the
employee may be required, at the employer’s request, to explain why such notice
was not practicable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  For foreseeable
leave due to a qualifying exigency, an employee must provide notice as soon as
practicable, regardless of how far in advance such leave is foreseeable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2612(e)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.302(a)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Content
of notice</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employee must
provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the employer aware that the
employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave and the anticipated timing and duration of
the leave.  In all cases the employer is expected to inquire further if it is
necessary to obtain more information about whether the employee is seeking
FMLA-protected leave.  When the employee has taken leave previously for more
than one FMLA-qualifying reason, the employer may need to ask additional
questions to determine for which qualifying reason the employee is seeking FMLA
leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.302(c)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Complying
with employer policies</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The employer may
require the employee to comply with the employer’s usual and customary notice
and procedural requirements for requesting leave absent unusual circumstances. 
If the employee does not comply with the employer’s usual and customary policy
and procedures and no unusual circumstances exist, the FMLA-protected leave may
be delayed or denied.  However, if the employer’s policy requires notice to be
provided sooner than required under the FMLA and the employee does not comply
with the employer’s policy, FMLA-protected leave may not be delayed or denied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.302(d)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Scheduling
planned medical treatment</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The employee must
make a reasonable effort to schedule planned medical treatment so as not to
unduly disrupt the employer’s operations.  An employee should consult with his
or her employer prior to scheduling treatment in order to work out a schedule
that best suits the employee’s and employer’s needs.<br />

<h3>39f02 - Notice of unforeseeable
leave</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Timing of
notice</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the approximate
timing of the need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must provide
notice to the employer as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances
of the particular case.  It generally should be possible and practical within
the time prescribed by the employer’s usual and customary notice requirements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.303(a)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Content
of notice</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employee must
provide sufficient information for an employer to reasonably determine whether
the FMLA may apply to the leave request.  Calling in “sick” without providing
more information is not considered sufficient notice to trigger an employer’s
obligations under the FMLA.  The employer is expected to obtain additional
information through informal means.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.303(b)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Complying
with employer policies</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the need for
leave is not foreseeable, the employee must still comply with the employer’s
usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for taking leave unless
there are unusual circumstances.  For example, an employee would not be
required to follow an employer’s procedural requirement to call-in prior to the
start of his or her shift if a medical emergency requiring FMLA leave prevented
the employee from doing so.  If the employee does not comply with the
employer’s usual and customary policies for requesting unforeseeable leave and
no unusual circumstances exist, FMLA leave may be delayed or denied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.302(c)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39f03 - Failure to comply with FMLA
notification policies.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If an employee has
been provided notice of the FMLA notice requirements and fails to comply with
those requirements, his or her FMLA coverage may be delayed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   If an
employee knows of the need for leave and the approximate date the leave would
be taken 30 days in advance of the leave but fails to give notice of the need
for leave with no reasonable excuse, the employer may delay FMLA coverage until
30 days after the date the employee provides notice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   If the
employee knows of the need for leave fewer than 30 days in advance but fails to
give notice of the need for leave as soon as practicable under the
circumstances, the extent to which the employer may delay leave depends on the
facts of the particular case.  For example, if an employee reasonably should
have given the employer two weeks notice but instead only provided one week
notice, then the employer may delay FMLA-protected leave for one week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   If the
need for leave is unforeseen, the extent to which the employer may delay leave
depends on the circumstances.  For example, if it was practicable for the
employee to provide notice very soon after the need for leave arises but the
employee does not provide notice until two days after the leave began, then the
employer may delay FMLA coverage of the leave by two days.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>(a)   General
notice</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  FMLA poster</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     All
covered employers, including those with no eligible employees, are required to
keep posted a notice explaining the provisions of the FMLA and providing
information concerning the procedures for filing complaints of FMLA violations
with the Wage and Hour Division.  The poster and text must be large enough to
be easily read and be prominently posted where it may readily be seen by
employees and applicants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Electronic
posting is sufficient provided it meets all other requirements.  Electronic
posting does not excuse the employer from the statutory requirement to post in
a location viewable by applicants for employment.  Therefore, if the employer
posts such information on an intranet that is not accessible to applicants,
additional posting would be necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>73 FR 67934, 67991</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     If
a significant portion of the employer’s workforce is not literate in English,
the employer must provide the general notice in a language in which employees
are literate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Additional
distribution of general notice</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a covered employer has any eligible
employees, it must also provide this general notice to each employee.  If the
employer has an employee handbook or other written guidance to employees
concerning benefits or leave rights, the FMLA general notice must also be
included therein.  If the employer does not have such written materials, the
employer must distribute a copy of the FMLA general notice to each new employee
upon hiring.  In either case, distribution may be accomplished electronically. 
The employer must translate the notice if a significant portion of workers are
not literate in English into a language in which the employees are literate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.300(a)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Eligibility
notice</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  When an
employee requests FMLA leave, or when the employer acquires knowledge that an
employee’s leave may be for an FMLA-qualifying reason, the employer must notify
the employee of the employee’s eligibility to take FMLA leave within 5 business
days, absent extenuating circumstances.  The notice must state whether the
employee is eligible for FMLA leave, and if not, at least one reason why the employee
is not eligible.  See FOH 39c for determining employee eligibility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The eligibility
notice must be provided to the employee following the first request for FMLA leave
in each 12-month leave year and only for subsequent requests for FMLA leave for
a different qualifying reason within the same 12-month leave year if the
employee’s eligibility status has changed from the first notice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Notice may be
oral or in writing; employers may use optional form WH-381 to provide the eligibility
notice.  The employer must translate the notice if a significant portion of
workers are not literate in English into a language in which the employees are
literate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.300(b)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Rights
and responsibilities notice</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Employers must
provide written notice detailing the specific expectations and obligations of
the employee and explaining any consequences of a failure to meet these
obligations.  This notice must be provided to the employee each time the
eligibility notice is provided.  If the employee’s leave has already begun, the
notice must be mailed to the employee’s address of record.  See FOH 39g00(b).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The notice must
include, as appropriate, the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     That
the leave may be designated and counted against the employee’s FMLA entitlement,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Any
requirements for the employee to furnish certification and the consequences of
failing to do so,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     The
employee’s right to substitute paid leave, whether the employer will require
the substitution of paid leave, the conditions related to substitution, and the
employee’s entitlement to take unpaid FMLA leave if the employee does not meet
the conditions for paid leave,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.     Any
requirement for the employee to make any premium payments to maintain health
benefits, the arrangements for making such payments, and the consequences for
failure to make timely payments,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.     The
employee’s status as a “key employee,” the potential consequence that
restoration may be denied following FMLA leave, and explanation of the
conditions required for denial of restoration,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>f.      The
employee’s rights to maintenance of benefits during the FMLA leave and
restoration upon return from FMLA leave, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>g.     The
employee’s potential liability for payment of health insurance premiums paid by
the employer during the employee’s unpaid FMLA leave if the employee fails to
return to work after taking FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The notice may
include additional information or be accompanied by a certification form but is
not required to do so.  Employers may use optional use form WH-381 and may
adapt it as appropriate to meet the notice requirements.  Electronic
distribution is permitted so long as it otherwise meets the requirements. The
employer must translate the notice if a significant portion of workers are not
literate in English into a language in which the employees are literate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  If any of the
information in the notice changes, the employer must provide written notice
referencing the prior notice and providing the changes to an employee within five
business days of receipt of the employee’s first notice of need for leave
subsequent to any change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Employers are
expected to be responsive in answering questions from employees concerning
their rights and responsibilities under the FMLA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.300(c)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Designation
notice</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  When the
employer has enough information to determine whether leave is being taken for an
FMLA-qualifying reason, the employer must notify the employee of that
designation in writing within five business days, absent extenuating circumstances. 
If the employer requires paid leave to be substituted for unpaid FMLA leave,
the employer must inform the employee of this designation at the time of
designating the FMLA leave.  If the employer will require a fitness-for-duty
certification for restoration to employment, notice of this requirement must be
provided with the designation notice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The employer
must notify the employee of the amount of leave counted against the employee’s
FMLA leave entitlement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     If
the amount of leave needed is known at the time of designation, the employer
must notify the employee of the number of hours, days, or weeks that will be
counted against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement in the designation
notice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     If
it is not possible to provide the exact time that will be counted, such may be
the case with unforeseeable intermittent leave, then upon request by the
employee, the employer must provide notice of the amount of leave counted
against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement, but no more often than once in a
30-day period and only if leave is taken in that period.  This notice may be
oral or in writing, but if given orally, must be confirmed in writing no later
than the next payday, and can be in any form, including a note on the
employee’s pay stub.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Only one notice
of designation is required for each FMLA-qualifying reason per applicable
12-month period.  The employer may use the optional form WH-382.  If the leave
is not designated as FMLA because it does not meet the requirements, the notice
to the employee that the leave is not designated as FMLA leave may be a simple
written statement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  If the
information provided in the notice changes, the employer must provide written
notice of the change within five business days of receiving the employee’s
first notice of need for leave after the change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.300(d)</p>
<p>  </p>

<h3>39g01 - Designation of FMLA leave.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The
employer is responsible in all circumstances for designating leave as
FMLA-qualifying once the employer has knowledge that the leave is being taken
for an FMLA-qualifying reason.  In any circumstance where the employer does not
have sufficient information about the employee’s reason for leave, the employer
should inquire further of the employee to determine whether leave is
potentially FMLA-qualifying.  The employer’s determination on whether leave is
FMLA-qualifying must be based only on information received from the employee or
the employee’s spokesperson.  Once the employer has acquired knowledge that the
leave is being taken for a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employer must notify the
employee.  See FOH 39g00(d).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Retroactive
designation</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the employer fails
to designate leave timely (i.e., within five business days absent unusual
circumstances), the employer may retroactively designate leave as FMLA leave
with appropriate notice to the employee provided that the employer’s failure to
timely designate leave does not cause harm or injury to the employee.  In all
cases where leave would qualify for FMLA protections, an employer and an
employee can mutually agree that leave be retroactively designated as FMLA
leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Disputes</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If there is a dispute
between an employer and an employee as to whether leave qualifies as FMLA
leave, it should be resolved through discussions between the employee and the
employer.  Such discussions and the decision must be documented.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.301</p>

<h3>39h00 - General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Valid
reasons for requesting certification</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Employers may
require employees seeking leave to care for a covered family member with a
serious health condition or for their own serious health condition to support
the request with a certification issued by the health care provider of the
family member or the employee, respectively, and subsequent recertification, as
appropriate.  In certain circumstances, an employer may also require a
fitness-for-duty certification for restoration to employment when the leave is
for the employee’s own serious health condition.  See FOH 39h01 for medical
certification for a serious health condition and 39h02 for fitness for duty
certification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  An employer may
also require that an employee’s leave due to a qualifying exigency or to care
for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness be supported by a
certification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>See FOH 39h06 and 39h07 for certification
requirements for military family leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  An employer may
not request certification of leave to care for a healthy newborn child, or for
placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care,
although the employer may request documentation of the family relationship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>See FOH 39h05.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Notice to
employee of certification requirement</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  An employer
must give notice to the employee each time a certification is required. When
required for the rights and responsibilities notice, the notification must be
written. Requests for subsequent certification may be oral.  When requesting a
certification, the employer must advise an employee of the consequences of an
employee’s failure to provide adequate certification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  In most cases,
the employer should request that an employee furnish certification at the time
the employee gives notice of the need for leave or within five business days. 
The employer may request certification at some later date if the employer later
has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Employee
certification responsibilities</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employee
must provide the requested certification to the employer within 15 calendar
days after the employer’s request, unless it is not practicable under the
particular circumstances to do so despite the employee’s diligent, good faith
efforts, or the employer provides more than 15 calendar days to return the
requested certification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The employee
must provide the employer with a complete and sufficient certification.  It is
the employee’s responsibility to furnish a complete and sufficient
certification or to furnish the health care provider providing the
certification with any necessary authorization from the employee or family
member in order for the health care provider to release a complete and
sufficient certification to the employer to support the employee’s FMLA
request.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Deficient
certification and opportunity to cure</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employer
must advise an employee whenever the employer finds any certification,
including medical certification of a serious health condition or serious injury
or illness of covered servicemember or certification of a qualifying exigency,
incomplete or insufficient, and must state in writing what additional
information is necessary to make the certification complete and sufficient. 
The employer must provide the employee with seven calendar days to correct any
deficiency, unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances for
the employee to cure any identified deficiency in the seven-day period despite
the employee’s diligent good faith efforts.  If the deficiencies specified by
the employer are not cured in the resubmitted certification, the employer may
deny the taking of FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  A certification
is considered incomplete if one or more applicable entries have not been
completed.  A certification is considered insufficient if the information
provided is vague, ambiguous, or non-responsive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Consequences
of employee’s failure to provide certification</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is the employer’s
responsibility to advise the employee of the consequences of failure to provide
adequate certification.  When an employee is unable to meet the 15-calendar day
deadline to submit a certification despite the employee’s diligent good faith
efforts, the employee is entitled to additional time to provide the
certification.  Employees are expected to communicate to their employers the
efforts they are making to secure the completed certification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the employee fails
to provide the employer with a timely complete and sufficient certification,
absent extenuating circumstances, or fails to provide any certification, the
employer may delay or deny the taking of FMLA leave.  See FOH 39h03.</p>

<h3>39h01 - Medical certification of a
serious health condition.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When leave is taken
because of an employee’s own serious health condition or the serious health
condition of a family member, an employer may require the employee to obtain a
medical certification at the employee’s expense.  See FOH 39h06 for
certification of qualifying exigency leave and 39h07 for certification of
military caregiver leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Sufficient
medical certification</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The FMLA
provides that a medical certification is sufficient if it states:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     The
date the serious health condition commenced and probable duration of the
condition;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     The
contact information of the health care provider and type of
practice/specialization;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     The
appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider
regarding the condition sufficient to support the need for leave;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.     For
leave to care for a family member, a statement that the employee is needed to
care for the family member and an estimate of the amount of time needed; or for
leave for the employee’s own serious health condition, a statement that the
employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the position and the
likely duration of such inability; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.     For
intermittent or reduced schedule leave, the certification must also include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     For
planned medical treatment of the employee’s or the employee’s family member’s
serious health condition, a statement of the medical necessity for intermittent
or reduced leave schedule and the dates treatment is expected and duration of
such treatment,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     For
unforeseeable leave for the employee’s own serious health condition (including
pregnancy) that causes unforeseen periods of incapacity, a statement of the
medical necessity for intermittent or reduced leave schedule and an estimation
of the frequency and duration of such periods of incapacity, and,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.     For
unforeseeable leave for a family member’s serious health condition, a statement
that the leave schedule is medically necessary for the care of the family
member, which can include assisting in the family member’s recovery, and an
estimate of the frequency and duration of the intermittent or reduced schedule
leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2613(b)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.306(a)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Medical facts</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The medical facts appropriate for inclusion on
the certification form will vary depending on the nature of the serious health
condition and are to be determined by the health care provider but must be
sufficient to support the need for leave.  For example, at the health care
provider’s discretion, the medical facts may include information on symptoms,
doctor’s visits, or a diagnosis.  Whether a diagnosis is included in the
certification form is left to the discretion of the health care provider and an
employer may not reject a complete and sufficient certification because it
lacks a diagnosis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>73 FR 67934, 68014</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Frequency and
duration of the condition</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not all absences caused by certain serious
health conditions are predictable.  Health care providers are expected to
provide only their best informed medical judgment when estimating the need for
unforeseeable intermittent leave. The FMLA does not permit an employer to
require an exact schedule of leave for such instances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>73 FR 67934, 68017</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Medical
certification forms</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  An employer
may, but is not required to, use the DOL’s two optional forms—Form WH-380-E and
Form WH-380-F—for use in obtaining medical certification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Employers may
develop their own forms but may not request any additional information beyond
that specified by the regulations.  An employer may not reject a medical
certification that otherwise contains the information required by the
regulations due to the form of the certification provided.  In all instances,
the certification must relate only to the condition for which leave is needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.306(b)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Annual
medical certification</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where leave for a
serious health condition lasts beyond a single leave year, a new medical
certification may be required in each subsequent FMLA leave year.  The employer
may request a medical certification with the first absence in a new 12-month
leave year.  The employer may seek authentication and clarification and second
and third opinions for these new medical certifications.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 C.F.R. 825.305(e)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Authentication
and clarification of a medical certification</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employer
may contact the health care provider for purposes of clarification and
authentication of the medical certification after the employer has given the
employee an opportunity to cure any deficiencies.  Employers may not ask for
additional information beyond that required by the certification form.  To make
such contact, the employer must use a health care provider, a human resources
professional, a leave administrator, or a management official.  Under no
circumstances may the employee’s direct supervisor contact the employee’s
health care provider.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Authentication
means providing the health care provider with a copy of the certification and
requesting verification that the information contained on the certification
form was completed and/or authorized by the health care provider who signed the
document.  No additional information may be requested.  Clarification means
contacting the health care provider to understand the handwriting on the
medical certification or to understand the meaning of a response.  No
additional information may be requested.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
Privacy Rule govern the privacy of individually-identifiable health information
created or held by HIPAA-covered entities.  Therefore, HIPAA requirements must
be satisfied when an employee’s or an employee’s family member’s
individually-identifiable health information is shared with an employer by a
HIPAA-covered entity.  HIPAA requires, among other things, a written
authorization by the employee (or the employee’s family member) in order to
release information for authentication and clarification purposes.  If an
employee does not provide such authorization to the health care provider
allowing the employer to obtain clarification of an unclear certification, and
does not otherwise clarify the certification, the employer may deny the FMLA
leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>73 FR 67934, 68018—68019</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.307(a)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Second
and third medical opinions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  An employer who
has reason to doubt the validity of a medical certification may request a second
opinion at the employer’s expense.  The employer is permitted to designate the
health care provider for the second opinion as long as the provider is not
employed on a regular basis by the employer, is not under contract with the
employer, or is not regularly utilized by the employer.  An exception can be
made if the employee is located in an area where access to health care is
extremely limited, such as a rural area where there may be only one or two
doctors in a relevant specialty.  The designated health care provider must be
within normal commuting distance, except in very unusual circumstances, and the
employer must reimburse the employee for reasonable travel expenses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Pending receipt
of the additional medical opinion, the employee is provisionally entitled to
FMLA benefits, including maintenance of group health benefits.  If the
certifications do not ultimately establish the employee’s entitlement to FMLA
leave, the leave cannot be designated as FMLA leave and may be treated as paid
or unpaid leave under the employer’s established leave policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  If the first
and second opinions differ, a third and binding opinion may be required at the
employer’s expense.  The third health care provider must be approved jointly by
the employer and the employee.  The employer and the employee must each act in
good faith to reach agreement on the third opinion provider.  If the employer
does not act in good faith, the employer will be bound by the first medical
certification.  If the employee does not act in good faith, the employee will
be bound by the second medical certification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Upon request by
the employee, the employer must provide copies of second or third opinions
within five business days absent extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  If a second or
third opinion health care provider requests relevant medical information from
an employee’s (or his or her family member’s) health care provider, and the
employee (or his or her family member) does not authorize his or her health
care provider to release relevant medical information, the employer may deny
the FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2613(c) and (d)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.307(b) - (e)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Medical
certification abroad</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In circumstances in
which the employee or family member is visiting another country, or a family
member resides in another country, and a serious health condition develops, employers
must accept medical certifications, including second and third opinions, from a
health care provider who practices in that country.  If a certification by a
foreign health care provider is not in English, the employee must provide a
written translation at the employer’s request.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.307(f)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Recertification</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  An employer may
request a recertification for leave taken because of an employee’s own serious
health condition or the serious health condition of a family member. 
Generally, an employer may ask for recertification no more frequently than
every 30 days and only in connection with an absence by the employee.  However,
if the minimum duration indicated on the medical certification exceeds 30 days,
an employer must wait the indicated minimum duration before requesting a
recertification (unless the exception in (g)(5) below applies).  In all cases,
however, an employer may request a recertification of a medical condition every
six months in connection with an absence by the employee.  This could apply
when, for example, the health care provider indicates a condition will last “a
lifetime”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The employer
may ask for the same information as permitted for the initial medical
certification.  In addition, the employer may provide a record of the employee’s
absence pattern to the health care provider and ask if the serious health
condition and need for leave is consistent with such pattern.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The employer
must allow at least 15 calendar days for the employee to provide the requested
recertification, unless it is not practicable under the particular
circumstances despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The employer
may contact the health care provider to authenticate or clarify the
recertification.  No second or third opinions may be required on a
recertification.  The recertification is at the employee’s expense.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Less than 30
days exception</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer may request recertification in less
than 30 days if:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     The
employee requests an extension of leave, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Circumstances
described by the previous certification have changed significantly (for
example, if the certification stated the employee needed leave for one to two
days for a particular serious health condition and the employee’s absences for that
condition lasted four days each the last two times leave was needed, the
increased duration might constitute a significant change), or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     The
employer receives information that casts doubt upon the employee’s stated
reason for the absence or the continuing validity of the certification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  When
recertification is not permitted</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Recertification does not apply to leave taken
for a qualifying exigency or to care for a covered servicemember with a serious
injury or illness (military caregiver leave).</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>39h02 - Fitness-for-duty
certification.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An
employer may have a uniformly-applied policy or practice that requires all
similarly-situated employees who take leave for their own serious health
condition to obtain and present certification from the employee’s health care
provider that the employee is able to resume work as a condition of restoring
an employee.  The fitness-for-duty certification can only be requested for the
health condition that caused the employee’s need for FMLA leave.  The employee
has the same obligation to participate and cooperate as in the medical
certification process.  The cost of the fitness-for-duty certification is borne
by the employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   During
intermittent or reduced schedule leave</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  When the
employee is on intermittent or reduced schedule leave, the employer is only entitled
to a certification of fitness to return to duty up to once every 30 days and
only if reasonable safety concerns exist regarding the employee’s ability to
perform his or her duties based on the serious health condition for which the
employee took FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Reasonable
safety concerns means a reasonable belief of significant risk of harm to the
employee or others.  In determining the reasonableness of safety concerns, an
employer should consider the nature and severity of the potential harm and the
likelihood that potential harm will occur.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Notice to
employee</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the employer will
require the employee to present a fitness-for-duty certification to be restored
to employment, the employer must provide notice of such requirement with the
designation notice.  An employer may require that the certification
specifically address the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions
of the employee’s job.  In such case, the employer must indicate that in the
designation notice and include a list of the essential functions of the
employee’s position.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Authentication
and/or clarification, and second and third opinions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer may contact
the employee’s health care provider for authentication and/or clarification of a
fitness-for-duty certification, but may not delay reinstatement of the employee
during the authentication or clarification period.  Second and third opinions
may not be required on fitness-for-duty certifications.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   State or
local law, collective bargaining agreement</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In all cases, if state
or local law or the terms of a collective bargaining agreement govern an
employee’s return to work, those provisions shall be applied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2614(a)(4)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.312</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39h03 - Employee failure to provide
certification.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Medical
certification</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  If an employee
fails to provide certification in a timely manner for foreseeable leave, an
employer may deny FMLA coverage for the leave until the required certification
is provided. For example, if an employee is given 15 days to provide
certification and does not provide certification for 45 days without sufficient
reason for the delay, the employer may deny FMLA protections for the period
following expiration of the 15-day time period, i.e., from day 16 through day
45.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  In the case of
unforeseeable leave, an employer may deny FMLA coverage for the requested leave
if the employee fails to provide a certification within 15 calendar days from
receipt of the request for certification unless not practicable due to
extenuating circumstances.  If the employee fails to timely return the
certification, the employer can deny FMLA protections for the leave following
the expiration of the 15-day time period until a sufficient certification is
provided.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  If the employee
never produces the certification, the leave is not FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Recertification</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If an employee fails
to provide a recertification within the time requested by the employer (which
must be at least 15 calendar days) or as soon as practicable under the
circumstances, then the employer may deny continuation of the FMLA leave
protections until the employee produces a sufficient recertification.  If the
employee never produces the recertification, the leave is not FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Fitness-for-duty
certification</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer may delay
employment restoration until an employee submits a required fitness-for-duty
certification unless the employer has failed to provide the proper
notification.  If the employee never submits the fitness-for-duty certification
or a new medical certification, the employee may be terminated.</p>

<h3>39h04 - Health care provider.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Within
the United States</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Medical certification
must be issued by a health care provider.  A “health care provider,” for
purposes of the FMLA, is a provider who is one of the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  A doctor of
medicine or osteopathy authorized to practice medicine or surgery by the State
in which the doctor practices,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  A podiatrist,
dentist, clinical psychologist, optometrist, or chiropractor authorized to
practice in the State and performing within the scope of his or her practice,
meaning authorized to diagnose and treat physical or mental health conditions (treatment
by a chiropractor is limited to treatment consisting of manual manipulation of
the spine to correct a subluxation as demonstrated by X-ray to exist),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  A nurse
practitioner, nurse-midwife, clinical social worker, or physician assistant
authorized to practice in the State and performing within the scope of his or
her practice, meaning authorized to diagnose and treat physical or mental
health conditions,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  A Christian
Science Practitioner listed with the First Church of Christ, Scientist in
Boston, Massachusetts, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Any health care
provider from whom the employer or the employer’s group health plan’s benefits
manager will accept a medical certification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Outside
the United States</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A “health care
provider” includes a health care provider listed above who practices in a
country other than the United States, who is authorized to practice in
accordance with the law of that country, and who is performing within the scope
of his or her practice as defined under such law.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>39h05 - Documentation of
relationship.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>For purposes of
confirmation of family relationship, the employer may require the employee
giving notice of the need for leave to provide reasonable documentation or
statement of family relationship.  This documentation may take the form of a
simple statement from the employee, or a child’s birth certificate, a court
document, etc.  The employer is entitled to examine the documentation but the
employee is entitled to the return of the document.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>39h06 - Certification for
qualifying exigency leave.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Active
duty orders</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first time an
employee requests leave for a qualifying exigency, the employer may require the
employee to provide a copy of the military member’s active duty orders or other
military documentation which indicates the covered active duty or call to
active duty and dates of such service.  Official military correspondence, such
as a letter from a superior officer in the military member’s chain of command,
will be sufficient to establish that the military member is on covered active
duty or under a call to covered active duty. The military member’s active duty
orders or other military documentation need only be provided to the employer
once.  An employer may subsequently require an employee to provide a copy of
new active duty order or other military documentation only for a qualifying
exigency request arising out of a different period of covered active duty of
the same military member or the covered active duty of a different military
member.</p>

<p>78 FR 8854 – 8855</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Additional
certification</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer may
require that leave for any qualifying exigency be supported by a certification
that provides the dates, description, and other details of the exigency and the
needed leave.  An employer may request the following information for qualifying
exigency certification:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  A statement or
description, signed by the employee, of appropriate facts regarding the
qualifying exigency, including information on the type of qualifying exigency
for which leave is requested, and, if available, any written documentation that
supports the need for leave,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The approximate
date on which the qualifying exigency commenced or will commence,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The beginning
and ending dates for leave taken for a single, continuous period of time,</p>

information for the individual or entity with whom the employee plans to meet (e.g.,
name, title, organization, address, telephone number, fax number, and email
address) and a brief description of the purpose of the meeting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer may use

<p>If the qualifying
exigency leave is to spend time with the military member while he or she is on
Rest and Recuperation leave, an employer may request a copy of the member’s
Rest and Recuperation orders or other documentation issued by the military
which states the military member had been granted Rest and Recuperation leave and
the dates.  See FOH 39d08(b)(6).</p>

additional information.  If the exigency involves meeting with a third party,
the employer may contact the individual or entity only to verify the purpose
and schedule of the meeting.  An employer may also contact an appropriate unit
of the Department of Defense only to request verification that a military
member is on covered active or call to covered active duty status.  The
employer does not need the employee’s permission for verification.</p>

<h3>39h07 - Certification for military
caregiver leave.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An
employer may require an employee to obtain a certification from an authorized
health care provider when leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember
with a serious injury or illness. The certification may be completed by:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  A Department of
Defense (DOD) health care provider,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  A Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) health care provider,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  A DOD TRICARE
network authorized private health care provider,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  A DOD
non-network TIRCARE authorized private health care provider, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  A health care
provider as defined in 29 CFR 825.125.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The authorized health
care provider may rely on determinations from an authorized DOD or VA
representative for certain military-related determinations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   An
employer may request the following information for military caregiver leave
certification:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The name,
address, and appropriate contact information (telephone number, fax     number,
and/or email address) of the health care provider, the type of medical
practice, the medical specialty, and whether the health care provider is one of
the health care providers specified in FOH 39h07(a),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Whether the
covered servicemember’s injury or illness was incurred in the line of duty
while on active duty or, if not, whether the covered servicemember’s injury or
illness existed before the beginning of the servicemember’s active duty and was
aggravated by service in the line of duty while on active duty,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The approximate
date on which the serious injury or illness commenced, or was aggravated, and
its probable duration,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  A statement of
appropriate medical facts regarding the covered servicemember’s health
condition, sufficient to support the need for leave,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     Current
member of the Armed Forces</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a current member
of the Armed Forces, such medical facts must include information on whether the
injury or illness may render the covered servicemember medically unfit to
perform the duties of the servicemember’s office, grade, rank, or rating and
whether the member is receiving medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Veteran</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a covered
veteran, such medical facts must include information on whether the veteran is
receiving medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for an injury or illness
that:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     Is
the continuation of a serious injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated
when the covered veteran was a member of the Armed Forces and that rendered the
member medically unfit to perform the duties of the member’s office, grade,
rank, or rating, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     Is
a physical or mental condition for which the covered veteran has received a VA
Service-Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50 percent or greater.  The VASRD
rating must be based, in whole or in part, on the condition for which the need
for military caregiver leave is requested, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.     Is
a physical or mental condition that substantially impairs the covered veteran’s
ability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of a
disability or disabilities related to military service, or would do so absent
treatment, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.     Is
substantiated by documentation of enrollment in the Department of Veterans
Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Information
sufficient to establish that the covered servicemember is in need of care, as
described in 29 CFR 825.124, and whether the covered servicemember will need
care for a single continuous period of time, including any time for treatment
and recovery, and an estimate as to the beginning and ending dates for this
period of time,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(6)  If an employee
requests leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis for planned medical
treatment appointments for the covered servicemember, whether there is a
medical necessity for the covered servicemember to have such periodic care, and
an estimate of the treatment schedule for such appointments,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(7)  If an employee
requests leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis to care for a
covered servicemember other than for planned medical treatment, whether there
is a medical necessity for the covered servicemember to have such periodic
care, which can include assisting in the covered servicemember’s recovery, and
an estimate of the frequency and duration of the periodic care,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(8)  Name and
address of the employee requesting leave, the name of the covered
servicemember, and the relationship of the employee to the covered servicemember,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(9)  Whether the
covered servicemember is a current member of the Armed Forces and his or her
military branch, rank, and current unit assignment, and if so, whether he or
she is assigned to a military medical facility as an outpatient or to a unit
established for the purpose of providing command and control of members of the
Armed Forces received medical care as outpatients, and the name of the medical
treatment facility or unit, or whether he or she is on the temporary disability
retired list, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(10)  Whether the
covered servicemember is a veteran, the date of separation from military
service, and whether the separation was other than dishonorable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer may use
the DOL’s optional form WH-385 for current servicemembers or form WH-385-V for
covered veterans.  An employer who uses form WH-385 or WH-385-V or another form
containing the same basic information may not require any information beyond
that specified in the regulations.  See 29 CFR 825.310(b) and (c) for
the information permitted on the certification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   When an
employer requires an employee to submit certification to support military
caregiver leave, the employer is required to accept a copy of Invitational
Travel Orders (ITO) or an Invitational Travel Authorization (ITA) in place of
the certification.  The ITO/ITA is sufficient certification for the duration of
time specified in the ITO/ITA and regardless of whether the employee is named
in the order or authorization.  If the employee’s need for leave extends beyond
the period covered by the ITO/ITA, an employer may request certification for
the remainder of the leave period.  The employer may require the employee to
provide confirmation of the family relationship between the employee and the
covered servicemember.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   When an
employer requires the employee to submit certification to support military
caregiver leave, the employer is required to accept a copy of the covered
servicemember’s enrollment in the Department of Veterans Affairs Program of
Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers as certification of the
servicemember’s serious injury or illness.  The enrollment documentation is
sufficient certification of the servicemember’s serious injury or illness
regardless of whether the employee is the named caregiver in the enrollment
documentation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The employee is still
responsible for providing the employer with additional relevant information,
such as that the veteran is within five years of discharge, the probable
duration of the serious injury or illness, and the veteran’s need for care and
an estimate of the time period during which care will be needed.  The employer
may require the employee to provide confirmation of the family relationship
between the employee and the covered servicemember.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>78 FR 8858</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   An
employer may seek authentication and clarification of a certification for
military caregiver leave, including authentication and clarification of an
ITO/ITA or the documentation indicating a servicemember’s enrollment in the
Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family
Caregivers.  See 29 CFR 825.307.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   An
employer may require second and/or third opinions when leave to care for a
covered servicemember is certified by a non-military affiliated health care
provider, as described in FOH 39h07(a).  An employer may not require second
and/or third opinions for leave to care for a covered servicemember when the
leave is certified by a military-affiliated health care provider as described
in FOH 39h07(a).  Additionally, the recertification process does not apply to
leave taken to care for a covered servicemember.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.310</p>

<h3>39i00 - Maintaining group health
plan benefits.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An
employer is required to maintain an employee’s health benefit coverage under
any group health plan for the duration of any FMLA leave period at the level
and under the conditions that coverage would have been provided if the employee
had remained continuously employed during the entire FMLA leave period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   A group
health plan is any employer plan, or plan contributed to by an employer, to
provide health care to employees, former employees, or the families of such
employees.  Such plans may include a self-insured plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   A group
health plan does not include insurance programs providing health coverage where
employees purchase individual policies from insurers, provided that:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  No
contributions are made by the employer,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Participation
in the program is completely voluntary for employees,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The sole
functions of the employer with respect to the program are, without endorsing
the program, to permit the insurer to publicize the program to employees, to
collect premiums through payroll deductions, and to remit them to the insurer,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The employer
receives no consideration in the form of cash or otherwise in connection with
the program, other than reasonable compensation, excluding any profit, for
administrative services actually rendered in connection with payroll deduction,
and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  The premium
charged with respect to such coverage does not increase in the event the
employment relationship terminates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   If an
employer provides a new health plan or benefits, or changes health options
while an employee is on FMLA leave, the employee is entitled to the new or
changed benefits to the same extent as if the employee were not on leave.  Any
plan changes that apply to all employees would apply to an employee on FMLA
leave.  Notice of any opportunity to change plans or benefits must be given to
an employee on FMLA leave and such change in benefits must be made available
while an employee is on FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   An
employer must maintain benefit coverage during an employee’s FMLA leave for
dental care, eye care, mental health counseling, etc. if such coverage is
provided in the employer’s group health plan, including a supplement to a group
health plan, whether or not provided through a flexible spending account or
other component of a cafeteria plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   If the
employer is providing health insurance to discharge the health and welfare
benefits requirement under an SCA wage determination, that benefit must
continue during the entire period of the FMLA leave.  If an employer pays cash
wages in lieu of the health and welfare benefits, the employer is not required
to continue such payments while the employee is on FMLA leave.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>39i01 - Maintaining non-health
benefits.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The
taking of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit
accrued prior to the commencement of the leave, except for the use of accrued
paid leave to substitute for unpaid FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2614(a)(2)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   An
employee’s entitlement to benefits other than group health benefits during a
period of FMLA leave is determined by the employer’s established policy for
providing such benefits when an employee is on other forms of leave, paid or
unpaid, as appropriate.  If benefits such as vacation or holiday pay accrue to
employees on other types of paid and/or unpaid non-FMLA leave, employees on corresponding
paid or unpaid FMLA leave are entitled to such accrual.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.209(h)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Maintenance
of other benefits, including health insurance policies that are not part of the
employer’s group health plan, are the sole responsibility of the employee.  The
employee and the insurer should make necessary arrangements for payment of
premiums during periods of unpaid FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.210(a),
825.212(a)(2)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   An
employee’s right to continue living in employer-provided housing is determined
by the employer’s established policy.  If the policy provides that employees on
leave for both FMLA and non-FMLA reasons must vacate the property, the employer
will not be in violation of the FMLA so long as the employer restores the
employee the lodging upon completion of the FMLA leave.  The employer may not,
however, require an FMLA‑eligible employee to vacate the employer‑provided
lodging during the term of an FMLA leave period as an attempt to interfere with
or restrain an employee's attempt to exercise rights under the FMLA.</p>

retain group health benefits.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An employee may
choose not to retain group health plan coverage during FMLA leave.  However,
the employee retains his or her entitlement to be reinstated after the leave on
the same terms as prior to taking the leave, without any qualifying period,
physical exam, exclusion of pre-existing conditions, etc.  See FOH 39j.</p>

<h3>39i03 - Payment of group health
plan premiums.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Any share of group
health plan premiums paid by the employee prior to FMLA leave must continue to
be paid by the employee during the FMLA leave period.  If premiums are raised
or lowered, the employee is required to pay the new premium rates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Employers paying
money through a flexible saving account or other component of a “cafeteria plan,”
a portion of which the employee uses to pay the premium payments for the employer’s
group health plan (including dental care, eye care, mental health counseling,
substance abuse treatment, etc.), must continue to pay that same amount to the
cafeteria plan during the period of FMLA leave.</p>

FMLA-2006-3-A</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Payment
when FMLA leave is paid</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  If accrued paid
leave is substituted for unpaid FMLA leave, the employee’s share of premiums
must be paid by the method normally used during any paid leave, presumably as a
payroll deduction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  An employee who
is receiving payments from a workers’ compensation injury must make
arrangements with the employer for payment of group health plan benefits when
simultaneously taking FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Payment
when FMLA leave is unpaid</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  If FMLA leave
is unpaid, the employer has a number of options for obtaining payment from the
employee for the employee’s share of the premium.  The employer may require
that payment be made to the employer or to the insurance carrier, but no
additional charge may be added for administrative expenses.  The employer must
provide advanced written notice to the employee with the terms and conditions
for payments to be made.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The employer
may require the employee to pay in any of the following ways:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     Payment
due at the same time as if made by payroll deduction,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Payment
due on the same schedule as under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c.     At
the employee’s option, payment prepaid to a cafeteria plan,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>d.     Payment
according to the employer’s existing rules for payment by employees on leave
without pay, provided these rules do not require payment prior to the start of
leave or premiums higher than if the employee had continued to work, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e.     Another
system voluntarily agreed to between the employer and the employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer may not require more of an employee
using unpaid FMLA leave than other employees on leave without pay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.210</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39i04 - Maintenance of benefits
under multi-employer health plans.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   A
multi-employer health plan is a plan to which more than one employer is required
to contribute and is maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining
agreements between employee organizations and the employers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   An
employer under a multi-employer plan must continue to make contributions on
behalf of an employee using FMLA leave as though the employee were continuously
employed, unless the plan contains an explicit FMLA provision for maintaining
coverage such as through pooled contributions by all employers party to the
plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   An
employee using FMLA leave cannot be required to use “banked” hours or pay a
greater premium than he or she would have had to pay if he or she had been
continuously employed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.211</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39i05 - Valid reasons for ending
employee group health plan coverage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Group
health plan coverage must be maintained for an employee on FMLA leave until:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employee
fails to return from leave or continues on leave after exhausting his or her
FMLA entitlement,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The employer
can show that the employment relationship would have terminated if the employee
had not taken FMLA leave, such as if the employee would have been laid off and not
transferred to a new position, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The employee
provides unequivocal notice of intent not to return to work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Additionally,
under certain conditions, an employer may end group health plan coverage when
an employee on FMLA leave fails to submit a required premium payment (see
FOH 39i06 for details and requirements) or an employee chooses not to
retain group health coverage during the FMLA leave (see FOH39i02).  All other
obligations of an employer under the FMLA would continue, such as the
obligation to reinstate the employee upon return from leave and restoring the
employee’s benefits equivalent to those that the employee would have had if the
employee had not taken leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   To
discontinue health benefit coverage under a multi-employer health plan based on
termination of the employment relationship, the employer must demonstrate the
employee would not have continued to be employed by either the employer or
another employer who is a member of the same plan.  For example, if the
employee’s construction site is closed but its employees are moved to another
site to continue employment for that employer or another member of the plan, it
can be assumed that the employee on leave would have continued employment and
therefore the employer may not discontinue health benefit coverage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHD Non-Administrator
Letter FMLA-14 November 3, 1993</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   An
employer may cease health benefit coverage when an employee elects to withdraw
from coverage during FMLA leave provided that the decision is truly voluntary
and future reinstatement would not be barred by the terms of the plan or the
employer.  See FOH 39j03.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.209(f),
825.211(e), 825.212</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39i06 - Employee failure to pay
premiums.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An employer’s
obligation to maintain health insurance coverage ceases under the FMLA if an
employee’s premium payment is more than 30 days late, unless the employer has
an established policy providing a more generous grace period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Dropping
employee coverage</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to drop the
coverage for an employee whose premium payment is late, the employer must
provide written notice to the employee that the payment has not been received. 
Such notice must be mailed to the employee at least 15 days before coverage is to
cease, advising that coverage will be dropped on a specified date at least 15
days after the date of the letter unless the payment has been received before
then.  Coverage for the employee may be terminated at the end of the 30-day
grace period (where the 15 day notice has been provided) unless the employer
has established policies regarding other forms of unpaid leave that allow the
employer to end coverage retroactively to the date the unpaid premium payment
was due.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Restoration
of benefits entitlement remains</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  When coverage
lapses because the employee has not made required premium payments or any other
valid reason, upon the employee’s return to work the employer must restore the
employee to coverage and benefits that are equivalent to those the employee
would have had if leave had not been taken and the premium payment(s) had not
been missed or coverage had not been canceled, including family or dependent
coverage.  The employee cannot be required to meet any qualification
requirements imposed by the plan, including any preexisting condition requirements
or waiting period, to wait for an open season, or to pass a medical examination
to obtain reinstatement of coverage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  If an employer
fails to restore the employee’s health insurance upon the employee’s return to
work, the employer may be liable for benefits lost, for other actual monetary
losses sustained as a direct result, and for appropriate equitable relief
tailored to the harm suffered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Employer
payment of employee’s share of premium payments</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer may
choose to pay an employee’s share of premium payments continuously while the
employee is on FMLA leave.  For example, an employer may choose to maintain an
employee’s group health plan benefits or other benefits, such as life insurance
or disability insurance, during an employee’s FMLA leave to avoid a lapse of
coverage and ensure that it can meet its responsibilities to provide equivalent
benefits upon the employee’s return to work.  If the employer elects to
maintain such benefits during the leave, at the conclusion of the leave, the
employer is entitled to recover the costs incurred for paying for the
employee’s share of any premiums whether or not the employee returns to work.  See
FOH 39i07.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.212</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39i07 - Employer recovery of
benefit costs.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   If the
employer pays the employee’s share of premium payments to maintain health plan coverage
when the employee fails to make payments, the employer may recover that expense
from the employee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   In
addition, the employer may recover its share of health plan premiums during a
period of unpaid FMLA leave from the employee if the employee fails to return
to work after the FMLA leave entitlement has been exhausted or expires. 
However, the employer may not recover its costs if the employee does not return
due to a continued need for leave for a serious health condition of the
employee or eligible family member, or a serious illness or injury of a covered
servicemember, or to other circumstances beyond the employee’s control.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  When the
employer cannot recover its share of benefit payments due to the employee’s continued
need for FMLA leave, the employer may require medical certification of the
serious health condition of the employee or family member or the serious injury
or illness of a covered servicemember.  If the employer requires such medical
certification, the certification must be provided to the employer within 30
days of the employer’s request.  It is the employee’s responsibility to provide
the certification and pay any cost incurred.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  If the employee
fails to provide the certification, or the reason for leave does not meet the
test of circumstances beyond the employee’s control, the employer may recover
100 percent of the health benefit premiums it paid during the period of unpaid
FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   If an
employer elects to maintain other benefits by paying the employee’s share of
premiums during unpaid FMLA leave, such as life insurance, disability
insurance, etc., at the conclusion of the leave, the employer is entitled to
recover only the costs incurred for paying the employee’s share of any
premiums, whether or not the employee returns to work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHD Opinion Letter
FMLA-2006-3-A</p>
<p>WHD Non-Administrator
Letter FMLA-6 October 1, 1993</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   For the
purposes of the employer’ recovery of benefit costs, an employee who has
returned to work for at least 30 calendar days is considered to have “returned”
to work.  An employee who transfers directly from taking FMLA leave to
retirement or who retires during the first 30 days after returning to work is
deemed to have returned to work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   When paid
leave is substituted for FMLA leave, the employer may not recover its share of
benefit premiums for any period of the FMLA leave covered by the paid leave. 
Similarly, when FMLA leave runs concurrently with paid leave provided under
workers’ compensation or a temporary disability plan, recovery of premiums does
not apply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Self-insured
employers may recover only the employer’s share of allowable premiums as
calculated under COBRA, excluding the 2 percent fee for administrative costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Any share
of premiums that the employer is entitled to collect when an employee fails to
return to work is a debt owed by the employee to the employer.  Such a debt
does not alter the employer’s responsibilities for health benefit coverage or
payment of claims incurred during the FMLA leave under a self-insurance plan. 
The employer may recover the costs through deductions from any sums due to the
employee as allowed under State and Federal law, or the employer may initiate legal
action against the employee to recover such costs.</p>

<h3>39j00 - General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Upon
return from FMLA leave, an employee is entitled to be restored to the position
held when the leave commenced or to an equivalent position with equivalent
employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.  An
employee is entitled to such reinstatement even if the employee has been
replaced or his or her position has been restructured to accommodate the
employee’s absence.  See FOH 39L for specials rules applicable to school
employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2614(a)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.214</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   If the
returning employee is no longer qualified for the position because of his or
her inability to continue to meet job requirements as a result of the leave
(for example, attend a necessary course, renew a license, fly a minimum number
of hours, etc.), the employer must give the employee a reasonable opportunity
to fulfill those conditions after he or she returns to work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.215(b)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   If an
employee would have been laid off had he or she not been on FMLA leave, the
employee’s right to reinstatement is whatever it would have been had the
employee not been on leave when the layoff occurred.  If a position has been
eliminated, the employer bears the burden of establishing that the job would
have been eliminated and the employee not otherwise employed at the time of restoration
if the employee had continued to work instead of taking leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.216(a)(1)</p>
<p>60 FR 2180, 2213</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   If the
provisions of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) govern an employee’s
return to work, those provisions will apply to the extent they do not conflict
with the FMLA.  For example, if the CBA prohibits a fitness-for-duty
certification, the employer may not require one even though such certification
is typically permitted if administered in accordance with 29 USC
2614(a)(4) and 29 CFR 825.312.  Conversely, even if the CBA allows the
employer to return the employee to a different, non-equivalent position because
of seniority, the employer remains bound by the equivalent-position
requirements of the FMLA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2652</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.700(a)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39j01 - Equivalent position.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Equivalent position
means a position that is virtually identical to the employee’s former position
in terms of pay, benefits and working conditions, including privileges,
perquisites and status.  The position must involve the same or substantially
similar duties and responsibilities, which require substantially equivalent
skill, effort, responsibility, and authority.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.215(a)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39j02 - Equivalent pay.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Pay
increases or changes</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  An employee is
entitled to any unconditional pay increase which may have occurred during the
FMLA leave period, such as cost of living increases.  An employee is also
entitled to be restored to a position with the same or equivalent pay premiums,
such as a shift differential.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Pay increases
based on seniority, length of service, or work performed must be applied
according to the employer’s policy for other employees on an equivalent leave
status for a non-FMLA reason.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Bonuses</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Equivalent pay
includes any bonus or payment, whether it is discretionary or
non-discretionary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  If a bonus is
based on the achievement of a specified goal (hours worked, products sold, perfect
attendance, etc.) and the employee has not met the goal due to FMLA leave, the
payment may be denied unless the employer pays such a bonus to other employees
on an equivalent leave status for non-FMLA reasons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, if an employer policy does not
disallow an attendance bonus to an employee who takes vacation leave, the
employer cannot deny the bonus to an employee who takes vacation leave for an
FMLA purpose (i.e., substitutes paid vacation leave for FMLA leave).  However,
if an employer does not count vacation leave against an attendance bonus but
does count unpaid leave against the bonus, the employer may deny the bonus to
an employee who takes 12 weeks of FMLA leave, two weeks of which the employee
substituted paid vacation leave, but ten of which the employee takes as unpaid
FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Penalizing an employee for taking FMLA leave
under a no-fault attendance policy is distinct from disqualifying an employee
from a bonus or award for attendance because the former faults an employee for
taking leave and the latter denies a reward for achieving the job-related
performance goal of perfect attendance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>73 FR 67934, 67985</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.215(c)</p>
<p>  </p>

<h3>39j03 - Equivalent benefits.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   “Benefits”
includes all benefits provided or made available to employees by an employer,
including group life insurance, health insurance, disability insurance, sick
leave, annual leave, educational benefits, and pensions, regardless of whether
such benefits are provided by a practice or written policy of an employer
through an employee benefit plan.  Benefits accrued at the time leave began
must be available to an employee upon return from leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   For
purposes of pension plans or other retirement plans, any period of unpaid FMLA
leave is not treated as a break in service for vesting and eligibility
purposes.  If such a plan requires an employee to be employed on a specific
date in order to be credited with a year of service for vesting, contributions,
or participation purposes, an employee on unpaid FMLA leave on that date is deemed
to be employed on that date.  However, unpaid FMLA leave periods do not have to
count as credited service for benefit accrual, vesting, or eligibility
purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Employees
on unpaid FMLA leave are to be treated as if they continued to work for purposes
of changes to benefit plans.  Such employees are entitled to changes in
benefits plans unless the changes are dependent on seniority or accrual during
the leave period.  For example, if the benefit plan is based on a
pre-established number of hours worked each year and the employee does not have
sufficient hours as a result of taking unpaid FMLA leave, the benefit is lost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.215(d)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39j04 - Equivalent terms and
conditions of employment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An
equivalent position must have substantially similar duties, conditions,
responsibilities, privileges, and status as the employee’s original position.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The
employee must be reinstated to the same worksite or one that does not involve a
significant increase in commuting time or distance.  If the original worksite
has been closed, the employee is entitled to the same rights as if he or she
had not been on leave at the time of closing.  For example, the employee would
have the same transfer rights as other employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   An
employee is ordinarily entitled to return to the same shift or to the same or
equivalent schedule.  An employer may accommodate an employee’s request to be
restored to a different shift, schedule, or position which better suits the
employee’s personal needs on return from leave.  Similarly, an employer may
offer a promotion to a better position.  However, an employee may not be
induced by the employer to accept a different position against the employee’s
wishes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   The
employee must have the same opportunity for bonuses, profit-sharing, and other
similar discretionary and non-discretionary payments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.215(e)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39j05 - De minimis exception.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The requirement that
an employee be restored to the same or equivalent job as to pay, benefits, and
terms and conditions of employment, does not extend to de minimis, intangible,
or unmeasurable aspects of the job.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.215(f)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39j06 - Limitations to employee
reinstatement.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Limited
exceptions provide for an employer to deny job restoration to an employee when:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employment
relationship ended and would have even if the employee had been continuously
working,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  A key
employee’s reinstatement would cause substantial and grievous economic injury
to the employer, see FOH 39j06(g),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The employee is
unable to perform an essential function of his or her job because of a physical
or mental condition, or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The employee
fraudulently obtained FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.216(a) and (b)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   If an employee
chooses not to or is unable to return to work after exhausting his or her FMLA
leave, all entitlements and rights under the FMLA cease at that time.  The
employee is no longer entitled to any further job restoration rights under the FMLA
and may be terminated.</p>

<p>WHD Non-Administrator
Letter FMLA-91 December 9, 1997</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   No
greater right</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An employee on FMLA
leave maintains the same rights he or she would have if the employee had
continued to work instead of taking FMLA leave.  This applies to reinstatement
and other benefits and conditions of employment.  An employer must be able to
show that an employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time for
reinstatement in order to deny restoration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, an
employee is not entitled to restoration at the end of 12 workweeks if the
employee is laid off during the leave, the employee’s shift has been
eliminated, or the term or project for which the employee was hired has ended. 
An employer would have the burden of proving the employee would have been laid
off, the shift would have been eliminated, or the term or project for which the
employee was hired would have ended during the leave period.</p>

<p>29 CFR 825.216(a)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Unable to
perform an essential function</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If an employee
returning from FMLA leave is unable to perform an essential function of the
position, the employee has no right to restoration to another position under
the FMLA and the FMLA does not require the employer to create a position that
did not previously exist.  However, the employer may have obligations under the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), State or other laws governing
restoration.</p>

<p>(e)   Outside
employment</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The FMLA does not
prohibit an employee from working at a second job while on FMLA leave unless
the employer has a uniformly applied policy against outside or supplemental
employment.  An employer which does not have such a policy may not deny
benefits to which an employee is entitled under the FMLA on this basis unless
the FMLA leave was fraudulently obtained.</p>

restoration or maintenance of health benefits provisions.</p>

<p>29 CFR 825.216(d)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Key
employee</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  An employer may
deny job restoration to a key employee if the denial is necessary to prevent
substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     Definition
and determination</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A key employee is a
salaried FMLA-eligible employee who is among the highest paid 10 percent of all
employees employed by the employer within 75 miles of the employee’s worksite. 
The determination of whether a salaried employee is among the highest paid 10
percent is made at the time the employee gives notice of the need for leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     Substantial
and grievous economic injury</p>
<p>1.     In
order to deny restoration to a key employee, the employer must determine that
the employee’s restoration, not his or her absence, will cause “substantial and
grievous economic injury.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     There
is no precise test for determining the level of hardship or injury the employer
must sustain.  If the reinstatement of a key employee threatens the economic
viability of the firm, that would constitute substantial and grievous economic
injury.  A lesser injury which causes substantial, long-term economic injury
would also be sufficient.  Minor inconveniences and costs that the employer
would experience in the normal course of doing business do not constitute
substantial and grievous economic injury.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  An employer who
believes that reinstatement may be denied to a key employee must give written
notice to the employee at the time the employee gives notice of the need for
FMLA leave (or when FMLA leave commences, if earlier) that he or she qualifies
as a key employee.  The employer must also fully inform the employee of the
potential consequences with respect to reinstatement and maintenance of health
benefits if the employer should determine that substantial and grievous
economic injury to the employer's operations will result if the employee is
reinstated from FMLA leave.  An employer who fails to provide such timely
notice will lose its right to deny restoration even if substantial and grievous
economic injury will result from reinstatement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  As soon as an
employer makes a good faith determination that substantial and grievous
economic injury to its operations will result if a key employee is reinstated,
the employer must notify the employee in writing of its determination and that
it cannot deny FMLA leave but that it intends to deny restoration on completion
of the FMLA leave.  The employer must serve this notice either in person or by
certified mail.  This notice must explain the basis for the employer's finding
that substantial and grievous economic injury will result, and, if leave has
commenced, must provide the employee a reasonable time in which to return to
work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  After
notification of the employer’s intent to deny restoration has been given to an
employee, an employee is still entitled to request reinstatement at the end of
the leave period.  The employer must then again determine whether there will be
substantial and grievous economic injury from reinstatement, based on the facts
at that time.  If the determination remains the same, the employer must notify
the employee in writing (in person or by certified mail) of the denial of
restoration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  If an employee
on leave does not return to work in response to the employer's notification of its
intent to deny restoration, the employee continues to be entitled to
maintenance of health benefits and the employer may not recover its cost of
health benefit premiums.  A key employee's rights under the FMLA continue
unless and until the employee either gives notice that he or she no longer
wishes to return to work, or the employer actually denies reinstatement at the
conclusion of the leave period.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>39j07 - “Light duty” job offer.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Under the FMLA, an
employee may not be required to accept a light duty position or a reasonable
accommodation in lieu of taking FMLA leave.  However, the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) may require the employer to offer the employee the
opportunity to take such a position.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   While an
employee cannot be required to accept a light duty position, the FMLA does not
prevent an employee from accepting, voluntarily and without coercion, a light
duty position while recovering from a serious health condition.  If an employee
voluntarily accepts a light duty position, that employee retains the right
under the FMLA to be restored to the same or equivalent position that the
employee had when the employee’s FMLA leave began.  This right to restoration
ceases at the end of the applicable 12-month FMLA leave year.  The time
employed in the light duty position will not count against the employee’s FMLA
entitlement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   If an
employee is on FMLA leave concurrently with a worker’s compensation absence and
the employee’s health care provider certifies that the employee is able to
return to work in a light duty position and the employer offers the employee
such a position, the employee is not required under the FMLA to accept it. 
However, if the employee refuses the light duty position, he or she may lose his
or her workers’ compensation benefits.  In such a situation, the employee
retains the right to continue on protected leave under the FMLA until the
employee can return to his or her position or the FMLA entitlement is
exhausted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Whenever
an employee performs his or her own job for less than a full schedule, the
employee is using intermittent or reduced schedule leave and is not performing
light duty for purposes of the FMLA.  However, if the employee has already used
his or her full entitlement in a 12-month period and then voluntarily accepts a
light duty position, that employee no longer has a right under the FMLA to
restoration.</p>

The special rules do not apply to other kinds of educational institutions, such
as colleges and universities, trade schools, and preschools.</p>

“Instructional employees” are those whose principal function is to teach and
instruct students in a class, a small group, or an individual setting.  This
includes not only teachers, but also athletic coaches, driving instructors, and
special education assistants such as signers for the hearing impaired.  It does
not include teacher assistants or aides who do not have as their principal job
actual teaching or instructing, nor does it include auxiliary personnel such as

<h3>39L01 - Limitations on intermittent
leave.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Leave
taken by an instructional employee for a period that ends with the school year
and begins the next semester is leave taken consecutively rather than
intermittently.  The period during the summer vacation when the employee would
not have been required to report for duty is not counted against the employee’s
FMLA leave entitlement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   An
instructional employee who is on FMLA leave at the end of the school year must
be provided with any benefits over the summer vacation that employees would
normally receive if they had been working at the end of the school year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   When an
instructional employee needs intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave
schedule to care for a family member with a serious health condition, to care
for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, or for the
employee’s own serious health condition, any one of which is foreseeable based
on planned medical treatment, and the employee would be on leave for more than
20 percent of the total number of working days over the period the leave would
extend, the employer may require the employee to choose either:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Take a block of
leave for a particular period or periods not greater than the duration of the
time needed for the planned treatment; or</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Transfer
temporarily to an available alternative position for which the employee is
qualified, which has equivalent pay and benefits and which better accommodates
the leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   If an
employee chooses to take a block of leave for the duration of time needed
instead of transferring temporarily to an available alternative position, the
entire period of leave taken will count as FMLA leave.  See 29 CFR 825.603(a).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   If an
instructional employee does not give the required notice of foreseeable FMLA
leave (see FOH 39f01) to be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave
schedule, the employer may require the employee to take leave of a particular
duration or to transfer temporarily to an alternative position.  Alternatively,
the employer may require the employee to delay the taking of leave until the
notice provision is met.</p>

<h3>39L02 - Limitations on leave taken
near the end of an academic term.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Academic
term means the school semester that typically ends near the end of the calendar
year and the end of spring.  Schools cannot have more than two academic terms
each year for the purposes of the FMLA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   If an
instructional employee begins leave more than five weeks before the end of an
academic term, the employer may require the employee to continue taking leave
until the end of the term if the leave will last at least three weeks, and the
employee would return to work during the three week period before the end of
the term.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   If an
instructional employee begins leave during the five-week period before the end
of the academic term and the leave is for the birth of a child or placement of
a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a spouse, son, daughter or
parent with a serious health condition, or to care for a covered servicemember
with a serious injury or illness, the employer may require the employee to
continue leave until the end of the term if the leave will last more than two
weeks, and the employee would return to work during the two-week period before
the end of the term.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   If an
instructional employee begins leave during the three-week period before the end
of the academic term and the leave is for the birth of a child or placement of
a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a spouse, son, daughter or
parent with a serious health condition, or to care for a covered servicemember
with a serious injury or illness, the employer may require the employee to
continue taking leave until the end of the term if the leave will last more than
five working days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   In the
case of an employee who is required to take leave until the end of an academic
term, only the period of leave until the employee is ready and able to return
to work can be charged against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement.  The
employer has the option not to require the employee to stay on leave until the
end of the school term; therefore any additional leave required by the employer
to the end of the school term is not counted as FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, the employer
must maintain the employee's group health insurance and restore the employee to
the same or equivalent job including other benefits at the conclusion of the
leave.</p>

<p>29 CFR 825.602</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39L03 - Restoration to an
equivalent position.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The
determination of how an employee is to be restored to an equivalent position
upon return from FMLA leave will be made on the basis of established school
board policies and practices, private school policies and practices, and
collective bargaining agreements.  Such policies or agreements must be in
writing, must be made known to the employee prior to the taking of FMLA leave,
and must clearly explain the employee's restoration rights upon return from
leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The
taking of FMLA leave shall not result in the loss of any employment benefit
accrued prior to the date the leave begins.  For example, a probationary
teacher who takes a FMLA-qualifying leave cannot be required to begin the
probationary period again upon return to work.  The employer is not required to
allow the accrual of any additional seniority or employment benefit during the
period of unpaid leave, but must restore the employee to those benefits already
earned.</p>

Letter FMLA-80 April 24, 1996</p>

<h3>39m00 - General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The FMLA
was amended by the Airline Flight Crew Technical Corrections Act (AFCTCA),
which established a special hours of service eligibility provision for airline
flight crew members and flight attendants (airline flight crew employees). The
AFCTCA also authorized the Department to provide a method of calculation of
leave for airline flight crew employees and to establish special recordkeeping
requirements for these provisions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   These
special rules apply only to airline flight crew employees, i.e., pilots,
co-pilots, flight attendants and flight engineers. They do not apply to other
employees of the airlines, such as those in positions in reservations and
baggage departments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   This
section addresses the special rules for airline flight crew employees including
the special hours of service requirement for eligibility, the method for
calculating leave usage, and special recordkeeping requirements applicable to
these employees.  All other FMLA provisions, including the additional FMLA eligibility
criteria (see 29 CFR 825.110), apply to airline flight crew employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2611(2)(D),
2612(a)(5)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.800-825.803</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39m01 - Eligibility – hours of
service requirement.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Eligibility
requirement</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An airline flight
crew employee is eligible for FMLA leave if he or she works for an FMLA-covered
employer, has been employed by the employer for at least 12 months, is employed
at a worksite with 50 or more employees at that site or within 75 miles of the
worksite, and meets the specified hours of service during the previous 12
months by:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Having worked
or been paid for not less than 60 percent of the employee’s applicable monthly
guarantee (or its equivalent), and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Having worked
or been paid for not less than 504 hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The
applicable monthly guarantee for an airline flight crew employee who is:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  On reserve
status is the minimum number of hours an employer has agreed to pay the
employee for any given month as established by a CBA or, if none exists, employer
policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  On non-reserve
status (line holder) is the minimum number of hours an employer has agreed to
schedule the employee for any given month.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   For
purposes of the 504-hours requirement:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Whether the
employee has worked the 504 hours is assessed by reviewing the employee’s duty
hours during the previous 12-month period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Whether the
employee has been paid the 504 hours is assessed by reviewing the number of
hours for which the employee received wages during the previous 12-month
period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  The 504 hours
do not include personal commute time or time spent on vacation, medical, or
sick leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   An
airline flight crew employee returning from USERRA-covered service shall be
credited with the hours of service that would have been performed but for the
period of absence from work due to or necessitated by USERRA-covered service.
The employee’s pre-service work schedule can generally be used to determine the
hours that would have been worked or paid during the period of absence from
work due to or necessitated by USERRA-covered service. See FOH 39n04.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2611(2)(D)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.801</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39m02 - Calculation of leave.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   These special
calculation of leave provisions apply to airline flight crew employees only.  For
employees other than airline flight crew employees, see FOH 39e.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The rules governing
calculation of intermittent or reduced schedule FMLA leave set forth in 29 CFR
825.205 do not apply to airline flight crew employees except that such employees
are subject to the physical impossibility rule.  See FOH 39e01(d).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Airline
flight crew employees are entitled to a fixed a number of days for taking leave
for FMLA-qualifying reasons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Leave for any
FMLA-qualifying reason other than military caregiver leave</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An FMLA-eligible airline flight crew employee
is entitled to 72 days of FMLA leave during any 12-month period for one or more
of the FMLA-qualifying reasons other than military caregiver leave (i.e., leave
for the birth of a child and to care for the newborn child; placement with the
employee of a child for adoption or foster care and to care for the
newly-placed child; to care for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent with a
serious health condition; because of the employee’s own serious health
condition; or because of a qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the
employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a military member on covered
active duty).  See 29 CFR 825.112(a)(1)-(5).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 72-day entitlement is based on a uniform
6-day workweek for all airline flight crew employees, regardless of time
actually worked or paid, multiplied by the statutory 12-workweek entitlement
for FMLA leave.  This number corresponds to the maximum 6-day workweek an
airline flight crew employee can work under FAA regulations. (6-day workweek x
12 workweeks of FMLA leave = 72 days of FMLA leave entitlements.)  For example,
if an employee took 3 weeks of FMLA leave for an FMLA-qualifying reason other
than military caregiver leave, the employee would use 18 days (6 days x 3
weeks) of FMLA entitlement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Military
caregiver leave</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An FMLA-eligible airline flight crew employee
is entitled to 156 days of military caregiver leave during a single 12-month
period to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness.
(6-day workweek x 26 workweek entitlement for military caregiver leave = 156
days.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Intermittent or
reduced schedule leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When an airline flight crew employee takes
intermittent or reduced schedule FMLA-leave, the employer must account for the
leave using an increment no greater than one calendar day.  For example, if an
airline flight crew employee needs to take FMLA leave for a two-hour physical
therapy appointment, the employer may require the employee to use a full day of
FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.802</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39m03 - Special recordkeeping requirements.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Covered
employers of airline flight crew employees are required to make, keep, and
preserve records pertaining to FMLA leave pursuant to 29 CFR 825.500.  See FOH
39k.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Covered
employers of airline flight crew employees must also maintain the following additional
records and documents:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Documents
containing information specifying the applicable monthly guarantee with respect
to each category of employee to whom such guarantee applies, including copies
of  any relevant collective bargaining agreements or employer policy documents,
and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Records of
hours worked and hours paid.  See 29 CFR 825.801(b)(2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.803</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39n00 - State family and medical
leave laws.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Nothing
in the FMLA supersedes any provision of state or local law that provides
greater family and medical leave rights than those contained in the FMLA.  The
Wage and Hour Division does not enforce provisions of state family or medical
leave laws, and states may not enforce the FMLA.  Employees are not required to
indicate whether the leave they are taking is FMLA leave or leave under state law,
and an employer must comply with the applicable provisions of both.  If leave
qualifies for FMLA leave and leave under state law, the leave used counts
against the employee’s entitlement under both laws.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   States
that have enacted family and medical leave provisions include California,
Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, as well as the District of Columbia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2651(b)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.701</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39n01 - Federal and state
anti-discrimination laws.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The purpose of the
FMLA is to make leave available to eligible employees and employers within its
coverage and not to limit already existing rights and protections.  An employer
who violates both the FMLA and a state or federal discrimination law may be
subject to remedies under either or both statutes.  Double relief may not be
awarded for the same loss.  When remedies coincide, a claimant may be allowed
to utilize whichever avenue of relief is desired.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.702(a)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The ADA’s
“disability” and the FMLA’s “serious health condition” are different concepts
and must be analyzed separately.  The leave provisions of the FMLA are wholly
distinct from the reasonable accommodation obligations of employers covered
under the ADA, employers who receive federal financial assistance, employers
who contract with the federal government, or the federal government itself.  An
employer must provide leave under whichever statutory provision provides the
greater rights and protection.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The ADA is
enforced by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (<a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">http://www.eeoc.gov</a> or (800)

<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Pregnancy
Discrimination Act (PDA)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The PDA amended
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and requires employers to provide the
same benefits for women who are pregnant as to other employees with short-term
disabilities.  An employee employed for less than 12 months by the employer
(and therefore not an FMLA -eligible employee) may not be denied maternity
leave if the employer normally provides short-term disability benefits to
employees with the same tenure who are experiencing other short-term
disabilities because Title VII does not require employees to be employed for a
certain period of time to be protected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  The PDA is
enforced by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (<a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">http://www.eeoc.gov</a> or (800)

<h3>39n02 - Workers’ compensation.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An employee may be on
a workers’ compensation absence due to an on-the-job injury or illness which
also qualifies as a serious health condition under the FMLA.  The workers’
compensation absence and FMLA leave may run concurrently.  Although an employer
may offer a light duty position in the event the employee’s health care
provider who is providing medical care for the workers’ compensation injury
certifies that the employee is able to return to work in a light duty position,
the employee may, but is not required to, accept the position.  If the employee
does not accept the light duty position, the employee is entitled to continue
on FMLA-protected leave either until the employee is able to return to the same
or equivalent job the employee left or until the employee’s FMLA leave
entitlement is exhausted.  See also FOH 39j07.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the employee
refuses a light duty assignment he or she may lose workers’ compensation
benefits.  Such an employee, however, may not be subjected to any form of
disciplinary action for having exercised his or her statutory rights to
continue FMLA leave.</p>

<h3>39n03 - Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act (COBRA).</h3>
<p>            </p>
<p>(a)   The COBRA
provides for employees who would lose health care coverage because of reduced
work hours or job termination to continue group health coverage for themselves
and their families for limited periods of time.  Such coverage may become
applicable when it becomes known that an employee is not returning to
employment and ceases to be entitled to FMLA leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Additional
information regarding COBRA may be obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor’s
Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) (<a href="http://www.dol.gov/cobra">http://www.dol.gov/cobra</a>
or (866) 444-3272).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39n04 - Uniformed Services Employment
and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The
USERRA requires that returning servicemembers are entitled to receive all
rights and benefits of employment that they would have obtained if they had
been continuously employed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Under the USERRA, a
returning servicemember would be eligible for FMLA leave if the months and
hours that he or she would have worked for the civilian employer during the absence
from work due to or necessitated by USERRA-covered service, combined with the
months employed and the hours actually worked, meet the FMLA eligibility
threshold of 12 months and 1,250 hours of service with the employer.  See
29 CFR 825.110(b)(2)(i) and (c)(2), 825.801(c), and FOH 39c.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The
USERRA is enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Veterans Employment and
Training Service (VETS) (<a href="http://www.dol.gov/vets">http://www.dol.gov/vets</a>
or (866) 487-2365).</p>

<h3>39n05 - Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The HIPAA
Privacy Rule governs the privacy of an individual’s individually-identifiable
health information.  The Privacy Rule places restrictions on the use and
disclosure of an individual’s protected health information (PHI) by covered
entities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The
requirements of HIPAA must be satisfied when individually-identifiable health
information is shared with an employer by a HIPAA-covered health care provider.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) enforces the HIPAA (<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr">http://www.hhs.gov/ocr</a> or
(800) 368-1019).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.307(a)</p>

<h3>39o00 - Interference with the right
to take FMLA leave.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An
employer is prohibited from interfering with an employee’s right to take leave
under the FMLA.  Such interference includes refusal to allow an employee to take
FMLA leave, discouraging an employee from using FMLA leave, or manipulation by
the employer to avoid responsibilities under the FMLA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   An
employer is prohibited from discharging or in any other way discriminating or
retaliating against any person, whether or not an employee, for exercising or
attempting to exercise his or her rights under the FMLA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Employers
cannot use the taking of leave as a negative factor in employment actions, such
as hiring, promotions, or discipline.  Leave taken for any FMLA-qualifying
reason may not be assessed points or counted against an employee in any manner
under employer “no fault” attendance plans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Any
violations of the FMLA or its regulations constitute interfering with the
rights provided by the FMLA.  An employer may be liable for compensation and
benefits lost by because of the violation, for other actual monetary losses
sustained as a direct result of the violation, and for equitable or other
relief based upon the harm suffered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Employees
cannot waive, or be induced by employers to waive, their future rights under
the FMLA.  For example, employees (individually or through a collective
bargaining agreement (CBA)) cannot trade the right to take FMLA leave for some
other benefit offered by the employer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  However, this
does not prevent the settlement or release of FMLA claims by employees based on
past employer conduct.  Such a settlement does not require approval of the Department
of Labor or a court.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  This also does
not prevent an employee’s voluntary and uncoerced acceptance of a light duty
assignment while recovering from a serious health condition.  Such an
acceptance cannot be a condition of employment and does not constitute a waiver
of the employee’s future rights, including the right to be restored to the same
or equivalent position the employee held when the employee’s FMLA leave began. 
However, the employee’s right to restoration ceases at the end of the
applicable 12-month FMLA leave year.  See FOH 39j07.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   No
provision in the FMLA will diminish any protection or greater benefit provided
by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA).  On the other hand, no provision of
the FMLA can be diminished by any provision of a CBA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2615(a)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.220,825.700</p>

<h3>39o01 - Interference with
proceedings or inquiries.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An
employer is prohibited from discharging or in any other way discriminating
against any person, whether or not an employee, for opposing or complaining
about any unlawful practice under the FMLA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   All
persons, whether or not an employer, are prohibited from discharging or in any
other way discriminating against any person, whether or not an employee,
because that person has filed a charge or instituted a proceeding under the
FMLA, has given or is about to give information related to an FMLA proceeding
or inquiry, or has testified or is about to testify in an FMLA proceeding or
inquiry.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>29 CFR 825.220</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>39o02 - Enforcement.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An
employee who believes his or her rights under the FMLA have been violated has
the choice of filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor or filing a
private lawsuit pursuant to section 107 of the FMLA. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2617(a)</p>
<p>29 CFR 825.400</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   A
complaint may be filed in person, by mail, or by telephone with any local
office of the Wage and Hour Division.  The FMLA provides a two-year statute of
limitations or three years in the case of a willful violation.  The complaint
should be filed within a reasonable time of when the employee discovers that his
or her FMLA rights have been violated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 CFR 825.401</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The FMLA
also provides for enforcement procedures through the courts.  An employee is
not required to file a complaint with the Wage and Hour Division prior to
bringing a private action in court.  A state employee’s private right of action
may be limited by the sovereign immunity provision of the Eleventh Amendment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>29 USC 2617</p>

<h3>46a00 - Purpose.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The H-2B provisions of the Immigration and
Nationality Act (INA) provide for the admission of nonimmigrants to the United
States to perform temporary non-agricultural labor or services. See 8 USC §
1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b). This chapter provides information on regulations and
interpretations with respect to the Wage and Hour Division’s (WHD) enforcement authority
under the H-2B nonimmigrant program.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>46a01 - H-2B petition process.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   ETA. The H-2B
petition process begins when the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) certifies
that the prospective H-2B employer performed the required recruitment and was
unable to obtain sufficient numbers of qualified U.S. workers to meet its
temporary employment need. The ETA certifying officer (CO) reviews the complete
Application for Temporary Employment Certification ETA Form 9142 and Appendix B.1
and makes a determination to certify or deny the application. ETA may issue a
Request for Further Information (RFI) to, or at its discretion conduct an audit
of, the employer if ETA believes the employer has not established its need or
met its domestic recruitment obligations. Included within ETA jurisdiction are
determinations related to such issues as justification and appropriate classification
of the temporary need, availability of U.S. workers, positive recruitment,
prevailing wage determinations, methodology for establishing the prevailing
wage, and similar matters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   DHS/USCIS. After
obtaining a certified Application from ETA the employer then submits a petition
to Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
(USCIS). USCIS reviews the petition which includes the certified Application
for Temporary Employment Certification and the DHS Form I-129, Petition for a
Nonimmigrant Worker.  USCIS either approves or denies the petition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   DOS. After the
employer has an adjudicated petition from the USCIS, the Department of State
(DOS) issues the visa to the H-2B workers. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>46a02 - Enforcement authority.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Effective January 18, 2009, WHD was delegated
enforcement authority from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under INA
§ 214(c)(14)(A). This includes authority to impose administrative remedies on
an employer who substantially fails to meet any of the conditions of the
petition to admit or provide status to an H-2B worker or who willfully
misrepresents a material fact on such petition. The regulations for this
program are in 20 CFR Part 655 Subpart A. Questions or complaints concerning
the H-2B program should be directed to the nearest Wage and Hour Division
District Office. See http://www.dol.gov/whd/america2.htm. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On February 21, 2012, the Department issued new Final
Rule for the H-2B program.  77 FR 10038.  On April 26, 2012, the Final Rule was
preliminarily enjoined by the court in Bayou Lawn &amp; Landscape Servs. v.
Solis, No. 3:12-cv-00183-MC-CJK, slip op. (N.D. Fla. Apr. 26, 2012), appeal
docketed, No. 12-12462 (11th Cir. May 15, 2012).  The 2008 H-2B regulations
were not at issue and are not affected by the district court's preliminary
decision in Bayou Lawn.  Rather, as the district court explained, its
preliminary injunction had the effect of &quot;preserving the status quo&quot;
of the 2008 rules.  Bayou Lawn, Slip. Op. at 7.  This FOH Chapter relates to
the 2008 rules only.   </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>46a03 - Coverage.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Employers who
have an approved ETA Form 9142 are covered by the H-2B provisions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The H-2B employer
identified on the Application for Temporary Employment Certification is the
employer responsible for compliance with H-2B requirements and is the subject
of the H‑2B investigation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  A
&quot;successor-in-interest&quot; to the employer listed on the Application for
Temporary Employment Certification may be held responsible for the actions of
its predecessor if the successor has explicitly accepted the predecessor's H‑2B
obligations.  See 20 CFR 655.4.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   H-2B workers
are also entitled to all of same protections as U.S. workers under all other
applicable programs enforced by the WHD, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA), the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA), the
Davis Bacon Act (DBA), the Service Contract Act (SCA), and any other program
enforced by the WHD. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>46a04 - Territory of Guam.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Department of Labor
(DOL) does not certify to USCIS the temporary employment of H‑2B workers, or
enforce compliance with the provisions of the H-2B visa program, in the
Territory of Guam. The administration of the H-2B temporary labor certification
program is performed by the Governor of Guam, or the Governor's designated
representative.  See 20 CFR 655.2 and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(iii-v)</p>

<h3>46b00 - General.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   Starting on
January 18, 2009, an employer seeking to hire H-2B workers must file a
completed Application for Temporary Employment Certification (Application) along
with a copy of the recruitment report with ETA. See 20 CFR 655.20.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Certification
of more than one H-2B position may be requested on a single Application so long
as all H-2B workers being sought will perform the same services or labor on the
same terms and conditions, in the same occupation, in the same area of intended
employment, and during the same period of employment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The Application
for Temporary Employment Certification is valid only for the period of time
between the beginning and ending dates of employment certified by ETA. The
certification expires on the last day of authorized employment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   The Application
is valid only for the number of H‑2B positions, the area of intended
employment, the specific services or labor to be performed, and the employer
specified on the certified Application for Temporary Employment Certification
and may not be transferred from one employer to another. Employers may amend
applications pursuant to 20 CFR 655.34.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>46b01 - Temporary need.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The employer
must establish that its need for non-agricultural services or labor is
temporary, regardless of whether the underlying job is permanent or temporary. See
20 CFR 655.6. The employer must provide a detailed statement regarding its
temporary need as directed in 20 CFR 655.21.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The employer’s
need is considered temporary if it is a one-time occurrence or a seasonal,
peakload, or intermittent need as defined by DHS. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Where a
one-time occurrence lasts longer than one year, the employer must reapply for
certification on an annual basis after performing good-faith recruitment,
except that an employer with an approved need for more than one year, but less
than 18 months will not be required to conduct another labor market test for
the portion of time beyond 12 months. See 20 CFR 655.20(f).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Documentation
and all supporting evidence justifying the need for temporary employment must
be retained by the employer for a period of no less than three years from the
date of the certification.  See 20 CFR 655.21(c).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>46b02 - Pre-filing obligations – recruitment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   General recruitment
obligations. Prior to filing the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification, an employer must perform all necessary steps of the recruitment
process as specified in 20 CFR 655.15. The employer's signature on the Application
for Temporary Employment Certification attests that:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  It has completed
recruitment and found no or insufficient qualified U.S. workers to meet its
temporary need,  and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  That any eligible
U.S. workers who applied for temporary or seasonal employment were either hired
or rejected for lawful, job-related reasons. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Prevailing wage.
The H-2B employer first must obtain a prevailing wage determination (PWD) from
ETA by submitting an ETA Form 9141, Application for Prevailing Wage
Determination. Prevailing wage requests are handled by the ETA National Processing
Center (NPC). Information concerning PWDs may be found at http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/contacts.cfm.
See 20 CFR 655.10.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The NPC will enter the
prevailing wage on the form, indicate the source and validity period, and
return the certified prevailing wage (electronically or by mail) to the employer.
The employer must offer this wage (or higher) to both its H‑2B workers and any
similarly employed U.S. workers hired in response to the recruitment required
as part of the Application for Temporary Employment Certification application. See
20 CFR 655.10(b)(6). “Similarly employed” means having substantially comparable
jobs in the occupational category in the area of intended employment. See 20 CFR
655.10(c).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  No PWD issued for use
on an Application for Temporary Employment Certification permits an employer to
pay a wage lower than the highest wage required by any applicable federal, state,
or local law. See 20 CFR 655.10(h).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Job order. The
employer must submit a job order to the State Workforce Agency (SWA) serving
the area of intended employment no more than 120 calendar days before the
employer’s date of need for H-2B workers, identifying it as a job order to be
placed in connection with a future Application for Temporary Employment
Certification. See 20 CFR 655.15(e).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Advertisements.
The employer must publish two print advertisements for the job which must
contain terms and conditions of employment which are not less favorable than
those to be offered to the H-2B workers and must satisfy all of the following
requirements:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  During the period of time
that the job order is being circulated for clearance by the SWA, the
advertisement must appear on two separate days (may be consecutive) in a
newspaper of general circulation serving the area of intended employment. The
newspaper must have a reasonable distribution and be appropriate to the
occupation and the workers likely to apply for the job opportunity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  One of the advertisements
must be a Sunday advertisement unless the job opportunity is located in a rural
area that does not have a newspaper with a Sunday edition; in such a case the
H-2B employer must, in place of a Sunday edition advertisement, advertise in
the regularly published daily edition with the widest circulation in the area
of intended employment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  If a professional,
trade, or ethnic publication is more appropriate than a general circulation
newspaper for the occupation or the type of workers likely to apply for the job,
and it is the source most likely to bring responses from able, available, and
qualified U.S. workers, the H‑2B employer may use a professional, trade, or
ethnic publication in place of one of the newspaper advertisements, but may not
to replace the Sunday advertisement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>See 20 CFR 655.15 and 655.17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Union. If the
employer is party to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) governing the job
classification, the employer must formally contact the local union as a
recruitment source for able, willing, qualified, and available U.S. workers. This
contact may be made by U.S. mail or other effective means during the period of
time that the job order is being circulated for clearance by the SWA. See 20 CFR
655.15(g).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Layoffs. If the
H-2B employer has laid off U.S. workers in the occupation and area of intended
employment within 120 days of the first date an H‑2B worker is needed as
indicated on the Application for Temporary Employment Certification, the
employer must document that it has notified or will notify each laid-off worker
of the job opportunity and that it has considered or will consider each laid off
worker who expressed interest in the job opportunity, and the result of the
notification and consideration. See 20 CFR 655.15(h).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Recruitment
Report. Per guidelines specified in 20 CFR 655.15(j) the H-2B employer must
prepare, sign, and date a written recruitment report. The recruitment report
must be submitted to the NPC with the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification application.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)  Recruitment Records.
The employer filing the Application must maintain documentation of its
advertising and recruitment efforts for a period of no less than three years
from the date of the certification or from the date of determination if the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification is denied or withdrawn.
Documentation includes:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  A copy of the
recruitment report,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Prevailing wage
documentation,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Resumes of and
evidence of contact with each U.S. worker who applied or was referred to the
job opportunity,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Dated logs
demonstrating that the labor union was contacted and notified of the position
openings and whether it referred qualified U.S. workers, the number of
referrals (if any) or whether the union was non-responsive to the notification,
and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Copies of newspaper
pages, tear sheets of the publication pages, or other proof containing the full
text and dates of the advertisements. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>46b03  Employer obligations - Application for Temporary Employment Certification
information.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The employer
and, where applicable, the employer's attorney/agent attest by signature that they
will abide by the terms, assurances, and obligations in accordance with the
Regulations as a condition of Application for Temporary Employment
Certification approval.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The employer
attests by its signature in Appendix B.1 that it has reviewed the Application
for Temporary Employment Certification and that the information contained is
true and accurate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The following
information is included on the ETA Form 9142 - Application for Temporary
Employment Certification and must be accurately stated by the employer:</p>

<h3>46b04 - Employer obligations - Application for Temporary Employment
Certification Appendix B.1.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer seeking to
employ H-2B workers declares by its signature on the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification that it will meet the conditions of employment in
Appendix B.1.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The job opportunity
must:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Be a bona fide,
full-time temporary position with qualifications that are consistent with normal
and accepted qualifications required by non-H‑2B employers in the same or comparable
occupations. See 20 CFR 655.22(h)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Not be vacant due to
a strike, lockout, or work stoppage in the course of a labor dispute. See 20 CFR
655.22(b).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Be open to any
qualified U.S. worker regardless of race, color, national origin, age, sex,
religion, handicap, or citizenship, and the employer has conducted the required
recruitment, contacted the union and retained records of any U.S. applicant(s)
and the disposition of the application(s). See 20 CFR 655.22(c) and Appendix B
- Conditions 1-3.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   The job offer
must:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Include terms and
working conditions normal to U.S. workers similarly employed in the area of
intended employment and no less favorable than those offered to H-2B workers
and not less than the minimum required terms and conditions. See 20 CFR
655.22(a).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Include an offered
wage that equals or exceeds the highest of the prevailing wage, the applicable federal,
state, or local minimum wage, and the employer must pay the offered wage during
the entire period of the approved Application for Temporary Employment
Certification. See 20 CFR 655.22(e).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Not be based on
commissions, bonuses, or other incentives, unless the employer guarantees a
wage paid on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis that equals or exceeds the prevailing
wage or the legal federal, state, or local minimum wage, whichever is highest. See
20 CFR 655.22(g)(1).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Specify all
deductions not required by law. See 20 CFR 655.22(g)(1) and Appendix B.1 -
Conditions 4-6.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Compliance with
other laws. The employer must comply with applicable federal, state, and local
employment-related laws and regulations, including employment-related health
and safety laws. See 20 CFR 655.22(d) and Appendix B.1 - Condition 7.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   Layoffs. The
employer is prohibited, with certain exceptions, from laying off any similarly
employed U.S. workers in the occupation that is the subject of the Application
for Temporary Employment Certification in the area of intended employment
beginning 120 calendar days before the date of requested need of the first H-2B
workers through 120 calendar days after the date of need. Layoffs are permitted
where the H-2B employer has offered the job to the laid-off U.S. workers and
the U.S. workers refused the job or the U.S. worker was rejected for the job for
lawful, job-related reasons. See 20 CFR § 655.22(i) and Appendix B.1 -
Condition 8.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Fee Recovery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The H-2B employer and
its attorney or agents are prohibited from receiving payment of any kind from an
employee for any activity related to obtaining the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification, including payment of the H-2B employer’s attorney or
agent fees, any fees related to the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification, or recruitment costs. Payments include, but are not limited to,
monetary payments, deductions from wages, salary or benefits, kickbacks,
bribes, and free labor See 20 CFR 655.22(j) and Appendix B.1 - Condition 9.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  FLSA covered employer
with H-2B workers who are not exempt from the FLSA are also responsible for
paying these H-2B workers’ visa fees to the extent that the fees would bring
the worker below the minimum wage. See FOH 46c02.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   Separation from
Employment Notifications.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Upon the separation
from employment of any H-2B workers employed under the Application for
Temporary Employment Certification prior to the end date of the employment
specified in the Application for Temporary Employment Certification, the H-2B
employer must notify ETA and USCIS in writing of the separation from employment
not later than two work days after separation is discovered. See 20 CFR
655.22(f).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  If an H-2B worker is
dismissed by the H-2B employer prior to the end of the period, the H-2B
employer is liable for return transportation.  If the H-2B employer is required,
as a part of the pilot program referenced in § 655.35, it must inform the H-2B
worker of the requirement to leave the United States at the end of the
authorized period of stay or separation from the employer, whichever is earlier,
unless the H‑2B worker will be sponsored by another subsequent employer.  See 8
USC 1184(c)(5); 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(vi)(E); 20 CFR 655.22(m); and Appendix B.1 -
Conditions 10-11.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(g)   Area of
Intended Employment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The employer will not
place any H-2B workers employed pursuant to the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification outside the area of intended employment listed on the Application
for Temporary Employment Certification unless the employer has obtained a new Application
from ETA. See 20 CFR 655.22(l) and Appendix B.1 - Condition 12.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  “Area of intended
employment” means the geographic area within normal commuting distance of the
place (worksite address) of intended employment of the job opportunity for
which the certification is sought. See 20 CFR § 655.4.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a.     An H-2B
worker may have more than one worksite during a certified period of employment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     Multiple
worksites. Employers may not include more than one area of intended
employment on a single 9142, with the exception of itinerant reforestation and
entertainment employers, which are covered by ETA special procedures that are
explained below.  If the employer has multiple worksites within a single area
of intended employment, the workers may be employed at any of the worksites
provided the job duties are identical and the employer has listed all of the
worksites on the 9142 in section F Job Offer Information, subsection c Place of
Employment. The employer must provide enough geographic detail to cover all the
intended worksites.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     Itineraries. 
Employers in the reforestation and entertainment industries have been granted
special procedures by ETA per 20 CFR 655.3 permitting them to place H-2B
workers in multiple areas of intended employment, based on a multi-state
itinerary. See Training and Employment Guidance Letters No. 31-05 (issued May
31, 2006) and No. 27-06 (issued June 12, 2007). Employers who will work H-2B
workers on an itinerary must attach the itinerary to the 9142.  The
employer must list all of the work locations and the duration of work at each
location.  ETA requires the employer to recruit only in one area of
intended employment, typically the area where the work begins. The employer is
required to pay the appropriate prevailing wage at each work location as
identified on the ETA 9141, Application for Prevailing Wage Determination.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b.     An
employer cannot apply for H-2B workers for a job opportunity at a worksite and
in an occupation in which U.S. workers are on strike or locked out. See 20 CFR
655.22(b) and Appendix B - Condition 2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(h)  Temporary Need. The
H-2B employer must accurately state the dates of temporary need, reasons for
temporary need, and number of positions being requested for labor certification.
See 20 CFR 655.22(n) and Appendix B.1 - Condition 13.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(i)    Secondary
Displacement. An H-2B employer that is a job contractor is prohibited from
placing an H-2B worker at a worksite of a secondary/other employer unless:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  The H-2B employer
makes a written, bona fide inquiry as to whether the secondary/other employer
has displaced or intends to displace any similarly employed U.S. workers within
the area of intended employment beginning 120 days before through 120 calendar
days after the date of need. The H-2B job contractor employer must secure a
written confirmation from such secondary/other employer that the employer has
not displaced and does not intend to displace any similarly employed U.S.
workers within the area of intended employment, and</p>
<p>(2)  All worksites where
H-2B workers will be placed are listed on the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification. See 20 CFR 655.22(k) and Appendix B.1 - Condition 14.</p>

<h3>46c00 - Required/offered wage rate.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The H-2B
employer is required to pay at least the highest of the prevailing wage, federal,
state, or local minimum wages. See 20 CFR 655.22(e). The offered wage listed on
the Application for Temporary Employment Certification must meet this
requirement, and the offered wage (including any offered overtime wage rate) must
be paid to H-2B workers and similarly employed U.S. workers who were hired
during the 10 day recruitment period. See FOH 46b04(b).  Additionally, if an
employer does not comply with 20 CFR § 655.22(n) and willfully places workers
outside the area of intended employment or in occupations not certified on the ETA
Form 9142, the employer is still obligated to pay the higher of the rate listed
on the 9142 or the prevailing wage in the location or occupation where the
employee is actually working.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Satisfaction of
wage obligation. Except as discussed below, the H-2B worker must be paid
his/her wages, free and clear, when due at the end of the pay period in which
the hours of work are performed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   Facilities
furnished to H-2B workers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Deductions must be
specified in the H-2B job offer, and all deductions must be reasonable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  An employer may take
a “wage credit” (i.e., may reduce or make a deduction from the cash payment of
the required/offered wage) for facilities that are primarily for the benefit of
the H-2B worker.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Housing and food allowances
are generally considered to be for the primary benefit of the worker.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  The wage credit
(deduction) for facilities cannot exceed the fair market value or the actual
cost to the employer of the facility (whichever is lower) and must be
documented by the H-2B employer. See 29 CFR Part 531.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>46c01 - Deductions.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   “Deduction”
means any amount by which the H-2B worker’s cash wages are decreased. A
deduction may be shown on the payroll records, marked as a deduction or a wage
credit (e.g., FICA, housing). However, a deduction will also be considered to
exist where the H-2B worker’s cash wages have been decreased through
out-of-pocket expenditures made by the H-2B worker for business expenses of the
H-2B employer incurred in obtaining the worker's H-2B status. Such expenses
include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Attorney's or agent's
fees incurred for any activity related to the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification or petition filing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Recruitment costs,
including the cost of advertising or payment to a foreign or domestic
recruitment service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  A discussion of the
FLSA’s impact on visa fees and inbound and outbound transportation for H-2B
workers is set forth in FOH 46c01(f) and 46c02.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   A wage
violation will exist where a deduction causes the cash wage to fall below the
required wage, unless the deduction is made in accordance with the H-2B
regulations. If the H-2B worker receives the required wage despite the
deduction, there is no violation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   The employer
must make all deductions from the worker's wages that are required by law (e.g.,
income tax and FICA).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(d)   The H-2B
employer may make deductions not required by law if such deductions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Are specified in the
job offer,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Are reasonable (the
employer may not profit from the deduction), and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Do not violate federal,
state, or local law.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   Fees paid to
USCIS when filing a Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (Form I-129) may not be
deducted to the extent they reduce the worker's wages to below the required
wage. Such fees include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  A basic filing fee of
$320.00,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  An additional premium
processing fee of $1,000.00 if expedited processing is requested, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  A “fraud prevention
and detection fee” of $150.00 mandated by the Save Our Small and Seasonal
Business Act of 2005 (SOBA) to be paid by all H-2B petitioning employers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(f)   The statute
requires that the employer pay the reasonable cost of the H-2B's return
transportation to his/her last place of residence abroad if the employer
terminates the worker prior to the end of the approved status. See 8 USC
1184(c)(5).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>46c02 - Effect of the FLSA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   The H-2B
regulations allow employers to receive reimbursement for certain specific
costs, including government required passport and visa fees. Under the FLSA,
visa fees are an employer business expense. Consequently, H-2B employers that
are covered under the FLSA may not make deductions that would bring the
employee below the FLSA minimum wage. See 20 CFR 655.22(g), see also Field
Assistance Bulletin 2009-2 available at:  http://www.dol.gov/whd/FieldBulletins/FieldAssistanceBulletin2009_2.htm</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   FLSA Minimum
Wage.  Under the FLSA, the employer is liable for the inbound transportation of
the H-2B worker and the outbound transportation when the worker's H-2B status
has ended. If failure to pay such transportation costs results in a failure to
pay the FLSA minimum wage in a non-overtime initial or terminal workweek or the
regular rate in an overtime workweek, there is an FLSA wage violation for the
affected initial or terminal workweek(s). See Field Assistance Bulletin 2009-2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   FLSA Overtime
(OT) Pay. Where the FLSA OT requirement is applicable, the 40-hour workweek/time-and-one-half
standard will be used to determine whether the worker has been properly paid. Premium
pay is based on the H-2B employee's regular rate of pay, which can be no less
than the required/offered wage.</p>

<h3>46d00 - Authority of WHD.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Pursuant to the delegation
of authority from the Secretary of Homeland Security to the Secretary of Labor,
the WHD will, either pursuant to a complaint or otherwise, conduct
investigations to determine compliance with the H-2B requirements. In
connection with such investigations, WHD may enter any places, inspect any
records (and make transcriptions and copies thereof), question persons, and
gather any information deemed necessary to determine the status of compliance. See
20 CFR 655.50(a) &amp; (b).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>46d01 - Employer cooperation.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>An employer shall, at all
times, cooperate in administrative and enforcement proceedings. See 20 CFR
655.50(c). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(a)   An employer
being investigated shall make available to the WHI: records, information,
persons and places as deemed appropriate to copy, transcribe, question, or
inspect.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(b)   Where the
records are maintained at the central recordkeeping office, other than the
place or places of employment, such records must be made available for
inspection and copying within 72 hours following notice from the WHI.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(c)   H-2B employers
are required to develop and maintain certain employment records to support
their compliance with the attestations made on the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification. These records include those specifically required by
the H-2B program as well as those required by the FLSA for covered employers,
including the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1)  Temporary need. See 20
CFR 655.6(e).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2)  Determination of the
prevailing wage. See 20 CFR 655.10(i).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3)  Pre-filing
recruitment, including newspaper advertisements. See 20 CFR 655.1.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4)  Recruitment report
and evidence of U.S. worker referrals. See 20 CFR 655.16(j).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(5)  Supporting evidence
for temporary need. See 20 CFR 655.21(c).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These records must be kept
for a period of no less than three years from the date of certification or from
the date of determination if the Application for Temporary Employment
Certification is denied or withdrawn, so they are available in the event they
are requested in an ETA request for further information (RFI) or audit, or a
WHD investigation.</p>
<p>(d)   No employer or
representative or agent of an employer shall interfere with any official of DOL
who is performing an investigation, inspection, or law enforcement function.
Any such interference shall be a violation of the Application for Temporary
Employment Certification and regulations. See 20 CFR 655.50(c).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(e)   The WHD shall,
to the extent possible under existing law, protect the confidentiality of any
person who provides information in the course of an investigation. See 20 CFR 655.50(d).
