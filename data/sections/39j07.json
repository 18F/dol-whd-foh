  "text": "Under the FMLA, an\nemployee may not be required to accept a light duty position or a reasonable\naccommodation in lieu of taking FMLA leave.  However, the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (ADA) may require the employer to offer the employee the\nopportunity to take such a position. (a)   While an\nemployee cannot be required to accept a light duty position, the FMLA does not\nprevent an employee from accepting, voluntarily and without coercion, a light\nduty position while recovering from a serious health condition.  If an employee\nvoluntarily accepts a light duty position, that employee retains the right\nunder the FMLA to be restored to the same or equivalent position that the\nemployee had when the employee’s FMLA leave began.  This right to restoration\nceases at the end of the applicable 12-month FMLA leave year.  The time\nemployed in the light duty position will not count against the employee’s FMLA\nentitlement. (b)   If an\nemployee is on FMLA leave concurrently with a worker’s compensation absence and\nthe employee’s health care provider certifies that the employee is able to\nreturn to work in a light duty position and the employer offers the employee\nsuch a position, the employee is not required under the FMLA to accept it. \nHowever, if the employee refuses the light duty position, he or she may lose his\nor her workers’ compensation benefits.  In such a situation, the employee\nretains the right to continue on protected leave under the FMLA until the\nemployee can return to his or her position or the FMLA entitlement is\nexhausted. (c)   Whenever\nan employee performs his or her own job for less than a full schedule, the\nemployee is using intermittent or reduced schedule leave and is not performing\nlight duty for purposes of the FMLA.  However, if the employee has already used\nhis or her full entitlement in a 12-month period and then voluntarily accepts a\nlight duty position, that employee no longer has a right under the FMLA to\nrestoration. 29 CFR 825.207(e),\n825.220(d), 825.702(d)(2)73 FR 67934, 67989",
