  "text": "(a)   In order for a pension plan or a profit sharing plan\nproviding for pension benefits to be creditable towards meeting the prevailing\nwage requirements of DBRA, the contributions must be irrevocably made to a\ntrustee or a third party as set forth in 29 CFR §§ 5.26 and 5.27. In accordance\nwith 29 CFR § 5.26, the trustees must assume the usual fiduciary\nresponsibilities imposed upon trustees by applicable law. However, there is no\nprohibition against the contractor being a trustee of a plan. (b)  As a general rule, contributions to profit sharing\nplans providing pension benefits may not be creditable towards meeting a\ncontractor’s or subcontractor’s prevailing wage obligation because of the\nuncertainty or discretionary nature of the contribution provisions of the plan. Since by its nature a profit\nsharing plan is only operative if there are profits, there is no guarantee that\nany contributions will be made on behalf of an employee. In addition, since\ncontributions under such plans are normally made on an annual basis, they fail\nto meet the requirement that plan contributions be made not less often than\nquarterly. (29 CFR § 5.5 (a)(l)(i).)(c)   However, credit for profit sharing that funds pension\nbenefit plans can be given if certain conditions are met. The contractor would\nbe required to contribute irrevocably to an escrow account not less often than\nquarterly, during the period of the DBRA covered work, an amount sufficient to\nmeet any claimed fringe benefit credit under DBRA for pensions on behalf of\neach employee participating in the plan. Upon the annual determination of\nprofits, the monies placed in escrow are transferred to the pension trust fund\nand used as an offset against the contractor’s obligation to employees under\nthe profit sharing plan. Allowable credit under DBRA would be limited to the\ncontributions made which cover that portion of the total hours worked by the\nemployees during the year which is attributable to work covered by DBRA Any\nshortfall in profits which results in actual payments to the pension plan being\nless than the rate at which the contractor claimed DBRA credit throughout the\nyear would have to be made up by the contractor when the account is settled at\nyear end, by paying the difference (shortfall) in cash directly to the\nemployees, or by making additional contributions to the pension fund in an\namount to cover the shortfall. A contractor cannot claim credit for more than\nthe actual costs of, or payments made into, the plan. (d)  “Vesting” is a usual provision of a pension plan which\nrequires that an employee must work a specified period of time before he has\nearned the right to the pension benefits provided in the plan. It is WHD’s\nposition that such provisions are permissible under the Act if they meet the\nrequirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). (e)   “Forfeitures” are fringe benefit monies which have\nbeen contributed on behalf of terminated, nonvested participants who have been\nterminated prior to having “vested” in the plan. Pension and profit sharing\nplans normally contain provisions for the disposition of forfeitures. Such\nprovisions provide that forfeitures are to be used to reduce a contractor’s\nfuture contributions or are allocated to the remaining employees’ accounts. In\neither case, such provisions are not prohibited under the Davis-Bacon Act.\nHowever, the contractor may not use such forfeitures as a credit toward meeting\nthe requirements of an applicable Davis-Bacon wage determination. To do so\nwould allow the contractor to take double credit for the same contributions. (f)     (1) \nFor defined contribution pension\nplans that provide for a higher hourly rate of contributions to be made for DBRA\nwork than for noncovered work, the higher rate paid for DBRA work will be fully\ncredited only if the plan provides for immediate participation and immediate or\nessentially immediate vesting schedules (e.g., 100% vesting after an employee\nworks 500 or fewer hours). In addition, if the employer wishes the plan to\nqualify for tax exempt status, the amount of annual contributions may not\nexceed a limitation imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. (2) \nFor all defined benefit pension\nplans and defined contribution pension plans which do not provide for immediate\nor essentially immediate vesting schedules (100% vesting after an employee works\n500 or fewer hours), Davis-Bacon credit for contributions made to the plan is\nallowed based on the effective annual rate of contributions for all hours\nworked during the year. In other words, if a contractor wishes to receive $2.00\nper hour credit for pension plan contributions, the contractor must contribute\nat this same rate for all hours worked during the year. If this is not done,\nthe credit for DBRA purposes would have to be revised accordingly. (3) \nFor example, assume that a firm’s\ncontributions for the pension benefit were computed to be $2,000.00 a year for\na particular employee. If that employee worked 1,500 hours of the year on a\nDBRA covered project and 500 hours of the year on another job not covered by\nDBRA, only $1500 or $1.00 per hour would be creditable towards meeting the\nfirm’s obligation to pay the prevailing wage on the DBRA project This method\nfor determining the allowable D-B credit for fringe benefit payments results\nfrom the fact that employers are prohibited from using contributions made for\nwork covered by DBRA to fund the plan for periods of non-DBRA work, except as\nstated in (g)(2) above.",
