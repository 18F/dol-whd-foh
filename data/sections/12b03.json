  "text": "Employees will be considered to be handling, selling or otherwise\nworking on “goods or materials” that have been moved in or produced for\ncommerce by any person within the meaning of Sec 3(s), if what they are\nhandling, selling, or working on constitutes “goods or materials” which have\nbeen so moved or produced. “Goods” are defined in Sec 3(i) of the Act. The fact\nthat the interstate movement of the goods or materials handled or worked on by\nthe employees does not begin until after, or has ended before, their work is\nperformed can provide no basis for concluding that their activities do not\nrelate to “goods or materials” within the meaning of Sec 3(s). Congress has\nspecifically recognized that demand for a product affects interstate inflow of\n“goods or materials” quite as surely as production for commerce affects\noutflow. Thus the language “goods or materials”, as used in Sec 3(s), includes\ntrucks, equipment, replacement parts, supplies, stock-in-trade, finished or raw\nmaterials and other “goods or materials” that have been moved in or produced\nfor commerce.",
