  "text": "(a)   The garnishment restrictions apply in all weeks,\nwhether an employee has worked a full or partial week. Although the unpaid\ndisposable earnings for a partial w/w are subject to garnishment, withholding\nfor a consumer debt garnishment is permitted only if the employee’s disposable\nearnings are in excess of the restriction of sec 303(a)(2), currently $154.50\n(30 X $5.15). (See FOH 16b00(a).) (b)  The following example takes place in a state where a garnishment\nwrit can only capture the earnings actually earned up to the time of service.\nThe employer of a debtor pays on a weekly basis. The w/w runs from Sunday\nthrough Saturday and payday is Thursday. The employer is served with a consumer\ndebt garnishment on Wednesday. The employee earned $250.00 in disposable\nearnings in the preceding w/w, and $150.00 in the current one. The amount that may\nbe garnished, under the provisions of sec 303(a), is computed as follows: \n \n  \n  Period\n  \n  \n  Earnings\n  Amount\n  \n  \n  Amount\n  Garnishable\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  Preceding\n  w/w\n  \n  \n  $250.00 x\n  25 % (Disposable earnings > $206.00) =\n  \n  \n  $62.50\n  \n \n \n  \n  Current\n  w/w\n  \n  \n  $150.00\n  (Disposable earnings < $154.50) =\n  \n  \n  $0.00\n  \n \n \n  \n  Total Garnishable\n  \n  \n  $62.50\n  \n \n If withholding for the\ncurrent w/w is required under another garnishment order served at the end of\nthe week, the employer will recompute the garnishment based on the employee’s earnings\nfor the entire week. (c)   Under sec 303(a)(2), the floor for disposable earnings\nexempt from garnishment is determined based on the length of the pay period.\nThis pay period restriction is not prorated or reduced in the case of earnings\nfor partial pay periods or pay periods of less than a week. This floor does not\napply to child support or alimony garnishments (See FOH 16b00(b)), or federal\nor state tax or personal bankruptcy garnishments. (See FOH16b00(c).)",
