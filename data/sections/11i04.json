  "section_title": "11i04 - Installation and\nservice employees: individual coverage of employees installing equipment,\nmachinery, or other apparatus distinguished from local activities such as\nconstruction.",
  "text": "(a)   Employees who engage in the installation of apparatus,\nequipment, machinery, and similar goods which are still moving in interstate\ncommerce are individually covered. Whether such goods remain in commerce during\nthe installation process is determined by both the nature of the contract of\nsale and by the character of the installation activities. If there is primarily\na contract for work to be performed and the sale of the goods is incidental\nthereto, the installation is considered to be predominantly of a local nature\nand individual coverage will not apply. On the other hand, if the contract is\nprimarily a sale of the goods, individual coverage will apply where it is\ndetermined that the installation activities are a necessary incident to the\nsale. In making the latter determination, consideration shall be given to: (1)  whether the performance of the installation work is\nessential to the complete delivery in interstate commerce because of complexity\ninherent in the product; or (2)  whether the installation work is inherently intrastate\nin character and reasonably separable from the interstate features of the sale. If\ndelivery to the customer and installation are accomplished in what practically\namounts to a single operation, the goods would retain their character as goods\nin commerce until installation has been completed. (b)   in applying the principles set out in (a) above, the\ninstallation of the goods considered therein shall be distinguished from the\nerection of construction materials. (See FOH 11c10.) (c)   In addition to other bases of coverage, installation\nor service employees may likewise be individually covered where the\ninstallation or service is the repair, maintenance, extension, or\nreconstruction of movable or fixed facilities or channels of interstate\ncommerce, or of machinery or premises used in the production of goods for\ninterstate commerce.",
