Any community action\nagency which is an entity of a State, a political subdivision of a State, or a\ncombination of public agencies is clearly an employer covered under the Act.\n(See Secs 3(d) and 3(x) and FOH 10c05.) (2)          \nHowever, a community action agency which consists solely of a\nprivate nonprofit agency or organization that has been designated by the State\n(or political subdivision thereof) would not thereby become a “public agency”.\nThis does not, of course, preclude coverage of such private community action\nagency under another provision of the FLSA. A private community action agency\ndoes not become a “public agency” merely because it receives and disburses\nFederal funds. However, see FOH 59d. (b)           \nEnterprise coverage. Enterprise\ncoverage does not apply to the charitable, educational, religious or similar\nactivities of private nonprofit organizations except where such activities are\nperformed in connection with the type of institution set out in Sec 3(s)(1) of\nthe Act or in connection with commercial ventures. (c)           \n“Individual” coverage. Individual\ncoverage may apply to employees of such organizations.",
