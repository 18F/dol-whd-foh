  "text": "(a)   Individual coverage of building maintenance and\ncustodial employees (boiler firemen, building engineers, electricians,\npainters, janitors, elevator operators and the like), is to be determined in\naccordance with the principles stated in (b) through (d) below. (b)   A maintenance or custodial employee serving the\nbuilding or any part of it is individually covered if he or she is regularly\nand recurringly engaged in such activities as ordering or receiving goods from\noutside the State, handling or otherwise “producing” goods for shipment to\nother States, keeping records relative to interstate transactions, or using the\ntelephone or the mails for interstate communication. Individual coverage on\nthis basis may arise from a variety of activities. For example, a building\nswitchboard operator would be individually covered if he or she regularly and\nrecurringly handles interstate telephone calls for tenants. Likewise, a porter\nor elevator operator who regularly and recurringly handles interstate freight\nand packages for tenants would be individually covered. Moreover, an elevator\noperator is individually covered if letter carriers and parcel post conveyers\nregularly and recurringly ride the elevator he or she operates to make\ndeliveries of letters and parcels which have moved in interstate commerce. (c)   A building maintenance or custodial employee will be\nconsidered to be individually covered if as a regular and recurring part of\ntheir duties they serve those portions of the building occupied by a tenant\nengaged in that location in interstate commerce or the production of goods for\ninterstate commerce. Such an employee will be individually covered, as if he or\nshe were employed by the tenant himself to perform the covered work. For\nexample, a janitor would be covered if as a part of their duties they regularly\nand recurringly clean those portions of the building occupied by an interstate\ninsurance firm or a bank (thereby being engaged in the insurance firm’s or\nbank’s production of goods for interstate commerce). Likewise, a janitor would\nbe covered if as a part of their duties they regularly and recurringly clean\nthose portions of a building occupied by a radio or TV station engaged in\ninterstate communications. In applying these principles to any employee the\nelement of substantiality must be taken into consideration. For example, a\njanitor would not be considered covered  solely on the basis of taking a few\nminutes each day to empty waste baskets in an “interstate” insurance office, or\nbecause, on occasion, called upon outside their regular duties to perform some\nincidental cleaning task in a bank. Nor would the performance of maintenance or\ncustodial services in those portions of the building occupied by an\n“essentially local” business provide a basis of coverage, if the same work\nwould not provide a basis of coverage for a worker employed by such a tenant.\nCases where coverage is questionable will be submitted through channels to the\nRS for opinion, including all cases where compliance depends on the application\nof these principles to custodial employees who clean only the halls and\ncorridors outside the portions of the building occupied by “interstate”\ntenants, or building engineers whose duties relate to the building in general\n(heating air-conditioning, etc.). (d)   Without regard to any other basis of coverage,\nmaintenance and custodial employees are covered on an individual basis if the\nbuilding for which they perform these functions is devoted to interstate\ncommerce or to the production of goods for interstate commerce to such a\nsubstantial extent that there may be said to be a “close and immediate tie”\nbetween the activities of such employees and the interstate commerce or\nproduction involved. On this basis the Act has been held to cover all building\nmaintenance and custodial employees in loft buildings where goods are\nphysically produced for interstate commerce, in headquarters buildings of\ncompanies engaged elsewhere in producing goods for interstate commerce, in\nbuildings substantially devoted to interstate operations of insurance companies\nor government agencies, and in multi-tenant office or other buildings in which\noccupants engaged in actual production of goods for commerce on the premises\nutilize a substantial portion of the rentable areas for their operations.\nBuilding maintenance and custodial employees are not individually covered by\nthe Act solely by reason of the fact that they service buildings operated as a\nlocal activity not dedicated in any way to interstate commerce or to the\nproduction of goods for such commerce, which are held out for tenancy by and\nare in fact tenanted by the “usual miscellany” of offices, in which no\nmanufacturing is carried on. In determining whether or not the building as a\nwhole is so maintained and operated as to have a “close and immediate tie” to\ninterstate commerce or the production of goods for interstate commerce, it is\nnot possible to establish precise mathematical formulas based either on the\npercentage of rentable space occupied by specific types of tenants or the\nextent of commerce or production conducted on the premises. It is necessary to\nlook at the building as a whole and at the business operations conducted on the\npremises by its tenants. Where compliance depends upon such a determination,\nthe following procedure shall be followed: (1)  If at least half of the rentable area of the building\nis occupied by tenants substantially engaged on the premises in interstate\ncommerce or the production of goods for interstate commerce, the building as a\nwhole shall be considered as maintained and operated as an instrumentality of\ninterstate commerce or an interstate production facility (i.e., there is the\n“close and immediate tie”) and all maintenance and custodial employees shall be\nconsidered to be individually covered. (This would clearly apply, for example,\nwhere at lease half of the rentable area is occupied by such tenants as an\ninterstate insurance company or a bank, or some combination of such tenants.) (2)  If less than half of the rentable area is occupied by\nsuch tenants, the facts shall be obtained and the matter shall be referred\nthrough channels to the RS for opinion. In developing the necessary\ninformation, the approximate rentable area of the building, the types of\ntenants, and the business operations conducted by the tenants with particular\nreference to whether or not the Inv considers them to fall into the\n“interstate” or the “usual miscellany” category shall be included. This\ninformation can be shown by chart or in any appropriate manner with such\nexplanations as are required. For example, the percentage of rentable area\noccupied by “interstate” tenants such as banks, insurance firms, Federal\nagencies, manufacturers, and radio and TV stations can be shown in one column;\nthe percentage of rentable area occupied by the “usual miscellany” of local\ntenants such as lawyers, doctors, and real estate agents in another column (e)   The principles stated above do not apply to building\nmaintenance and custodial employees employed by a shopping center which is\ncomposed of individual buildings contiguously located for convenience, having\nonly party walls as a common ground between tenants. However, such employees\nmay otherwise be individually covered. (f)   In some cases, employees may be engaged to perform\nonly activities such as cleaning, waxing, and buffing floors, as opposed to\ngeneral janitorial services work. For purposes of individual coverage, such\nemployees are held in the same light as employees performing general janitorial\nservice work notwithstanding that their work contributes to the operations of\nthe customers’ buildings only from an aesthetic point of view and that the\nfinish on the floor has little preservative effect and does not add\nsignificantly to the wearability of the floor. Thus, such employees are\nconsidered to be individually covered in any w/w in which they perform such\nduties in truck terminals, banks, factories producing goods for commerce, etc.\nThe activities of these employees are distinguished from the activities of\nwindow washers, landscapers or exterminators.
