  "text": "(a)   The CWHSSA provides in part that the Act applies if\nthe contract is “for work financed in whole or in part by loans or grants from,\nor loans insured or guaranteed by,\" the United States or any agency or\ninstrumentality thereof under any federal law providing wage standards for the\nwork. 40 U.S.C. § 3701(b)1(B)(iii). Thus, coverage on Federally assisted contracts\ndoes not exist unless the particular statute under which the loans or grants\nare authorized contains wage standards, directly or by reference. For example,\ncontracts awarded as a result of a grant from the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture, Soil Conservation Service, under the Watershed Protection and\nFlood Prevention Act (16 USCA § 1001, et seq.) are not covered by CWHSSA since\nthe basic statute contains no reference to wage standards. (b)  40 U.S.C. §3701) also provides that 40 U.S.C. §3702 (labor\nstandards and wage and liquidated damages liabilities) shall not apply “to work\nwhere the assistance described in [40 U.S.C. § 3701(b)1(B)(iii)] from the Government\nor an agency or instrumentality is only in a loan guarantee, or insurance”.\n(Emphasis added.) This is a limited partial exemption from the application of\nCWHSSA confined to work assisted only in the quoted manner. It applies even\nthough CWHSSA stipulations are written into the contract, but it does not\naffect DBRA application under the wage standards provided in the enabling\nstatute. Particular attention should be paid to Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment projects since the assistance for many of these projects is only in\nthe nature of a loan guarantee, or insurance. (c)   With respect to contracts involving transportation, it\nis necessary to distinguish carefully as to whether the contract is primarily\nfor transportation purposes or whether the transportation is merely incidental\nto some other purpose of the contract. For example, mail haul contracts are for\nthe primary purpose of transportation; hauling of materials by a contractor in\nconnection with its construction contract is an incident to the primary purpose\nof the contract, which is construction, not transportation. (d)  The “open market” exemption in CWHSSA is much broader\nthan the exemption in PCA. While in PCA the “open market” exemption is directed\nat the mode of purchase, in the CWHSSA the determination of whether a purchase\nis an “open market” one depends on the character of the products or article\npurchased. If the contract is for the purchase of materials in the form in\nwhich they are ordinarily made available to the general purchasing public, the\nCWHSSA “open market” exemption applies. (e)   Laborers or mechanics (including “watchmen” and\nguards) engaged in performance of government contracts for supplies that are\nnot ordinarily available in the “open market” (see (d) above) are covered by\nCWHSSA if and to the extent that the work which they perform is not required to\nbe done in accordance with the provisions of PCA. If a contract in excess of\n$100,000 is in part for services and in part for materials, a laborer or\nmechanic performing the services may be subject to CWHSSA, and another\nemployee, engaged in producing the materials, may be subject only to PCA.",
