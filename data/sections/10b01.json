  "text": "The courts\nhave made it clear that the employment relationship under the FLSA is broader\nthan the traditional common law concept of the master and servant relationship.\nThe difference between the FLSA employment relationship and the common law\nemployment relationship arises from the FLSA statement that “Employ includes to\nsuffer or permit to work”. The courts have indicated that, while “to permit”\nrequires a more positive action than “to suffer”, both terms imply much less\npositive action than required by the common law. Mere knowledge by an employer\nof work done for him or her by another is sufficient to create the employment\nrelationship under the FLSA.",
