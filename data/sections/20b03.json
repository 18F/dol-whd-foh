  "text": "(a)  \nThe stripping of\ntobacco in an independent warehouse that prepares the crop for market is not a\npractice performed \"by a farmer\" if performed by employees of the\nwarehouse, even though the warehouse employs as strippers, the farmers who grew\nthe tobacco. In a situation where tobacco farmers and their tenants exchange\nservices in stripping tobacco grown by them, careful examination of the\narrangement is necessary to determine whether the strippers: (1) \nAre individually\nemployed in turn by each farmer (in which event they would be considered as\nemployed in \"agriculture\", if the stripping performed for each farmer\nis a subordinate part of his activities), or (2) \nAre employed by\nthe warehouse (in which event the stripping is not performed \"by a\nfarmer\"), or  (3) \nAre jointly\nemployed by the several farmers (in which event it cannot be said that the\nstripping is incidental to any particular farmer’s farming operations, and they\nwould not be considered as employed in \"agriculture\"). (4) \nHowever, see Sec\n7(m) and FOH Secs 20i00, 20t00, and 20t01.",
