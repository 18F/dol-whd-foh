  "text": "(a)           \n29 CFR 570.33(h) prohibits 14- and\n15-year-olds from performing all baking activities.   (1)          \nUnder CL Reg 3, baking is a\n“process” and prohibited activities include such things as the weighing,\nmeasuring, and mixing of ingredients; placing or assembling products in pans or\non trays; operating ovens (including placing items in ovens and removing items\nfrom ovens); placing items on cooling trays or racks; and finishing or icing\nbaked products (see 69 FR 75383, December 16, 2004, for more\ninformation).  (2)          \nThis prohibition on performing\nactivities that are steps in the baking process precludes 14- and 15-year-olds\nfrom assembling pizzas just prior to baking.  This is true even if older workers\nwill actually place the pizzas in the ovens and remove them from the ovens. (b)           \nThe ban on baking precludes 14-\nand 15-year-olds from operating almost all ovens, including convection ovens,\nmicrowave ovens (except those used for warming foods as described in\nFOH 33c10(b)(2), below), pizza ovens, automatic feeding ovens, and high\nspeed ovens. (1)          \nHigh speed ovens.  Fourteen and\nfifteen year olds are prohibited from cooking or baking with high speed ovens\nthat operate using a combination of high speed air impingement, infrared\nbrowning elements, microwaves, and catalytic converters.  These ovens, which\ncan operate at temperatures of 500 °F, can quickly cook a wide variety of food\nitems. a.             \nThese ovens, including models\nmanufactured by TurboChef called the Tornado, the C3, and the High h Batch, are\noften used by quick service restaurants to bake or “toast” submarine sandwiches\nand pizzas. b.             \nSuch equipment may not be\nconsidered a “toaster” that would be permitted under 29 CFR 570.34(i) (see FOH\n33c12(b)(2)). c.             \nEnforcement experience indicates\nthat these high speed ovens are used in a variety of food service\nestablishments, hotels and theaters.   (2)          \nMicrowave ovens.  Fourteen- and\n15-year-olds may operate microwave ovens that, in accordance with § 570.34(i),\nare used only to warm prepared food and do not have the capacity to work above\n140 °F.",
