Where such instruments are transmitted\ndirectly or indirectly out of the State, the employees so engaged are engaged\nin the production of goods for interstate commerce. (c)   Those whose clerical activities directly relate to the\npreparation, execution, and validation of the instruments mentioned above, and\nthose who prepare letters, documents, pamphlets, papers, and other records\npertaining to the interstate activity of the institution are subject to the\nFLSA because they are producing goods for interstate commerce.
