  "text": "(a)   Pay\nincreases or changes (1)  An employee is\nentitled to any unconditional pay increase which may have occurred during the\nFMLA leave period, such as cost of living increases.  An employee is also\nentitled to be restored to a position with the same or equivalent pay premiums,\nsuch as a shift differential. (2)  Pay increases\nbased on seniority, length of service, or work performed must be applied\naccording to the employer’s policy for other employees on an equivalent leave\nstatus for a non-FMLA reason. (b)   Bonuses (1)  Equivalent pay\nincludes any bonus or payment, whether it is discretionary or\nnon-discretionary. (2)  If a bonus is\nbased on the achievement of a specified goal (hours worked, products sold, perfect\nattendance, etc.) and the employee has not met the goal due to FMLA leave, the\npayment may be denied unless the employer pays such a bonus to other employees\non an equivalent leave status for non-FMLA reasons. For example, if an employer policy does not\ndisallow an attendance bonus to an employee who takes vacation leave, the\nemployer cannot deny the bonus to an employee who takes vacation leave for an\nFMLA purpose (i.e., substitutes paid vacation leave for FMLA leave).  However,\nif an employer does not count vacation leave against an attendance bonus but\ndoes count unpaid leave against the bonus, the employer may deny the bonus to\nan employee who takes 12 weeks of FMLA leave, two weeks of which the employee\nsubstituted paid vacation leave, but ten of which the employee takes as unpaid\nFMLA leave. Penalizing an employee for taking FMLA leave\nunder a no-fault attendance policy is distinct from disqualifying an employee\nfrom a bonus or award for attendance because the former faults an employee for\ntaking leave and the latter denies a reward for achieving the job-related\nperformance goal of perfect attendance. 73 FR 67934, 67985 29 CFR 825.215(c)",
