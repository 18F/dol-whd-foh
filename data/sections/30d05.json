  "text": "(a)   Where\ntips are charged on credit cards, WH will not question the reduction of the\ncredit card tips paid over to the employee if the amount deducted is no greater\nthan the percentage charged by the credit card company.  For example, where a\ncredit card company charges an employer 5 percent on all sales charged to its\ncredit service, the employer may pay the employee 95 percent of the tips\nwithout violating FLSA. (b)   Payment\nof both MW and OT compensation, including the charged tips, due to a “tipped\nemployee” must ordinarily be made at the regular payday for the w/w, or when\nthe pay period covers more than a single w/w, at the regular payday for the\nperiod in which the particular w/w ends (see FOH 30b04).  The procedures\nrequired to process charges made by customers through credit cards may delay\nactual receipt of the funds by the employer for one or two months. \nNevertheless, the employer is required to pay over the charged tips to the\nemployee on the employee’s next regular payday. (c)   In some\nsituations, a credit card transaction is not collected from a credit card\ncompany.  In such cases, the employer is not required to pay a tipped employee\nthe amount of tips specified on the credit card slip.  Of course, this assumes\nthe inability to collect is not a result of the employer’s failure to submit\nthe slip for reimbursement, etc. (d)   The\nemployer may recover from a tipped employee the tip amount stated on the\nuncollected credit card slip if the tip amount has been paid to the tipped\nemployee.  This may be accomplished either by payroll deduction or by\nout-of-pocket reimbursement by the employee to the employer.  Regardless of how\neffectuated, the recovery of the tips should be accurately documented by the\nemployer.  However, the amount of uncollected credit card tips which are\nrecovered by the employer must not reduce the tips retained by the tipped\nemployee for the earlier w/w below the claimed tip credit.  The amount of tips\nto be recovered which would cut into the claimed tip credit is unrecoverable by\nthe employer. (e)   Where\nthere are tip pools, tip pool recipients are responsible for reimbursing the\nemployer for the share of tips from an uncollected credit card transaction\nwhich was allocated into the tip pool.  The tipped employee who contributed to\nthe tip pool cannot be held accountable for tips which are not in the\nindividual’s possession.",
