  "text": "(a)   Sec 13(b)(8) of the amended Act, effective 5/1/76,\nprovided a partial OT exemption for: “(A) Any employee\n(other than an employee of a hotel or motel who performs maid or custodial\nservices) who is employed by an establishment which is a hotel, motel, or\nrestaurant and who receives compensation for employment in excess of forty-six\nhours in any workweek at a rate not less than one and one-half times the\nregular rate at which he or she is employed”. ”(B) Any employees of\na hotel or motel who performs maid or custodial services and who receives\ncompensation for employment in excess of forty-four hours in any workweek at a\nrate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he or she\nis employed”. (b)  Effective 5/1/77, maid and custodial workers in hotels\nand motels became entitled to OT compensation after 40 hours in a week; all\nother nonexempt employees in hotels and motels and all nonexempt employees in\nrestaurants remained at a 46 hour week through 1977. (c)   The 1977 Amendments phased out Sec 13(b)(8) in two\nsteps: (1)  Effective 1/1/78, Sec 13(b)(8) is amended by requiring\nOT compensation for hours in excess of 44 per week for employees previously\nlimited to 46 hours; and (2)  Effective 1/1/79, Sec 13(b)(8) is repealed and thus on\nthat date OT is required for hours over 40 per week. (d)  There are no monetary tests which must be met in order\nfor the exemption to apply nor is it necessary that the establishment meet the\ndefinitions of a “retail or service establishment”. The exemption may thus\napply without regard to whether or not the establishment is itself a covered\nSec 3(s) enterprise, or is a part of one. (See IB 779.382, 779.383, 779.386,\nand 779.387.)",
