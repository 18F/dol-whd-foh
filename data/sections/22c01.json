  "text": "(a)  \nAn exempt administrative employee’s primary duty must be\nthe performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management\nor general business operations of the employer or of the employer’s customers.  For\nfurther explanation of the term “primary duty” see the discussion under\n“executive” at FOH 22b01. (b)  \nOffice or non-manual work. The\nadministrative exemption applies only to employees whose primary duty is the\nperformance of office or non-manual work.  Thus, for example, production line\nworkers and employees in maintenance, construction and similar occupations who\nperform work involving repetitive operations with their hands, physical skill\nand energy are not exempt as administrative employees.  For a discussion of\nmanual laborers and other “blue collar” workers outside the scope of the “white\ncollar” exemptions. See 29 CFR § 541.3 and FOH 22a02. (c)  \nDirectly related to management or general business\noperations. The\nphrase “directly related to management or general business operations” refers\nto the type of work performed by the employee.  To meet this requirement, an\nemployee must perform work directly related to assisting with the running or\nservicing of the business, as distinguished, for example, from working on a\nmanufacturing production line or selling a product in a retail or service\nestablishment.  Work “directly related to management or general business\noperations” includes, but is not limited to, work in functional areas such as\ntax, finance, accounting, budgeting, auditing, insurance, quality control,\npurchasing, procurement, advertising, marketing, research, safety and health,\npersonnel management, human resources, employee benefits, labor relations,\npublic relations, government relations, computer network, Internet and database\nadministration, legal and regulatory compliance, and similar activities.  This\nlist is intended only to be illustrative.  It is not intended as a complete\nlisting of exempt areas, nor is it intended as a listing of specific jobs; rather,\nit is a list of functional areas or departments that generally relate to\nmanagement and general business operations of an employer or an employer’s\ncustomers, although each case must be examined individually.  Within such\nareas, it is still necessary to analyze the level or nature of the work\nperformed (i.e., does the employee exercise discretion and independent judgment\nas to matters of significance) in order to determine if the administrative\nexemption applies.  Whether a particular employee primarily performs exempt\nwork depends on the actual duties performed. The\nproduction versus staff dichotomy is a useful analytical tool in evaluating\nwhether an employee’s primary duty is work directly related to management or\ngeneral business operations.  See 69 FR 22140 – 22142.  Courts have noted that\ndetermining whether the administrative exemption applies is not as simple as a\ndrawing the line between “white collar” and “blue collar” employees. Rather,\nnon-manufacturing employees can be considered to be “production” employees if\ntheir job is to generate the product or service that their employer’s business\noffers to the public. The distinction is between those employees whose primary\nduty is administering the business affairs of the enterprise from those whose\nprimary duty is producing the commodity or commodities, whether goods or\nservices, that the enterprise exists to produce and market. (d)  \nEmployer’s customers. An\nemployee may qualify for the administrative exemption if the employee’s primary\nduty is work directly related to the management or general business operations\nof the employer’s customers, rather than those of the employer.  Thus,\nemployees acting as advisors or consultants to their employer’s clients or\ncustomers – such as tax experts or financial consultants, for example - may be\nexempt.  Nothing in 29 CFR part 541 precludes the administrative exemption\nbecause the customer is an individual, rather than a business, as long as the\nwork performed relates to “management or general business operations.”  While\nthe exemption would not apply when the client’s or customer’s “business” is\npurely personal, providing expert advice to a small business owner or a sole\nproprietor regarding management and general business operations would be an\nexempt administrative function.  For example, many bona fide administrative\nemployees perform important functions as advisors or consultants in analyzing\nand recommending changes in business operations but are employed by an entity\nengaged in furnishing such services to others for a fee (e.g., management\nconsultants).  Such employees, if they meet the other requirements of the\nregulations, would qualify for exemption regardless of whether the management\nor general business operations to which their work is directly related are\nthose of the employer’s clients or customers, or those of their employer.  This\nprovision is meant to place administratively exempt work done for a client or\ncustomer on the same footing as such work done for the employer directly,\nregardless of whether the client is a sole proprietor or a “Fortune 500”\ncompany, as long as the work directly relates to “management or general\nbusiness operations.” 69\nFR 22137 through 2214729\nCFR §§ 541.200 - .203, 541.700 WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2002-5 WHD\nLetter FLSA 2005-21NAAdministrator’s\nInterpretation 2010-1",
