Thus for example an employee may be paid a salary intended to compensate\nfor up to 80 hours in a 14 day period in which case his regular rate would be\nobtained by dividing his bi-weekly salary by 80 and he would be due 11/2 times\nthis rate for each OT hour in the 14-day period. (b)   Where a swing shift\nrotation results in an employee working two 8-hour shifts within a 24 hour\nperiod, as defined in IB 778.601(d), the employee would be entitled to receive\nOT compensation at a rate not less than one and one half times his regular rate\nof pay for the hours worked on the second 8-hour shift. This is true\nirrespective of the fact that the second 8-hour work period in the workday is a\nregular part of the 80 hours scheduled biweekly by the hospital or the fact\nthat the second 8-hour shift starts the second 40-hour work period in the\n14-day period. It should be noted that such premium for daily OT may be\ncredited towards OT compensation due for hours in excess of 80 for that period.",
