See 29 CFR § 541.303(d).  In addition, there\nis no minimum educational or academic degree requirement for bona fide teaching\nprofessionals in educational establishments. 29\nCFR § 541.303(d)  (c)  \nExempt teachers include (but are not limited to): regular\nacademic teachers; teachers of kindergarten or nursery school pupils; teachers\nof gifted or disabled children; teachers of skilled and semiskilled trades and\noccupations; teachers engaged in automobile driving instruction; aircraft\nflight instructors; home economics teachers; and vocal or instrumental music\ninstructors.  Faculty members engaged as teachers who also spend a considerable\namount of their time in extracurricular activities such as coaching athletic\nteams or acting as moderators or advisors in such areas as drama, speech, debate\nor journalism are engaged in teaching.  Such extracurricular activities are a\nrecognized part of the schools’ responsibility in contributing to the\neducational development of the student. 29\nCFR § 541.303(b)  (d)  \nPossession of an elementary or secondary teacher’s\ncertificate identifies the individuals who are considered within the scope of\nthe exemption for teaching professionals.  Teachers who possess a teaching\ncertificate qualify for the exemption regardless of the terminology (e.g.,\npermanent, conditional, standard, provisional, temporary, emergency, or\nunlimited) used by the State to refer to different kinds of certificates. \nHowever, private schools and public schools are not uniform in requiring a\ncertificate for employment as an elementary or secondary school teacher, and a\nteacher’s certificate is not generally necessary for employment in institutions\nof higher education or other educational establishments.  Therefore, a teacher\nwho is not certified may be considered for exemption, provided that such\nindividual is employed as a teacher by the employing school or school system. 29\nCFR § 541.303(c)  (e)  \n“The term ‘educational establishment’ means an elementary\nor secondary school system, an institution of higher education or other\neducational institution.  Sections 3(v) and 3(w) of the Act define elementary\nand secondary schools as those day or residential schools that provide\nelementary or secondary education, as determined under State law.  Under the\nlaws of most States, such education includes the curriculums in grades 1\nthrough 12. Under many it includes also the introductory programs in\nkindergarten, and some States may also include nursery school programs in\nelementary education and junior college curriculums in secondary education.  The\nterm ‘other educational establishment’ includes special schools for mentally or\nphysically disabled or gifted children, regardless of any classification of\nsuch schools as elementary, secondary or higher.  Factors relevant in\ndetermining whether post-secondary career programs qualify as educational\ninstitutions include whether the school is licensed by a state agency\nresponsible for the state’s educational system or accredited by a nationally\nrecognized accrediting organization for career schools.  Also, for purposes of\nthe exemption, no distinction is drawn between public and private schools, or\nbetween those operated for profit and those that are not for profit.” 29\nCFR § 541.204(b)  (f)  \nFor employees whose primary duty is performing\nadministrative functions directly related to academic instruction or training\nin an educational establishment.
