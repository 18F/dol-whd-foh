  "text": "(a)   General (1)  Eligible\nemployees who are the spouse, parent, son, daughter, or next of kin of a\ncovered servicemember with a serious injury or illness are entitled to up to 26\nworkweeks of FMLA leave in a “single 12-month period” to care for that covered\nservicemember.  Covered servicemembers include current members of the Regular\nor Reserve components of the Armed Forces and certain veterans. 29 USC 2611(15), 2612(a)(3) Employers were not required to provide military\ncaregiver leave for the care of a veteran until the Department defined a\nqualifying serious injury or illness of a veteran through regulations and those\nregulations became effective.  Regulations defining a qualifying serious injury\nor illness of a veteran became effective on March 8, 2013. 78 FR 884878 FR 8834 A covered servicemember means: a.     Current\nservicemember A current member of\nthe Armed Forces of the United States, including a member of the National Guard\nor Reserves, who has a serious injury or illness for which he or she is\nundergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is in outpatient\nstatus, or is on the temporary disability retired list for a serious injury or\nillness. 29 USC 2611(15)(A)29 CFR 825.127(b)(1) b.     Veteran A veteran who is undergoing\nmedical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a serious injury or illness and\nwho was a member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard\nor Reserves, and was discharged or released under conditions other than\ndishonorable at any time during the period of five years preceding the date on\nwhich the employee first takes leave to care for the veteran (the five-year\nperiod). 1.     Veteran\ndischarged on or after March 8, 2013 For a veteran\ndischarged on or after March 8, 2013, the five-year period for FMLA military\ncaregiver leave begins on the date of discharge. 2.     Veteran\ndischarged between October 28, 2009 and March 8, 2013 For a veteran\ndischarged between October 28, 2009 and March 8, 2013, the five-year period for\nFMLA military caregiver leave begins on [effective date of Final Rule]. 3.     Veteran\ndischarged before October 28, 2009 For a veteran\ndischarged before October 28, 2009 , the period between October 28, 2009 and March\n8, 2013 does not count toward the determination of the five-year period for\ncovered veteran status. In this case, the\nveteran will have the same amount of time available on March 8, 2013 as he or\nshe would have had on October 28, 2009. A.    For\nexample, if a servicemember retired on October 28, 2007, he or she would have\nhad three years remaining of the five-year period on October 28, 2009. \nTherefore, the family member requesting FMLA leave will have three years to\nbegin military caregiver leave starting on March 8, 2013. B.    However,\nif a servicemember was discharged on December 1, 2003, the discharge would have\noccurred more than five years prior to October 28, 2009 and the veteran would\nnot be a covered veteran for military caregiver leave purposes. 29 USC 2611(15)(B)29 CFR 825.127(b)(2) (2)  A serious\ninjury or illness for a covered servicemember is: a.     Current\nservicemember’s serious injury or illness 1.     An\ninjury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that may render\nthe servicemember medically unfit to perform the duties of his or her office,\ngrade, rank, or rating, or 2.     An\ninjury or illness that existed before the beginning of the servicemember’s\nactive duty and was aggravated by service in line of duty on active duty in the\nArmed Forces that may render the member medically unfit to perform the duties\nof his or her office, grade, rank, or rating. 29 USC 2611(18)(A)29 CFR 825.127(c)(1) b.     Veteran’s\nserious injury or illness 1.     An\ninjury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that that\nmanifested itself before or after the servicemember became a veteran and that\nis: A.    A\ncontinuation of a serious injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated\nwhen the veteran was a member of the Armed Forces and rendered the\nservicemember unable to perform the duties of the servicemember’s office,\ngrade, rank, or rating, or B.    A\nphysical or mental condition for which the veteran has received a U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Service-Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50\npercent or greater, and the VASRD rating is based, in whole or in part, on the\ncondition precipitating the need for military caregiver leave, or C.    A\nphysical or mental condition that substantially impairs the veteran’s ability\nto work because of a disability or disabilities related to military service, or\nwould do so absent treatment, or D.    An\ninjury that is the basis for the veteran’s enrollment in the Department of\nVeterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. 2.     An\ninjury or illness that existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty\nand was aggravated by service in line of duty on active duty in the Armed\nForces that otherwise meets any of the definitions in A – D above. 29 USC 2611(18)(B)29 CFR 825.127(c)(2) (3)  26 workweeks of\nleave in a 12-month period a.     The\nsingle 12-month period for military caregiver leave begins on the first day the\nemployee takes FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember and ends 12\nmonths after that date, regardless of the method used by the employer to\ndetermine the employee’s 12 workweeks of leave entitlement for other\nFMLA-qualifying reasons. For example, if an\nemployee first takes military caregiver leave beginning June 1, 2013, the\nemployee’s single 12-month period for military caregiver leave is June 1, 2013\nthrough May 31, 2014, regardless of the fact that the employer may use the\ncalendar year for tracking FMLA leave usage. If an employee does\nnot take all of his or her 26 workweeks to care for a covered servicemember\nduring this single 12-month period, the remaining leave is forfeited. b.     The\nsingle 12-month period is applied on a per-covered servicemember, per-injury\nbasis.  Therefore, an eligible employee may take more than one period of 26\nworkweeks of leave if the leave is to care for a different covered servicemember\nor to care for the same servicemember with a subsequent (different) serious\ninjury or illness.  However, no more than 26 workweeks of leave may be taken\nwithin any single 12-month period. 1.     A\nsubsequent serious injury or illness of the same covered servicemember could\narise either from a different injury or illness incurred by the current\nsevicemember during a subsequent deployment or from a different injury or\nillness that relates back to the initial incident but that manifests at a later\ntime. A.    For\nexample, an eligible employee may take leave in one 12-month period to care for\na servicemember who incurs a traumatic brain injury and take leave in a\nsubsequent 12-month period to care for the same servicemember who returns to\nduty and is injured by an incendiary explosive device. B.    Additionally,\nif a current covered servicemember suffers severe burns in the line of duty, an\neligible employee is entitled to 26 workweeks of military caregiver leave.  If\nthe servicemember later manifests post traumatic stress disorder that was\nincurred in the same incident as the burns, the eligible employee would be\nentitled to an additional 26 workweeks of leave to care for the same\nservicemember. 2.     A\n“current” covered servicemember and a “veteran” covered servicemember will be\nconsidered different covered servicemembers for purposes of the 26 workweeks in\na single 12-month period requirement.  Therefore, an eligible employee could\ntake military caregiver leave to care for a current servicemember who suffered\na burn injury while in active duty service and later take leave to care for the\nsame servicemember for the same injury when the servicemember becomes a veteran. \nAll normal eligibility requirements would apply when the employee seeks\nmilitary caregiver leave to care for the veteran. 29 CFR 825.127(e),\n825.200(b)77 FR 8960, 897073 FR 67934, 6796978 FR 883478 FR 8854 c.     During\nthe single 12-month period the employee can take a combined total of 26\nworkweeks of leave, no more than 12 weeks of which can be for any combination\nof FMLA-qualifying reasons other than military caregiver leave (i.e., leave for\nthe birth or placement of a child, leave due to the serious health condition of\nthe employee or the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent, or leave due\nto a qualifying exigency arising from a military member’s covered active duty\nstatus).  However, the employee’s entitlement to FMLA leave for reasons other\nthan military caregiver leave is limited by his or her prior use of FMLA leave\nduring the applicable 12-month period. 1.     For\nexample, where an employee first takes military caregiver leave beginning June\n1, 2013 and works for an employer who uses the calendar year for tracking FMLA\nleave usage, the employee’s single 12-month period for military caregiver leave\nis June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014.  If the employee had used five weeks of\nFMLA leave between January 1 and June 1, 2013 for a qualifying reason other\nthan military caregiver leave, such as for his own serious health condition, he\nwould only have seven weeks of FMLA leave for a qualifying reason other than\nmilitary caregiver leave available through December 31, 2013.  Once the\nemployee exhausts his 26-workweek entitlement, he may not take any FMLA leave\nfor any reason until the single 12-month period ends. 2.     Thus,\nif the employee used 20 weeks of military caregiver leave from June-December,\n2013, four weeks of leave in January, 2014 for his own serious health\ncondition, and another two weeks of military caregiver leave in March, 2014,\nthe employee will have exhausted his 26-workeek entitlement for the single\n12-month period (June 1, 2013-May 31, 2014).  The employee would still have\neight weeks of FMLA leave for a qualifying reason other than military caregiver\nleave available in calendar year 2014; however, he could not take this leave\nuntil after the single 12-month period ends on May 31, 2014. 29 CFR 825.127(e)73 FR 67934,\n67970-67971 (4)  Qualifying\nleave to care for a family member with a serious health condition Leave that qualifies as both leave to care for\na covered servicemember and leave to care for a family member with a serious\nhealth condition during the single 12-month period must be designated by the\nemployer as leave to care for a covered servicemember.  It cannot be designated\nand counted as leave for both reasons. 28 CFR 825.127(e)(3) (5)  Spouses working\nfor the same employer Spouses employed by the same employer are\nlimited to a combined total of 26 workweeks of leave during the single 12-month\nperiod if the leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember with a serious\ninjury or illness or for a combination of military caregiver leave and leave\nfor the birth of the employee’s son or daughter, placement of a son or daughter\nwith the employee for adoption of foster care, or to care for the employee’s\nparent with a serious health condition.  See FOH 39e03. 29 CFR 825.127(f) (b)   Definitions (1)  Outpatient\nstatus The status of a member of the Armed Forces\nassigned to either a military medical treatment facility as an outpatient or a\nunit established for the purpose of providing command and control of members of\nthe Armed Forces receiving medical care as outpatients. 29 USC 2611(16)29 CFR 825.127(b)(1) (2)  Son or daughter\nof a covered servicemember The covered servicemember’s biological,\nadopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child for whom the\ncovered servicemember stood in loco parentis, and who is of any age. 29 CFR 825.127(d)(1) (3)  Parent of a\ncovered servicemember A covered servicemember’s biological, adoptive,\nstep, or foster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco\nparentis to the covered servicemember.  This does not include parents “in law.” 29 CFR 825.127(d)(2) (4)  Next of kin of\na covered servicemember The covered servicemember’s next of kin is the\nservicemember’s nearest blood relative.  The next of kin is someone other than\nthe servicemember’s spouse, parent, son or daughter, and is determined in the\nfollowing order of priority: a.     Designated\nnext of kin for purposes of military caregiver leave under the FMLA The covered\nservicemember may specifically designate in writing his or her nearest blood\nrelative for purposes of military caregiver leave under the FMLA.  When such\ndesignation has been made, the designated individual is deemed the covered\nservicemember’s only next of kin.  The designated next of kin must be a blood\nrelative of the covered servicemember. b.     Order\nof priority When a servicemember\ndoes not make a designation for purposes of FMLA leave, the next of kin is determined\nin the following order of priority: 1.     Blood\nrelatives who have been granted legal custody of the servicemember by court\ndecree or statutory provisions, 2.     Brothers\nand sisters, 3.     Grandparents, 4.     Aunts\nand uncles, 5.     First\ncousins. When there are\nmultiple family members with the same level of relationship and the covered\nservicemember has not designated a next of kin for FMLA purposes, all such\nfamily members are considered the next of kin and all may take leave to provide\ncare to the covered servicemember, either consecutively or simultaneously. For example, if a\ncovered servicemember has three siblings and has not designated a blood relative\nto provide care for FMLA purposes, all three siblings would be considered the\ncovered servicemember’s next of kin.  Alternatively, where a covered\nservicemember has one or more siblings and designates a cousin as his or her\nnext of kin for FMLA purposes, then only the designated cousin is eligible as\nthe covered servicemember’s next of kin. 29 USC 2611(17)29 CFR 825.127(d)(3)",
