  "text": "(a)   Sec 302(c) defines the term “garnishment” to mean,\n“any legal or equitable procedure through which the earnings of any individual\nare required to be withheld for payment of any debt.” Generally, this\ndefinition refers to a court proceeding. (b)  WH regards a “wage attachment” for state,\nlocal/municipal or federal taxes as a “legal procedure” within the meaning of\nsec 302(c) of the Act. An Internal Revenue Service attachment of wages for\ntaxes due is an example of a wage attachment. This is the case even though\nthere may be no actual court proceeding involved in the tax lien or levy. (See\nFOH 16c01.) Accordingly, such attachments are garnishments for purposes of the\ndischarge restriction in sec 304 of the CCPA. (c)   An “administrative garnishment“ is an amount of money\nwithheld from a private sector employee’s disposable earnings for the payment\nof a non-tax debt owed the federal government. Similar garnishments for federal\nemployees are called “salary offsets.” As used in this chapter, the term\n“administrative garnishment” includes “salary offsets.” Usually, administrative\ngarnishments are instituted for the repayment of loans, such as those granted under\nthe Federal Family Education Loan Program. Administrative garnishments are garnishments\nfor purposes of the CCPA. (1) \nThey are authorized by and subject\nto the terms of the Debt Collection Improvement Act (DCIA), 31 U.S.C. 3720D.\nFor federal employees the terms are set at 5 U.S.C. 5514. These laws generally\nlimit the garnishable amount to fifteen percent of disposable earnings. (See\n(4) below.) (2) \nThe Higher Education Act (HEA)\nauthorizes guaranty agencies for student loans to administratively garnish up\nto 10% of disposable earnings for defaulted student loans. The Department of\nEducation may garnish up to 15% under the DCIA. (3) \nWH has no enforcement authority\nwith respect to such withholdings, provided they are within the CCPA’s limits.\nQuestions over the amount of withholding on an administrative garnishment,\nwhere no CCPA violations are indicated, should be referred to the agency\ninitiating the withholding action. (See FOH 16a0l(b).) (4) \nWhen a debtor agrees in writing to\nallow withholding of an amount greater than the DCIA or HEA limits, the\ndeductions are considered wage assignments. (See (d) below.) (d)  A “wage assignment” is a voluntary transfer of the\nright to receive wages. It is ordinarily a private transaction accomplished\nthrough a contract, without any court compulsion. A wage assignment is not a\ngarnishment within the meaning of the CCPA.",
