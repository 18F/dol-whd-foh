Under the FLSA,\nvisa fees are an employer business expense. Consequently, H-2B employers that\nare covered under the FLSA may not make deductions that would bring the\nemployee below the FLSA minimum wage. See 20 CFR 655.22(g), see also Field\nAssistance Bulletin 2009-2 available at:  http://www.dol.gov/whd/FieldBulletins/FieldAssistanceBulletin2009_2.htm (b)   FLSA Minimum\nWage.  Under the FLSA, the employer is liable for the inbound transportation of\nthe H-2B worker and the outbound transportation when the worker's H-2B status\nhas ended. If failure to pay such transportation costs results in a failure to\npay the FLSA minimum wage in a non-overtime initial or terminal workweek or the\nregular rate in an overtime workweek, there is an FLSA wage violation for the\naffected initial or terminal workweek(s). See Field Assistance Bulletin 2009-2. (c)   FLSA Overtime\n(OT) Pay. Where the FLSA OT requirement is applicable, the 40-hour workweek/time-and-one-half\nstandard will be used to determine whether the worker has been properly paid. Premium\npay is based on the H-2B employee's regular rate of pay, which can be no less\nthan the required/offered wage.",
