Information concerning PWDs may be found at http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/contacts.cfm.\nSee 20 CFR 655.10. (1)  The NPC will enter the\nprevailing wage on the form, indicate the source and validity period, and\nreturn the certified prevailing wage (electronically or by mail) to the employer.\nThe employer must offer this wage (or higher) to both its H‑2B workers and any\nsimilarly employed U.S. workers hired in response to the recruitment required\nas part of the Application for Temporary Employment Certification application. See\n20 CFR 655.10(b)(6). “Similarly employed” means having substantially comparable\njobs in the occupational category in the area of intended employment.

The\nnewspaper must have a reasonable distribution and be appropriate to the\noccupation and the workers likely to apply for the job opportunity. (2)  One of the advertisements\nmust be a Sunday advertisement unless the job opportunity is located in a rural\narea that does not have a newspaper with a Sunday edition; in such a case the\nH-2B employer must, in place of a Sunday edition advertisement, advertise in\nthe regularly published daily edition with the widest circulation in the area\nof intended employment. (3)  If a professional,\ntrade, or ethnic publication is more appropriate than a general circulation\nnewspaper for the occupation or the type of workers likely to apply for the job,\nand it is the source most likely to bring responses from able, available, and\nqualified U.S. workers, the H‑2B employer may use a professional, trade, or\nethnic publication in place of one of the newspaper advertisements, but may not\nto replace the Sunday advertisement. See 20 CFR 655.15 and 655.17 (e)   Union.
