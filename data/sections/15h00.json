The fact that individuals are supplying the\nfunds in payment for services rendered does not preclude coverage. Thus,\ncontracts between Post Exchanges and various concessionaires such as barber\nshops, photographic studios, snack bars, shops repairing shoes, radios,\nwatches, TV sets and appliances, car washing racks, operators of officer clubs,\nand laundry and dry cleaning services, would be subject to CWHSSA. (b)  Where the amount of a contract other than a\nconstruction contract exceeds $100,000, the CWHSSA applies even though the\npercentage paid the Government has the effect of reducing the net amount\nretained by the contractor to a figure of less than $100,000 (for example,\nwhere the contractor pays a post exchange a percentage of the amount collected\nfor cleaning etc, rather than receiving payment from the Government). (See also\nFOH 15i00(7)) (c)   The application of the CWHSSA to concessionaire\ncontracts extends to contracts under which services are provided to the public\ngenerally, and is not limited to those contracts under which services are\nprovided to the Government or its civilian or military personnel. For example,\nall laborers or mechanics employed by concessionaires in national park,\nforests, and the National Wildlife Refuge System, are covered by CWHSSA.",
