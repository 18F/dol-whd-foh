  "text": "(a)  \nThe regular rate for purposes of\nBW computations for OT weeks in which an employee subject to the OT provisions\nof the Acts receive no pay or only part of his pay shall be determined on the\nbasis of the established practice, agreement, or understanding. In the case of\nan employee paid solely on the basis of an hourly rate, this hourly rate shall\nbe the regular rate for purposes of computations during such weeks. Similarly,\nwhere it is determined that the practice or agreement by which an employee’ s\nwages are computed is, for example, an established weekly salary, piece rate or\nday rate, such salary, piece rate or day rate shall be used to compute the\nregular rate. The following examples illustrate the application of this\nprinciple: (1)  An employee works a total of 48 hours in a particular\nweek and receives no pay for that w/w. He regularly receives a weekly salary of\n$96 as ST payment for all hours in a week. For the w/w in question the\nemployee’s regular rate would be $2 an hour ($96 divided by 48 hours). He would\nbe due $2 an hour for the first 40 hours and $3 an hour for each hour over 40\nor a total of $104 for the week. (2)  An employee is paid $1.90 per hour and has 38 recorded\nhours and has received $72.20 but has actually worked 44 hours. He would be due\n$1.90 for the 39th hour, $1.90 for the 40th hour, and $2.85 for each additional\nhour. (b)  \nIf the regular rate cannot be\ndetermined as in (a) above, or if the regular rate so determined is less than\nthe legal minimum, the regular rate for OT purposes shall be the legal minimum\n(see FOH 32j01 and 32j02).",
