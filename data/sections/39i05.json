  "text": "(a)   Group\nhealth plan coverage must be maintained for an employee on FMLA leave until: (1)  The employee\nfails to return from leave or continues on leave after exhausting his or her\nFMLA entitlement, (2)  The employer\ncan show that the employment relationship would have terminated if the employee\nhad not taken FMLA leave, such as if the employee would have been laid off and not\ntransferred to a new position, or (3)  The employee\nprovides unequivocal notice of intent not to return to work. (b)   Additionally,\nunder certain conditions, an employer may end group health plan coverage when\nan employee on FMLA leave fails to submit a required premium payment (see\nFOH 39i06 for details and requirements) or an employee chooses not to\nretain group health coverage during the FMLA leave (see FOH39i02).  All other\nobligations of an employer under the FMLA would continue, such as the\nobligation to reinstate the employee upon return from leave and restoring the\nemployee’s benefits equivalent to those that the employee would have had if the\nemployee had not taken leave. (c)   To\ndiscontinue health benefit coverage under a multi-employer health plan based on\ntermination of the employment relationship, the employer must demonstrate the\nemployee would not have continued to be employed by either the employer or\nanother employer who is a member of the same plan.  For example, if the\nemployee’s construction site is closed but its employees are moved to another\nsite to continue employment for that employer or another member of the plan, it\ncan be assumed that the employee on leave would have continued employment and\ntherefore the employer may not discontinue health benefit coverage. WHD Non-Administrator\nLetter FMLA-14 November 3, 1993 (d)   An\nemployer may cease health benefit coverage when an employee elects to withdraw\nfrom coverage during FMLA leave provided that the decision is truly voluntary\nand future reinstatement would not be barred by the terms of the plan or the\nemployer.  See FOH 39j03. 29 CFR 825.209(f),\n825.211(e), 825.212",
