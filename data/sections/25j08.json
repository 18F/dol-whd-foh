  "text": "(a)  \nTests A and B refer to a calendar\nyear throughout which the operations of the establishment can be tested to\ndetermine its character as a seasonally operated place of business. In the case\nof a new business, Tests A and B are to be applied as follows: (1)  Test A. Generally, Test A is\nnot met by a new business establishment which has operated for no more than 7 months\nin a calendar year for the reason that its business operations did not start\nuntil a considerable portion of the year had elapsed. If, however, the\ncharacter of the establishment is that of an “amusement or recreational\nestablishment, organized camp, or religious or nonprofit educational conference\ncenter” whose operations are shown by acceptable evidence to be subject to\nseasonal factors which would require the establishment to cease operations for\nfive months or more in the calendar year even if it had been in business for\nthe entire calendar year, the new business establishment may meet the\nrequirements of Test A so that its employees will be exempt. For example, an\nemployer may open a new ski slope establishment in November under circumstances\nwhere it is clear that the establishment would have operated less than seven\nmonths in the year regardless of the date it began operations. In such a case\nthe establishment could claim the exemption under Test A. (2)  Test B. Test B is based on the\nestablishment’s experience “during the preceding calendar year.” Generally this\nrequires an entire year’s experience to apply Test B in order to make the\nnecessary calculation. However, in the case of a new business where there is no\n“preceding calendar year” on which to apply Test B, WH will apply the following\ncriteria in determining the applicability of Sec 13(a)(3)(B): a.    \nIf the enterprise of which the new\nestablishment is a part operates other seasonal amusement or recreational\nestablishments, organized camps, or religious or nonprofit educational\nconference centers of the same type in the same general area under\nsubstantially the same conditions and all such establishments conclusively and\nclearly meet the condition of Test B; or b.    \nIf such employer does not have\nother such establishments but other employers operating the same type of\nestablishment in the same general area under substantially the same conditions\nand manner of operation clearly are entitled to exemption under Test B. (b)  \nWage-Hour will consider the\nexemption applicable in the year the new establishment begins operation if\neither of these tests are met provided, however, that in the event after a\nyear’s operation the establishment does not qualify under Test B, proper MW and\nOT is paid retroactively.",
