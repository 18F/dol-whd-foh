If a new employee becomes part of a group, all of whom clearly meet the\ntest of Sec 7(i)(2) based on the representative period designated for them, the\nnew employee may also be treated for enforcement purposes as meeting the test\nof Sec 7(i)(2) from the start of his employment if it can reasonably be\nexpected that, considering the experience and other qualifications of the new\nemployee, there will be no significant difference as to the proportionate\nrelationship between the types of compensation in his situation from that\nprevailing for the other members of the group. Similarly, if a new employee is\nhired to fill a specific job previously occupied by an employee for whom\nsubstantial information as to compensation is available, and if it can\nreasonably be expected that the proportionate compensation for the new employee\nwill not be substantially different from that of the previous employee, the\nperiod applicable to the previous employee can be applied to the new employee. (b)  In situations when it cannot reasonably be expected\nthat the proportionate compensation of a new employee will correspond to that\nshown in the representative period applicable to a group or to the prior\noccupant of the position, as may happen, for example, in the case of a new\nemployee who is inexperienced, Wage-Hour will, for enforcement purposes, permit\nthe employer to determine compliance with Sec 7(i)(2) on the basis of the new\nemployee’s earnings experience (of not less than one month) until the completion\nof the full representative period applicable to other employees in the\ndepartment or establishment.",
