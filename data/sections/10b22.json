  "text": "(a)           \nThe Job Corps is a residential program for youths between 16 and\n21 years of age established under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as\namended. Enrollees live in a Job Corps center (or camp) which is operated by\neither a governmental organization or a private organization, in either case\nsupervised by a Federal Agency. Under Sec 107(a) of this Act, the Director of\nthe Job Corps is authorized to “provide or arrange for the provision of\nprograms of useful work experience and other appropriate activities for\nenrollees”. (b)           \nIn implementing this provision, the Job Corps has made\narrangements for the enrollees to work in private firms where they may perform\nwork covered by the FLSA. Such arrangements with private employers are usually\nfor part-time work and the average duration is four months. In such work\nexperience programs, supervision over the enrollees is maintained in order to\nmonitor their progress and maximize the quality of training given them.\nArrangements are made between the Job Corps and the private employer-trainer\nregarding the division of training costs and the payment of wages. (c)           \nIf a Job Corps enrollee performs work subject to the FLSA in a private\nfirm in such a work experience program he would be considered for purposes of\nthe FLSA to be jointly employed by the corporation operating the center or camp\nand the private employer. Wages paid to enrollees by either of the joint\nemployers will be considered in determining compliance with the Act. (d)           \nIt is the position of Wage-Hour that where such an enrollee is\nassigned to receive training and work experience with a private employer in an\noff-the-center work site, the following activities will not create an\nemployee-employer relationship: (1)          \nIn the preliminary stages of work experience, when the enrollee\nhas had little or no previous training in the occupation and does no useful\nwork, but is merely being acquainted with the employer’s business. (2)          \nTime spent by the enrollee in a classroom situation in which no\nuseful work is performed. (e)           \nThe following activities will generally create an\nemployee-employer relationship assuming productive work is performed: (1)          \nWhen an enrollee has been sent to the employer for a short period\nin order to determine his or her aptitude and interest in an occupation\npreliminary to giving training. (2)          \nWhen the enrollee has been sent to the employer for a short\nperiod in order to determine whether the training received is adequate to enable\nhim or her to get and keep a job in the occupation. (f)           \nJob Corps enrollees also engage in on-site work experience, in\nconnection with the conservation and development of natural resources and\npublic recreational areas usually in conservation centers, and in performing\nother tasks at the center itself. No such work performed by enrollees inures to\nthe benefit of the contractor who provides the training program and WH will not\nassert that these activities are considered as work for an employer within the\ncoverage of the Act. Similarly, classroom activities whether or not resulting\nin a useful product would be part of or incidental to the vocational training\nprogram. (g)           \nIn determining the wages paid employees described in (c) above\nthe joint employers may include the reasonable cost of such items as food,\nlodging, clothing, laundry, transportation to and from work, and medical and\ndental care in accordance with Reg 531. The reasonable cost of providing an\nemployee with medical and dental care may be based on the average of the costs\nactually incurred for all employees over a representative period. (h)          \nIn a Job Corps center (or camp) operated by a private employer,\nthe above principles in no way affect the application of the FLSA or SCA or PCA\nto the employer’s own employees or employees of any subcontractors involved.\n(See also FOH 13b10 and 14c01.)",
