  "text": "(a)   Some independently owned and operated vending machine\ncompanies install, control, service, and supply with merchandise their vending\nmachines located in plants, buildings, transportation terminals, and the like.\nSuch vending machine installations operate and function independently of the\nplant or building in which they are located, under a lessor-lessee arrangement.\nTypically, the machines are installed in groups or banks, in some cases\ntogether with tables and/or benches. There may be several groups of these\nmachines in one building. Employees called “matrons” or “hostesses” are\nassigned to keep the machines filled, offer assistance to customers, make\nchange, maintain the area and generally see to the operation of the machines;\n“inside routemen” may be assigned to stock these machines. In such cases where\nthe machines are independently owned and operated by the vending machine firm\nand are attended by its employees, it is the position of Wage and Hour that\neach group or bank of machines may constitute a separate and distinct\nestablishment; in some cases those vending locations (perhaps one or more\ngroups) which are located in the same building can be considered a single\nestablishment if operated as such. Since sales through vending machines are\nconsidered retail, the employees employed at these locations may qualify for\nexemption under Sec 13(a)(2) if the tests are met. Sec 13(b)(8) may also apply\nsince the food stations will qualify as restaurants. Similarly, an employee who\nservices two or more groups of machines may qualify for exemption per FOH 21a06\nas he or she is considered engaged in retail activities and not central office\nfunctions. (b)  In many cases the groups or banks of machines as\ndescribed in (a) above are controlled by a central office and/or commissary\nkitchen or warehouse located off the premises which purchases merchandise,\nprepares food and performs accounting, clerical, and related duties. These\ncentral offices, etc., do not qualify as retail establishments and employees\nemployed by the firm at such locations are not exempt. (c)   In some cases, usually in larger plants, the vending\nmachine company may operate an office located on the premises to supervise all\noperations of the firm in the particular plant. Such an office may include a\nstorage area for merchandise for the machines. The storage area and office\nserve only the food banks located at the particular plant. The employees\nemployed by the firm work exclusively at this location and the office keeps its\nown records and orders it own supplies. Hostesses and routemen are employed by\nthis office to service the machines located at various points in the plant. In\nsuch a case the firm is operating a business possessing unity of ownership,\nunity of operations, unity of function, and though consisting of separate\n“stations” or “food banks” the business at the location is consolidated and\noperated as a functionally integrated unit. Where a business with such\ncharacteristics is located in one plant, factory, or building and serves no\noutside establishments, the parts of such a business, including the office,\nstorage area, and food banks will be considered one single establishment for\npurposes of exemption. As such, Secs 13(a)(2) and 13(b)(8) may apply if the\ntests are met.",
