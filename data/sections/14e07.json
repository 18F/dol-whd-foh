(See 29 C.F.R. 4.134(b).) (b)  Contracts for the rental of parking space. This type of contract is\noutside the coverage of the SCA as the Government agency is simply given a\nlease or license to use the contractor’s real property. Such a contract can be\ndistinguished from contracts for storage of vehicles which are delivered into\nthe possession or custody of the contractor, who will provide the required\nservices including the parking or retrieval of the vehicles. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.134(b).)",
