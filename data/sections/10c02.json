  "text": "The FLSA\ncontains nothing to indicate that cooperative organizations, as such, are to be\nexcluded form the category of employers subject to its terms. It is clear that\nthe employment relationship may exist at least between such an organization and\nnon-members whom it hires or suffers or permits to work. Nor can it be said\nthat membership in a cooperative in the ordinary case establishes a mutual\nagency analogous to a partnership or otherwise identifies the member so closely\nwith the cooperative that they cannot become, respectively, employer and\nemployee. Among the circumstances which may be taken to indicate that a\ncooperative is an entity separate and distinct from its worker-members, are a\ncorporate form of organization, the presence of the usual incidents of the\nemployment relationship (for example, control by the governing body or a\ndesignated officer over the work performed, the member’s hours of labor,\nselection for and discharge from the job and the like) and the exercise of\nfinancial or managerial control or the furnishing of capital or management\nservices by outsiders, especially if such outsiders are wholesalers, manufacturers,\nor others who purchase or dispose of the products of the cooperatives.",
