(See 41 U.S.C. § 351(a).)  (b)  The SCA is intended to be applied to a wide variety of\nservice contracts. To illustrate this point, the SCA regulations provide a\nlisting of examples of contracts that have been found to come within its\ncoverage. (See 29 C.F.R. § 4.130(a).)  (c)   The nomenclature, type, or particular form of contract\nused is not determinative of SCA coverage. Contracts can be in writing, the\nresult of competitive bidding, awarded on a cost plus basis to a single source\n(“sole” source), a purchase order, or a telephone call to a contractor. (See 29\nC.F.R. § 4.111(a).) (d)  Contracts do not have to involve direct services to\nthe government or an agency, nor do they require the expenditure of funds by an\nagency. Concessionaire contracts in which the contractor provides a service to\nindividual personnel or the general public, for which he or she charges a fee\nto the user and then remits a portion of sale receipts to the government, are\ncontracts for purposes of the SCA unless exempted.
