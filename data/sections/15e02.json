State apprenticeship agencies have no authority over\ntrainee programs. (See 29 CFR §§ 5.2(n), 5.5(a)(4)(ii), 5.16, and 5.17.) (b)  A trainee must be paid at the rate specified in the\nprogram for his/her level of progress, expressed as a percentage of the\njourneyworker hourly rate specified in the applicable WD. Also, trainees are to\nbe paid the fringe benefits stipulated in the trainee program. If the program\ndoes not mention fringe benefits, trainees must receive the fringe benefits\nreflected on the WD for the craft.  NOTE: An exception to this\nrule applies if the Administrator determines that there is a corresponding\napprenticeship program providing for less than full fringe benefits for\napprentices in that particular classification, in which case fringe benefits\nmust be paid trainees in accordance with the corresponding apprenticeship\nprogram. 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(ii). (c)   The principles set forth in FOH 15e0l regarding\nallowable ratio, ratio exceeded, evidence of apprenticeship, unregistered\napprentices, employment by more than one employer, and wage computations for\napprentices are applicable to trainees. (Exception: Portability 15e01(b)(3)\ndoes not apply to trainees.) (d)  A contractor employing participants under the\nWorkforce Improvement Act of 1998 (which superseded the Job Training\nPartnership Act and amended the Wagner-Peyser Act) on a DBRA covered contract\nmust pay such individuals the applicable prevailing wage rate for the\nclassification of work performed unless the requirements in 29 CFR §\n5.5(a)(4)(ii) have been met and the particular training program has been\napproved by ETA (OA). (e)   There are a number of ETA on-the-job training programs\n(for example, the Step-up program) established to train and hire the\nunemployed. Unless the requirements of 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4) are met, individuals\nenrolled in such programs must be paid the applicable prevailing wage rate for\nthe classification of work performed on covered DBRA work. (f)   The requirements of 29 CFR §§ 5.5(a)(4)(i) and (ii) do\nnot apply to apprentices and trainees performing on Federal-aid highway\nconstruction contracts subject to 23 U.S.C § 113 and enrolled in programs\ncertified by the Secretary of DOT, because they are specifically exempted from\nDBRA by the Federal-Aid Highway Act.
