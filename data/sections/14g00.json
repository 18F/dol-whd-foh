  "text": "If a contractor desires to\nsegregate covered work from non-covered work under the SCA for purposes of\napplying the SCA WD, the contractor must identify such covered work accurately\nin the records or by other means. In this regard, an arbitrary assignment of\ntime on the basis of a formula, as between covered and non-covered work, is not\nsufficient. However, if the contractor does not wish to keep detailed\nhour-by-hour records for segregation purposes under the SCA, records can be\nsegregated on the wider basis of departments, work shifts, days, or weeks in\nwhich covered work was performed. For example, if on a given day no Government\nwork was performed by a laundry under its contract, this day can be segregated\nand shown in the records. Similarly, if on a given day only noontime meals were\nprovided by a restaurant under a covered contract to furnish meals to military\npersonnel, employment on the night shift could be segregated. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.169, 4.179.)",
