  "text": "(a)  \nParalegals and legal assistants generally do not qualify as\nexempt learned professionals because an advanced specialized academic degree is\nnot a standard prerequisite for entry into the field.  Although many paralegals\npossess general four-year advanced degrees, most specialized paralegal programs\nare two-year associate degree programs from a community college or equivalent\ninstitution.  See FOH 22i00. 29\nCFR § 541.301(e)(7)WHD\nLetter FLSA 2005-09NAWHD\nLetter FLSA 2005-54NA (b)  \nParalegals with a specialized 4-year degree. The\nlearned professional exemption may be available for paralegals who possess\nadvanced specialized degrees in other fields and apply advanced knowledge in\nthat professional field in the performance of their paralegal duties. For\nexample, if a law firm hires an engineer as a paralegal to provide expert\nadvice on product liability cases or to assist on patent matters, that engineer\nwould qualify for the learned professional exemption. See FOH 22i00. WHD\nLetter FLSA 2005-09NA  (c)  \nParalegals – Administrative exemption. The\nwork of paralegals and legal assistants will not generally meet the discretion\nand independent judgment test of the administrative exemption and thus an\nanalysis of whether their work is related to management or general business\noperations is not necessary. Paralegals perform duties using particular skills\nand knowledge rather than exercising the level of discretion and independent\njudgment required by section 29 CFR § 541.202(a)(3). When paralegals research\nand prepare reports, it is generally the attorneys who exercise discretion and\nindependent judgment because they receive and decide whether or how to act on\nthe information in the reports.  Although\nparalegals may work independently and use their own judgment as to how to\nprioritize their work assignments, including how the projects will be executed\nand how much time to spend on each assignment, it is not sufficient that an\nemployee makes decisions regarding relatively insignificant matters or that an\nemployee makes limited decisions, within clearly “prescribed parameters.” See\nClark v. J.M. Benson Co., Inc., 789 F.2d 282, 287-88 (4th Cir. 1986) and\nDalheim v. KDFW-TV, 706 F. Supp. 493, 509 (N.D. Tex. 1998), aff’d, 918 F.2d\n1220 (5th Cir. 1990). Rather, there must be the exercise of discretion and\nindependent judgment on matters of significance or consequence related to the\nmanagement or general business operations of the employer or the employer’s\ncustomers. A\ntypical paralegal does not formulate or implement management policies, utilize\nauthority to waive or deviate from established policies, provide expert advice,\nor plan business objectives as required to be exempt under 29 CFR § 541.202(b).\nIn addition, most jurisdictions have strict prohibitions against the\nunauthorized practice of law by laypersons. Under the American Bar\nAssociation’s Code of Professional Responsibility, a delegation of legal tasks\nto a lay person is proper only if the lawyer maintains a direct relationship\nwith the client, supervises the delegated work, and has complete professional\nresponsibility for the work produced. The implication of such strictures is\nthat paralegal employees would not have the amount of authority to exercise independent\njudgments with regard to legal matters necessary to bring them within the\nadministrative exemption. See FOH 22i00. WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2006-27                     WHD\nLetter FLSA 2005-54NA (d)  \nSenior Legal Analysts. A\nSenior Legal Analyst who conducts research at the request of an attorney and\nprepares a report for an attorney’s review is performing work involving the use\nof skills and procedures rather than exercising discretion and judgment. The\nattorney who receives the reports exercises discretion and judgment in\ndetermining how to use the report. See FOH 22i00. WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2006-27",
