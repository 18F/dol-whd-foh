  "text": "The fact that the\nfirm’s concessions are “under one roof”, as in the case of a firm which leases\nspace at an airport terminal building, a railway station, or similar restricted\narea, does not of itself create a “single establishment”. (Nor is this\nsituation comparable to that involving the operation of leased departments\nwithin the meaning of IB 779.225 or 779.306.) A determination as to whether the\noperations constitute one or more than one establishment must be made. Among\nthe factors to be taken into consideration are the relative physical location\nof the units, the degree of segregation along functional lines, whether or not\nthere is a common supervisory staff, the amount of employee interchange, and\nthe extent to which separate sales or other records are kept. If it is found\nthe operations constitute more than one establishment, each individual\nestablishment must meet the tests for exemption. With respect to employees who\nperform work for more than one of the establishments see FOH 21a06.",
