  "text": "(a)  \nProfessional sports attendants 29\nCFR 570.35(c)(2) exempts from the hours standards of CL Reg 3 minors 14 and 15\nyears of age who are employed to perform sports-attending services at\nprofessional sporting events provided they are employed outside of school hours\nand perform only those sports-attending duties listed in that section. (1)  Duties which are permitted include pre- and post-game\nor practice setup of balls, items and equipment; supplying and retrieving\nballs, items, and equipment during a sporting event; clearing the field or\ncourt of debris, moisture, etc. during play; providing ice, drinks, towels,\netc., to players during play; running errands for trainers, managers, coaches,\nand players before, during, and after a sporting event; and returning and/or\nstoring balls, items and equipment to club houses or locker rooms after\nsporting events. (2)  Duties which are not permitted include:  grounds or\nfield maintenance such as grass mowing, spreading or rolling tarpaulins used to\ncover playing areas, etc.; cleaning and repairing equipment; cleaning locker\nrooms, showers, lavatories, rest rooms, team vehicles, club houses, dugouts, or\nsimilar facilities; loading and unloading balls, items, and equipment from team\nvehicles before and after a sporting event; doing laundry; working in\nconcession stands or other selling and promotional activities; and performing\nthe duties of an umpire, referee, or other sports official. (b)  \nHigh school graduates, children\nexcused from school on religious grounds, and expelled students(1)  29 CFR 570.35(c)(1) provides exemptions from the CL\nReg 3 hours standards limitations contained in § 570.35(a)(1), (3), and\n(5) for those 14- and 15-year-olds listed below who, for a variety of reasons,\ndo not or cannot attend school.  These exemptions, which stem from long\nstanding WH enforcement positions, were placed in the regulations by the Final\nRule published on May 20, 2010 (see 75 FR 28423).   a.    \nMinors who have graduated from\nhigh school. b.    \nMinors who have been excused from\ncompulsory school attendance by the state or other jurisdiction once they have\ncompleted the eighth grade if compliance is achieved with all the requirements\nof the state school attendance law.   c.    \nMinors who are subject to an order\nof a state or federal court prohibiting them from attending school.  d.    \nMinors who have been permanently\nexpelled from school (not a temporary suspension) and are not required by state\nor local law or ordinance or court order to attend another school.   e.    \nMinors who have a child to support\nand appropriate state officers, pursuant to state law, have waived school\nattendance standards for the minors. (2)  The above minors, however, are subject to the\nremaining conditions established by CL Reg 3, including the occupational\nlimitations and the provisions that permit them to work only between the hours\nof 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. (9:00 p.m. between June 1 and Labor Day).   (3)  None of the exceptions listed in this section apply to\nyouth employed in agriculture.  The prohibition against the employment of youth\nunder 16 years of age in agriculture during the hours the local public school\nis in session (except when employed by his or her parent on a farm owned or\noperated by that parent) is statutory.  No exception from the prohibition\nagainst employment during school hours, other than the parental exemption, is\nprovided by the FLSA for employment in agriculture. (c)  \nWork Experience and Career\nExploration Program (WECEP) (1)  29 CFR 570.36 provides for certain variations from CL\nReg 3 for minors 14 and 15 years of age who are enrolled in and employed\npursuant to a state Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP) that\nhas been approved by WH.  In order to qualify for such variations, a state\neducational agency (normally the state Department of Education) must file a\nletter of application with the WH Administrator for approval of a program\nplan.  Individual schools or school districts may not apply for or be granted a\nWECEP by WH; approval is granted only to the state government.   a.    \nAfter WH has authorized the state\nprogram, records of the names and addresses of each school enrolling students\nin the WECEP, as well as the number of students enrolled, must be kept at the state\neducational office and made available for review in that office by WH\nrepresentatives.  Additionally, the state educational agency or the local\nschool must keep on file a copy of the written training agreement that is\nrequired for each student participating in the WECEP.  These records must be\nkept for a period of three years.   b.    \nA list of states that have been\nauthorized to operate a WECEP can be found at www.dol.gov/whd. (2)  Hours of work for WECEP students 29\nCFR 570.36(d) provides that students who are working under an approved WECEP\n(including those employed in nonhazardous agricultural occupations) may be\nemployed for as many as 3 hours on any school day and 23 hours in any week\nschool is in session, any portion of which may be during school hours.  No\nother changes, however, in the hours standards established by CL Reg 3 are\npermitted and the standards will not be waived.  (3)  Occupations for WECEP students a.    \n29 CFR 570.36(c) prohibits WECEP\nparticipants from being employed in the occupations of mining, manufacturing,\nand those the Secretary of Labor has declared to be hazardous for the\nemployment of minors between the ages of 16 and 18 (the HOs).  This same\nsection provides for the employment of WECEP students in some occupations\notherwise prohibited under CL Reg 3 if a “variance” has been issued by the WH\nAdministrator. b.    \nVariances.  Before a student may\nbe employed in a prohibited occupation, the state educational agency must\nsubmit a written request for a variance to the WH Administrator which outlines\nall the steps the WECEP will take to ensure that the minor can safely perform\nthe work in question.  Information regarding the classroom and on-the-job\nsafety training, supervision, and personal protective equipment the youth will\nreceive must be detailed in the request.  1.    \nWECEP variance approvals are\nspecific to the school operating the WECEP and the employer that employs the\nstudent.  Variance approvals run concurrently with the WECEP approval period of\nthe state program (up to two years).  Variances are valid only during the\nmonths school is in session for the WECEP participant.  The variances are not\nvalid during summer vacation periods.   2.    \nThe most common occupations\ncovered by WECEP variance requests that have been approved by the NO on an\nindividual basis, include:  A.   \nCooking over electric and gas\ngrills that does not involve cooking with an open flame and cooking with deep\nfat fryers.  Prior to February 14, 2005 when new CL Reg 3 cooking rules became\neffective, these requests allowed WECEP participants to perform cooking duties\nthat were not “in plain view” of the customer.  After February 14, 2005, WH\nwill consider issuing, on a case by case basis, variances that allow WECEP\nstudents to operate deep fat fryers that are not equipped with devices that\nautomatically raise and lower the baskets. B.   \nUnloading trucks at retail and\nfood service establishments.  The variance approvals issued by the National\nOffice impose limitations on the amount of weight that may be lifted and the\namount of time that may be spent performing this task. C.   \nOperating power-driven lawn mowers\n(not riding mowers) and weed-eaters that use plastic “string” (not metal) to\ncut vegetation.  Limitations on the amount of time WECEP participants may\nperform these duties are detailed on the variance approvals. D.   \nWashing and cleaning of school\nbuses.  The variance approvals allow WECEP participants to work in garages and\n“bus barns” but not to use power washing equipment, step ladders or ladders,\nnor to work in “pits” when washing or cleaning buses. (4)  Wage rates for WECEP students WECEP\nstudents generally must be paid the applicable MW rate (including a Youth\nMinimum Wage where applicable).  Student-learner certificates cannot apply to\nthe employment of WECEP participants because, by definition, student-learners\nmust be at least 16 years of age (see 29 CFR 520.300).  Under certain\nconditions, properly certified employers may pay WECEP participants less than\nthe applicable federal minimum wage as full-time students in accordance with\nFLSA § 14(b) (see 29 CFR part 519). (d)  \nWork-Study Program (WSP) (1)  29 CFR 570.37 provides for certain variations from CL\nReg 3 for minors 14 and 15 years of age who are enrolled in and employed\npursuant to a Work-Study Program (WSP) that has been approved by WH.  In order\nto qualify for such variations, the superintendent of the school attended by\nthe WSP candidate must first file with the WH Administrator a letter of\napplication for approval of the WSP. (2)  The WSP is open only to youth enrolled in a college\npreparatory curriculum.  A WSP student-participant must receive, every school\nyear he or she participates in the WSP, at least the minimum number of hours of\nclassroom instruction required to complete a fully-accredited college preparatory\ncurriculum (as determined by the State Educational Agency responsible for\nestablishing such standards).  Such classroom instruction shall include, every\nyear the youth participates in the WSP, training in workplace safety and state\nand federal child labor provisions and rules. (3)  Hours of work for WSP participants a.    \nEmployment of student-participants\nin the WSP authorized by § 570.37 will be confined to not more than 18 hours in\na week when school is in session, a portion of which may be during school hours\nin accordance with the following formula that is based upon a continuous\nfour-week-cycle. 1.    \nIn three of the four weeks, the\nparticipant is permitted to work during school hours on only one day per week,\nand for no more than for eight hours on that day. 2.    \nDuring the remaining week of the\nfour-week cycle, the WSP student-participant is permitted to work during school\nhours on no more than two days, and for no more than for eight hours on each of\nthose two days. b.    \nThe employment of WSP\nstudent-participants must also comport with the time of day and number of hours\nstandards contained in §§ 570.35(a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(6). c.    \nThe limitations on the number of\nhours that participating students may be employed, as described in FOH\n33b02(d)(3) above, constitute the absolute maximum number of hours that\nparticipants may be employed.   1.    \nParticipating schools and\nemployers may choose to adopt some other schedule of work hours that comports\nwith the established maxima—such as one four-hour day or one six-hour day each\nworkweek; or two eight-hour days each weekend; or three hours a day at the end\nof each of three school days, as long as those hours comply with end-of-day\nhours standards established by § 570.35(a)(6).  2.    \nThey are, however, prohibited from\nallowing the same participant to work during school hours on more than one\nschool day in any school week—except every fourth week in the four-week cycle\nwhen such youth may work during school hours on no more than two school days in\nthat week. (4)  Occupations for WSP students   a.    \nWSP participants must be employed\nin accordance with the provisions of §§ 570.33 and .34. b.    \nThe WSP has no provisions for\nspecial occupational variances like those found in WECEP. (5)  Wage rates for WSP students   a.    \nWSP students generally must be\npaid the applicable MW rate (including a Youth Minimum Wage where applicable). \nStudent-learner certificates cannot apply to the employment of WSP participants\nbecause, by definition, student-learners must be at least 16 years of age (see\n29 CFR 520.300).  Under certain conditions, properly certified employers may\npay WSP participants less than the applicable federal MW as full-time students\nin accordance with FLSA § 14(b) (see 29 CFR part 519).  b.    \nSome WSP students may wish to\nassign their wages to their school to defray the cost of the students'\neducations.  WH will not take exception to such assignments as long as they\ncomport with the provisions of 29 CFR 531.40. (e)  \nYouth employed by a parent in a\nbusiness owned entirely by that parent are exempt from the CL Reg 3 hours\nstandards (see FOH 33e00).",
