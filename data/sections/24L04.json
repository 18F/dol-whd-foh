  "text": "(a)   Sec 13(b)(10) provides an OT exemption\nfor employees of the various described establishments (see FOH 24L03) who are\nemployed as a “salesman”, “partsman”, or “mechanic”, and who are “primarily\nengaged” (see IB 779.372(d)) in selling or servicing the named vehicles, farm\nimplements or aircraft (see chart FOH 24L04). Assuming that the establishment\ntests are met, it is thus necessary to determine whether the employee’s duties\nare in fact those of a salesman, partsman, or mechanic (or some combination of\nthese duties where appropriate), and, if so, whether he is primarily engaged in\nselling or servicing the named vehicles, farm implements or aircraft. The\nexemption applies on a w/w basis. It is not pertinent that such salesmen,\npartsmen, or mechanics are individually engaged in selling to or servicing the\nnamed product primarily for the “ultimate purchaser”; it is only necessary for\nthe establishment to be primarily so engaged for the exemption to be applicable\n(see FOH 24L08). (b)   In determining whether an employee is in\nfact a salesman, partsman, or mechanic, a primary duty test shall be applied.\nThus, for example, an employee to be classified as a “mechanic” must spend more\nthan 50% of his time in performing the duties of a mechanic, with respect to\nthe named vehicles, farm implements, or aircraft, including duties which are\nincidental thereto. (For purposes of applying the primary duty test, all the\nduties of an employee as a salesman, partsman, or mechanic may be combined.) (c)   Partsman. The term “partsman”, as used in Sec\n13(b)(10), means an employee whose primary duty is to requisition, stock, and\ndispense parts for the named vehicles, farm implements or aircraft to be used\nby the establishment’s employees, or to sell or dispense such parts to the\nestablishment’s customers (see IB 779. 372(c)(3)). This includes incidental\nclerical duties involved in such work, and keeping the stockroom, bins, and\nshelves in order. (See also subpart (e) of this Sec.) (d)   Mechanic. (See IB 779.372(c)(3).) The term\n“mechanic”, as used in Sec 13 (b)(10), generally describes an employee whose\nprimary duty is to perform mechanical work on a named vehicle, farm implement,\nor aircraft to place it in proper operating condition by making any necessary\nadjustments or repairs. This includes an employee doing mechanical work such as\n“get ready” mechanics, automotive, truck, trailer, farm implement or aircraft\nmechanics, body or fender mechanics, used car reconditioning mechanics, and\nwrecker mechanics. Work of the following types is not in itself considered\nmechanical work for purposes of the primary duty test in applying Sec 13(b)(10)\neven though performed on a named vehicle, farm implement or aircraft: (1) \nwashing, cleaning or\npolishing (2) \nlubricating (3) \npacking wheel\nbearings (4) \nchanging oil and oil\nfilters (5) \nchanging tires (6) \npainting (7) \ncarpentry (8) \ndispatching (9) \ninstalling or\nrepairing seat covers (10) \nchecking, servicing,\nor repairing the plumbing, electrical, and butane gas systems, the doors,\nwindows and other structural features of mobile home trailers (as opposed to\nthe running mechanisms, such as wheels axles, brakes, hitches, and signal\nlights). However,\nsuch work may be performed in some instances by an employee as an incident to\nmechanical work and would be included as the work of a “mechanic” in applying\nthe primary duty test. For example, an automotive repairman may install ball\njoints or tie rods on the “front end” of a truck or automobile and lubricate\nthe repaired parts when he has finished; he may replace a broken piston and in\nthe process change oil and install a new oil filter; or he may replace a wheel\nbearing and at the same time repack it with the necessary lubricant. (e)   Parts chaser. A “parts chaser” whose primary duty is\nthat of a messenger to pick up needed parts, as directed, from the warehouse\nand from other dealers is not exempt under Sec 13(b)(10) as a “partsman”. On\nthe other hand, if the primary duty of such an employee is to see to the\nadequacy of the stock on hand and to procure necessary stock, to make billings,\nand to clean parts for return to the factory under warranty replacement, he\nwould be considered a “partsman” for purposes of the exemption. (f)   Mechanic - irrigation systems. Farm implement dealers who sell or\nservice irrigation systems and component parts (see FOH 24L07) may have\nemployees engaged in repairing such items or in cutting, fitting, and tailoring\nat the shop the items sold, to meet the needs of a particular farming\noperation. Such activities are considered to be those performed by a “mechanic”\nas the term is used in Sec 13(b)(10). Employees engaged in assembly of an\nirrigation system or components in the field (after repairs have been made or\nthe cutting, fitting and tailoring at the shop has been done) are not\nperforming the work of a “mechanic” to whom the exemption is intended to apply.\nThe possibility of exemption under Sec 13(a)(6) or Sec 13(b)(12) should not be\noverlooked. (g)   Trimmers. Some automobile dealers employ persons\ncalled “trimmers”. The following are examples of duties performed by trimmers\nwhich are considered mechanical work for purposes of the 50% test of section\n13(b)(l0): repairing the cranking mechanism of car window; repairing interior\nof doors and roofs of cars; repairing windshield wiper mechanisms; and repairing\nchrome strips around door frames. (h)  Diagnosticians and inspectors. Employees variously described as\ndiagnosticians and inspectors may be considered as being akin to service\nwriters. (See IB 779.372(c).) Such employees may use machines and also do visual\ninspections to note the condition of a vehicle, and indicate the parts and\nservices necessary for repairs. Diagnosing and inspecting in and of itself, as\nwould be the case for example when diagnostic and inspection work is done for\nother mechanics would not be exempt. However, where an employee is a mechanic\nand is working as a mechanic and part of his employment is diagnosing and\ninspecting the vehicle before doing the actual repair, such diagnostic and\ninspection work is part of his exempt work. (i)    Job comparison - old Sec 13(b)(10) and\nnew 13(b)(l0).  \n\n\n \n  \n  Job\n  \n  \n  Vehicle\n  \n  \n  Prior\n  to 5/1/74 – Old - 13(b)(10)\n  \n  \n  Beginning\n  5/1/74 – New - 13(b)(10)\n  \n \n \n  \n  Salesman\n  \n  \n  Automobiles\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n \n \n  \n  Salesman\n  \n  \n  Trailers\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n \n \n  \n  Salesman\n  \n  \n  Trucks\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n \n \n  \n  Salesman\n  \n  \n  Farm\n  implements\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n \n \n  \n  Salesman\n  \n  \n  Aircraft\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n \n \n  \n  Salesman\n  \n  \n  Boats\n  \n  \n  No\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  Partsman\n  \n  \n  Automobile\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n \n \n  \n  Partsman\n  \n  \n  Trailers\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n  \n  No\n  \n \n \n  \n  Partsman\n  \n  \n  Trucks\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n \n \n  \n  Partsman\n  \n  \n  Farm Implements\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n \n \n  \n  Partsman\n  \n  \n  Aircraft\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n  \n  No\n  \n \n \n  \n  Partsman\n  \n  \n  Boats\n  \n  \n  No\n  \n  \n  No\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n  Mechanic\n  \n  \n  Automobiles\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n \n \n  \n  Mechanic\n  \n  \n  Trailers\n  \n  \n  No\n  \n  \n  No\n  \n \n \n  \n  Mechanic\n  \n  \n  Trucks\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n \n \n  \n  Mechanic\n  \n  \n  Farm Implements\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n  \n  Yes\n  \n \n \n  \n  Mechanic\n  \n  \n  Aircraft\n  \n  \n  No\n  \n  \n  No\n  \n \n \n  \n  Mechanic\n  \n  \n  Boats\n  \n  \n  No\n  \n  \n  No\n  \n \n\n\n                                                (j)    Enforcement policy for period prior to\n5/1/74. Wage-Hour takes no position with respect\nto alleged OT violations in any current investigation during the period prior\nto 5/1/74 where the employee, e.g., boat salesman, is entitled to the OT\nexemption on the basis of new Sec 13(b)(10) but would have been subject to OT\npreviously. FOH INSERT 1757 (Rev No. 663) 5-3-2011 –\nremoved 24L04(k)",
