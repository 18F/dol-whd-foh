A person who desires employment usually registers with\nthe temporary help firm.

If work is available or becomes available, he is sent or taken to\nthe customer’s establishment. If accepted by the customer, he remains and\nperforms the work of that employer. At the end of the day, the worker is free\nto go home and collect his pay later or to return to the central location to be\npaid for his work. The circumstances vary. If the employment understanding\nclearly is that the pay or the time of the employee begins and ends at the\ncustomer’s establishment, waiting for assignments at the central location or in\ntravel from there to the customer’s establishment and return would not be\ncompensable worktime. In other words, his working time is computed in the same\nmanner as if he had gone directly from his home to the customer’s establishment\nand returned home from there at the end of the day.
