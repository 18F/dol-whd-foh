Real estate\nsales employees will generally meet this test, since “sales” under 29 U.S.C.\n§ 203(k) includes contracts to sell. (b)  \nAn exempt outside sales employee also must be customarily\nand regularly engaged “away from the employer’s place or places of business” in\nmaking such sales.  Real estate sales employees typically are required, as a\ncustomary and regular part of their employment, to spend time as necessary at the\nsite of property to be sold and in visiting prospects at the latter’s homes and\noffices as a part of their sales effort.  Most of them must leave whatever\nplace of business of the employer they use as headquarters in order to perform\nthese tasks. (c)  \nA real estate sales employee stationed in a model home on a\ntract from which parcels of real property are being sold with or without\nimprovements, leaving the model home for such purposes, customarily and\nregularly, would meet the requirement of the definition, so far as making sales\n“away from” the employer’s place of business is concerned.  This is true even\nthough all of the property shown to prospects by the sales employee is within\nthe tract on which the model home is located.  Further, not every home called a\n“model home” would be a place of business of the employer.  One which is in the\nnature of an “open house” to which a sales employee is assigned to meet\nprospects who may buy that house or another similar one on the tract may more\nproperly be viewed as analogous to the hotel sample room of a traveling sales\nemployee referred to in 29 CFR § 541.502 than to an actual place of business of\nthe employer.  Moreover, time spent on return to the model home or other\nheadquarters to conclude a sales transaction or to continue the sales effort\nwith the prospect would be deemed part of the sales employee’s outside sales\nactivity. WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2007-01 WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2007-02 (d)  \nCertain activities performed by real estate sales employees\nin the employer’s place of business may be exempt work if the activities\nperformed are in conjunction with and in furtherance of their outside sales\nwork.  For\nexample, the employees may perform duties at their employer’s place of business\nincluding: (1)  Bringing a\nmultiple listing book up to date,  (2)  Calling\nprospects with whom the sales employee has been dealing during outside sales\nactivities,  (3)  Dictating or\nwriting letters to such prospects,  (4)  Talking to such\nprospects in the office about their particular transactions,  (5)  Calling a list\nof prospective buyers or sellers of homes with whom the sales employee has had\nno prior contact, (6)  Preparing a\ncontract and other forms required for a sale negotiated during the sales\nemployee’s outside sales activity, and  (7)  Talking to a\n“walk-in” prospect with whom the employee has had no prior contact and showing\nphotographs and discussing terms on specific houses, if such activity results\nin subsequent outside sales activity with the prospect. (e)  \nTimeshare resort salespeople. Employees\nwhose primary duty is to promote and to sell timeshare interests in resorts\nowned or operated by their employers do not qualify for the outside sales\nexemption when they sell timeshares on site at the resorts because they are not\nengaged in sales away from their employer’s place of business. Sales conducted\nat an office away from the resort that is a place of business of their employer\nwould also not qualify as sales made away from the employer’s place of\nbusiness. These employees may meet the tests of the outside sales exemption if\nthey customarily and regularly make sales at a location that is not the\nemployer’s place of business.    The\nquestion with timeshare salespeople is whether they are customarily and\nregularly engaged away from the employer’s place of business in performing\ntheir primary duty of making sales.  A resort is generally maintained on a\npermanent basis as a location of the employer and is staffed with the necessary\npersonnel for maintaining the resort facilities.  Although the employer\nsells timeshare interests in some of the properties on the resort, the employer\nalso retains a continuing business interest in the remaining resort facilities,\nand in maintaining both the resort and the timeshare units that have been\nsold.  Under these facts, the entire resort must be considered the\nemployer’s place of business.   Timeshare\nsalespeople differ from real estate sales employees selling lots of land from a\nmodel home on a subdivision, who customarily and regularly leave the model\nhome, because in the latter situation the employer does not maintain a\ncontinuing interest in the subdivision lots once they are sold or in the other\nfacilities in the subdivision, and thus these areas are not part of the\nemployer’s place of business.   If\ntimeshare resort salespeople never leave the employer’s place of business,\nnamely, the resort, they do not qualify for the outside sales exemption.   WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2007-04",
