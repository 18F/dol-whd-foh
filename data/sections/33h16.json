  "text": "Name:  Occupations in Roofing Operations and On or About a Roof Originally Adopted:  December 27, 1961 (a)  \nScope of HO 16 (1)  At the time HO 16 was written, roofing had long been\nrecognized as one of the most hazardous occupations in the building\nconstruction industry.  The report establishing HO 16 determined the hazards\nassociated with roofing – such as falling from roofs and leaning out over the\nedge of a roof to receive hoisted materials – were difficult to control and the\nresulting injuries were frequently very serious.  In light of this, the report\nconcluded that “all work performed in connection with the application of\nweather-proofing materials and substances to the roofs of buildings and\nstructures is too hazardous for the employment of 16 and 17 year old persons.” (2)  HO 16 was originally specific to the roofing industry,\nprohibiting all roofing industry operations, including those operations not\nperformed on a roof.  HO 16 was revised, effective February 14, 2005, to also\nprohibit all work on or about a roof (see 69 FR 75397-98).   (3)  Definitions (see 29 CFR 570.67(b)) a.    \nThe term roofing operations means\nall work performed in connection with the installation of roofs, including\nrelated metal work such as flashing, and applying weatherproofing materials and\nsubstances (such as waterproof membranes, tar, slag or pitch, asphalt prepared paper,\ntile, composite roofing materials, slate, metal, translucent materials, and\nshingles of asbestos, asphalt, wood or other materials) to roofs of buildings\nor other structures.  The term also includes all jobs on the ground related to\nroofing operations such as roofing laborer, roofing helper, materials handler\nand tending a tar heater.  b.    \nThe term on or about a roof\nincludes all work performed upon or in close proximity to a roof, including\ncarpentry and metal work, alterations, additions, maintenance and repair,\nincluding painting and coating of existing roofs; the construction of the\nsheathing or base of roofs (wood or metal), including roof trusses or joists;\ngutter and downspout work; the installation and servicing of television and\ncommunication equipment such as cable and satellite dishes; the installation\nand servicing of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment or similar\nappliances attached to roofs; and any similar work that is required to be\nperformed on or about roofs. 1.    \nThe regulatory phrase on or about\na roof is not limited to circumstances where the minor employee is standing or\nworking on the roof itself.  The prohibition extends to standing or working on\na ladder or scaffold at or near the roof, working on the installation of roof\ntrusses or joists which will support the roof, as well as working from or being\ntransported to or from the roof in mechanical devices such as hoists.   2.    \nGenerally, 16- and 17-year-olds\nmay legally perform certain occupations that require them to work at heights,\nsuch as painting, window washing, installing siding, and the power-washing of\nwalls.  But such occupations would be prohibited when the minor is required to\nwork in close proximity to a roof.  WH has adopted two enforcement positions\nthat provide guidance as to when the employment of a youth performing such\noccupations violates HO 16 because he or she is working in close proximity\nto a roof (See FOH 33h16(d)(1)). (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED (1)  HO 16 prohibits all occupations in roofing\noperations.  This includes work done on the ground such as material handling,\ntending tar kettles, and clean-up work. (2)  As of February 14, 2005, HO 16 also prohibits the\nperformance of any work on or about a roof. (3)  Minors under 18 years of age are also prohibited from\nusing a roof as a point of access, egress, or a platform from which to access\nor perform other work such as window washing or the rigging of window washing\nequipment. (c)  \nExemptions HO 16 does contain an exemption for student-learners and apprentices. \nThere are no other exemptions applicable to this order. (d)  \nEnforcement positions (1)  Working in close proximity to a roof a.    \nSingle-story building  1.    \nWH will not charge a violation of\nHO 16 when a minor is working in proximity to a roof of a one-story building as\nlong as the minor’s feet are never more than three feet off the ground level. \nThe three-foot tolerance is measured from the ground or pavement at the base of\nthe building to the bottom of the minor’s feet.   2.    \nThe minor is still prohibited from\nperforming any work described in FOH 33h16(a)(3) above. b.    \nMultiple-story building 1.    \nWH will not charge a violation of\nHO 16 when a minor is working in proximity to a roof of a multi-story building\n(a building of more than one story) if the minor always maintains a distance of\nat least three feet (36 inches) from the roof edge.  The 36 inches is measured\nfrom the top of the youth’s head to bottom edge of the roof that is directly\nover (perpendicular to) the youth’s head.      2.    \nA distance of 3 feet ensures that\nthe working minor, no matter how long his or her reach, will not come into\ncontact with the bottom edge of the roof of a multi-story building. 3.    \nUsing a straight, vertical line\nfrom the top of the minor’s head to the bottom of the roof’s edge to measure\nthe 36 inch allowance permits minors to work at various heights on buildings\nthat do not have horizontal or single-level roof lines, such as split level\nbuildings, gabled buildings and sheds. c.    \nThe enforcement positions\ndiscussed in a. and b. above apply only as long as the minor does not use the\nroof to egress the work area and is not performing work that is prohibited by\nHO 16 or any other HO. (2)  Removal of an old roof The tearing off of the\nold roof in conjunction with the installation of a new roof is considered a\n“roofing operation” and is covered under HO 16, notwithstanding that different\nmechanics may perform this work in various geographic areas. (3)  Metal buildings   a.    \nPrior to February 14, 2005, the\ninstallation of metal roofs generally did not fall within the prohibitions of\nHO 16 because such work was normally performed entirely by ironworkers,\nsteelworkers, or sheet metal mechanics – not by roofers.  Consequently, in most\ninstances, this work was not considered a “roofing operation” prohibited by HO\n16.  On February 14, 2005, HO 16 was revised to prohibit youth under 18 years of\nage from installing metal roofs, including those on metal buildings (see\n29 CFR 570.67(b)). b.    \nRoofing companies do occasionally\nremove existing all-metal roofs and replace them, and the purlins, with a new\nroof.  The work continues to be considered a “roofing operation” covered by HO\n16. (4)  Weatherproofing the top of television transmitting\ntowers   The definition of a\nroofing operation includes the application of weatherproofing materials to\nroofs of buildings, or other structures (see 29 CFR 570.67(b)).  Consequently,\nweatherproofing the top of television transmitting towers is covered by HO 16.  (5)  Measuring a roof The measuring of a\nroof to estimate the cost of a new roof is work “performed in connection with\nthe installation of roofs…” and it is covered by HO 16.",
