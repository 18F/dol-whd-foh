  "text": "(a)  \nDistribution of a total bonus may\nalso take into account such factors as length of service, attendance lateness,\nproduction, efficiency, place of employment, job classifications, and the like.\nFor example, the gross earnings of each participating employee may be weighted\nby multiplying them by a length of service factor such as 1.0 for one year, 1.1\nfor two years, 1.2 for three years, and so on. A total bonus can then be\ndistributed on a percentage basis to each individual member sharing in the\nbonus by dividing the total weighted payroll of the participating employees\ninto the total bonus. If each participating employee is then paid as his share\nthis percentage of his total weighted earnings for the bonus period, the bonus\nmathematically will include both straight-time and OT and the payment will be in\ncompliance with the FLSA and PCA. Such a bonus distribution may be based on\nmore than one such factor by multiplying the gross earning of each employee by\nthe additional factors and then determining each employee’s share as above. (b)  \nThe weighting of employees’ gross\nearnings to take into account length of service and similar factors is not\ninvalid provided it is not designed to circumvent the OT requirements of the\nFLSA or PCA. It would, for example, be improper to apply a factor that decreases\nin inverse proportion to the OT worked by various groups of employees. A\n“group” to which a particular factor is to be applied may happen to include\nonly one employee and still be valid. However, it should be clear that the\ndollar amount of the employee’s share of the total bonus has not been\ndetermined before establishment of the value of the length of service or other\nfactor that is applied to his gross earnings. If the gross earnings of each of\nthe participating employees is weighted by a factor of different value, there\nwould be some evidence that the values of the factors had not been\npredetermined.
