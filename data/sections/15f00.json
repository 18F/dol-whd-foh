(FAR 48 CFR §§ 52.222-6 through 15.) (b)  The labor standards clauses in 29 CFR § 5.5 included\nin a prime contract are by their terms required to be included as well in any\nsubcontract or any lower tier subcontract made thereunder. Contractors who\nsubcontract by means of purchase orders or other informal type contract forms\nwill be considered in compliance with 29 CFR § 5.5 provided they attach copies\nof the applicable WD and labor standards clauses to the subcontract form. (See\n29 CFR § 5.5(a)(6).) (c)   When the labor standards clauses are omitted from\nsubcontracts in which they should have been included, and are not incorporated\nby reference in the subcontracts, the right of the subcontractor’s employees to\nreceive compensation in accordance with the wage determination in the prime\ncontact is not affected. In such circumstances, since the subcontractor did not\ncontract to pay the DBRA rates, the subcontractor would not generally be held\nresponsible. However, the prime contractor would be obligated to pay the\nsubcontractor’s laborers and mechanics as required by the labor standards\nprovisions of the prime contract.",
