  "text": "(a)   “Reasonable\ncost” cannot exceed the actual cost to the employer. In deciding whether wage\ncredits for facilities are in amounts permissible under Sec 3(m) and Reg 531,\nexperience and judgment must be used by COs and ADs. It should be kept in mind\nthat the test in Reg 531.3 is “reasonable cost” rather than market value or\ncomparable prices. “Reasonable cost” does not include a profit to the employer.\nThe cost of furnishing lodging and/or other facilities must be established\nbased upon available records. The employer has the burden of establishing such\ncost and must maintain adequate records to support a determination, as required\nby Reg 516.27. Bills, purchase orders, and cash register tapes may be\nappropriate for such purpose. A comparison of wage credits for comparable\nfacilities furnished by other employers in the area may also provide guidance. (b)   The\nmethod used by an employer for determining “reasonable cost” must be based on\ngood accounting practices. Good accounting practices do not include accounting\npractices which are not accepted by the Internal Revenue Service. (c)   Furthermore,\nan employer may not take a credit where no cost is incurred. For example, when\na meal is made available to an employee, but is not consumed, and subsequently\nis retained in the employer’s inventory for service to customers, no credit may\nbe taken.",
