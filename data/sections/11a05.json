  "text": "(a)   Employees of an agency engaged in the intrastate\ndistribution of out-of-State advertising, manufacturers’ samples, and telephone\ndirectories by hand to local individuals and businesses may be subject to the\nFLSA as engaged in interstate commerce. Where the items distributed are\nreceived from out-of-State sources, they remain in the stream of interstate\ncommerce until they reach the destination intended for them by the importer.\nThus, they remain in interstate commerce while they are being distributed from\ndoor to door. With respect to telephone books, for example, there is a\npre-existing contract or understanding with the subscribers for their delivery.\nThe door-to-door delivery is not any more of an interruption in the interstate\njourney than the drop-shipment delivery to a customer of out-of-State goods by\nany local transportation company. The distributing companies are merely agents\nfor their principals, their only function being to make deliveries of the\nadvertising matter, manufacturers’ samples, or telephone directories in\naccordance with previous understandings or instructions. (b)   Employees engaged in the collection and shipment of\nold telephone directories across State lines are engaged in interstate commerce\nand in the production of goods for interstate commerce.",
