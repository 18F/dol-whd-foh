  "text": "(a)   Ambulance drivers and attendants who transport persons\non part of an interstate trip (as to or from an airport or railway terminal) or\nwho travel across State lines in performing ambulance services are engaged in\ncovered activities. (b)   Ambulance crews engaged in making intrastate trips to\npick up dead or injured victims of motor vehicle accidents from the scenes of\nsuch accidents on city streets, county roads or State or federal highways are\nalso engaged in individually covered activities. It is well established that\nvehicle accidents which interfere with the interstate movement of goods and\npersons on the highways require prompt action to remove the stopped and\ndisabled vehicles which constitute a costly and dangerous impediment to the\nfree movement of such commerce. The vehicles blocking the traffic cannot in\nmost instances be permitted to be moved from their post-accident positions on\nthe roadway until such persons as may have been injured or killed in the\naccident have been attended to. Ordinarily, this requires ambulance service\nwhenever a highway accident involves deaths or personal injuries of a serious\nnature. To appreciate the serious effect on traffic of any delay in the arrival\nof ambulances and removal of damaged vehicles by towtrucks in such cases, it is\nonly necessary to listen to the aerial police reports on traffic during the\nrush hours in any sizable city. Detours, delay, and congestion of traffic on\nany interstate route in which one or more lanes become blocked by such\naccidents are the rule until the vehicles are removed, which police ordinarily\ndo not permit pending necessary attention to any victims of the accident. Such\nambulance service is not “isolated local activity”, but rather so closely\nrelated to the movement of commerce and the functioning of its instrumentalities\nas to be a part thereof. (See also FOH 24c08 and IB 779.369(e).)",
