  "text": "(a)   The exemption under Sec 13(b)(3) is not\nan industry or establishment exemption. It applies to individual employees of an\nair carrier when their activities bear a reasonably close relationship to the\nexempt type of transportation activities which bring the employer’s operation\nunder Title II of the Railway Labor Act. Title II applies to “every common\ncarrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign commerce, and every carrier by\nair transporting mail for or under contract with the United States Government,\nand every air pilot or other person who performs any work as an employee or\nsubordinate official of such carrier or carriers, subject to its or their\ncontinuing authority to supervise and direct the manner of rendition of his\nservice”. The performance of nonexempt work will defeat the exemption where\nsuch work exceeds 20% of the employee’s total work during a w/w (see IB 786, Subpart\nA). (b)   Work performed by mechanics on training\nplanes, transient planes, and on planes other than those used in operations\nwhich subject the employer to Title II of the Railway Labor Act clearly has no\nrelation to exempt air transportation and would, if it constituted a\nsubstantial part of their work, defeat the exemption. Flyers and other\nemployees who operate a flying school also perform nonexempt work, as do\nemployees who sell airplanes and parts.",
