This is so even\nthough the production, sale, distribution, and consumption is wholly\nintrastate. (b)   Employees engaged in the production of energy to\noperate the movable facilities of interstate commerce, such as interstate\ntrucks or railroad rolling stock, or to propel oil through an interstate\npipeline, or to send telephone, telegraph, and radio impulses across State\nlines, are individually covered. They are similarly covered by the FLSA where\nthe energy operates the channels of interstate commerce, such as a drawbridge\nwhich carries an interstate highway, the signal equipment of a railroad along\nits road-bed, or the beacon lights at an airport. The same is true when the\nenergy is used to operate fixed facilities of interstate commerce, such as\nfreight and passenger terminals, pipeline and electric transmission power\nstations, telephone exchanges, and radio and telegraph stations.",
