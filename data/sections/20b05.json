  "text": "(a)  \nIn some cases\nnursery operators and florists purchase or secure agricultural or horticultural\ncommodities, such as rooted cuttings or young plants, from others and it\nbecomes necessary to determine whether the activities of particular employees\nin connection with these commodities constitute primary agriculture, i.e.,\n\"cultivation, growing.. . .\" within the meaning of Sec 3(f). In\nmaking such a determination it is necessary to consider all the facts and circumstances\nincluding whether the operations performed on the plants are calculated to\nproduce growth to maturity or substantial maturity or whether the operations\nare merely designed to care for and preserve the plants while they are on the\nemployer’s premises. Among the factors to be considered are:(1) \nThe stage of\ndevelopment of the plant at the time it is obtained, i.e., whether it is\nimmature, substantially mature or fully matured; and (2) \nThe nature and\npurpose of operations performed on the plant; and (3) \nThe length of\ntime the plant is retained from the time it is obtained to the time of sale or\nother disposition and its stage of development at the time. (b)  The principles set forth in (a) above\nare not hard and fast rules but must be applied in the total fact situation to\naid in determining the actual purpose and result of the activities engaged in\nby the employees. The following examples will serve to illustrate the\napplication of these principles. Where plants are received in a state of\nsubstantial maturity and are merely potted and preserved for a short period of\ntime prior to sale or other disposition, the activities of employees engaged in\ncaring for such plants would not be considered \"cultivation\" or\n\"growing\" within the primary definition of agriculture. This would be\nthe case where substantially mature trees and shrubs from other nurseries are\nplanted or \"healed in\" for later use in landscaping operations. On\nthe other hand, where rooted cuttings or young plants are received and require\nsubstantial growth to reach maturity and where a root system must be developed\nand regular and intensive care such as spraying, watering, and fertilizing must\nbe performed, the activities of employees performing such operations will be\nconsidered as \"cultivation\" or \"growing\" within the\ndefinition.
