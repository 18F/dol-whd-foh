  "text": "(a)   The internal inspection of sewer lines for leakage and\ndamage through the use of closed circuit T.V. inspection and the simultaneous\nsealing of leaks or other damage in the lines as the machine inspects the sewer\nline is covered by DBRA. On the other hand, if the contract is only for\ninspection, DBRA would not apply. However, SCA would apply in the latter\nsituation if the Government was a direct party to the contract. (b)  When this type of work is an issue in an\ninvestigation, an area practice survey (FOH § 15f05) should be conducted to\ndetermine which classification, if any, in the applicable wage determination\nperforms this work. In conducting the area practice survey, evidence should be\ngathered concerning specific projects where repair work was actually performed.\nIf the survey does not show that a classification in the applicable wage\ndetermination has actually performed this type of work, the use of a conformed\nclassification and rate would probably be appropriate (29 CFR § 5.5(a)(1)(ii)).",
