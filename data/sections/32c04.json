  "text": "(a)  \nWhether a bonus may be distributed\nas a percentage of total earnings of each participating employee or by the\nboosted hour method to achieve compliance with the OT provisions of the FLSA or\nPCA, depends on whether the additional money to be paid is a true bonus or\nwhether it is a device to evade the payment of OT. If the so-called “regular\nrate” of the employee is so low as to be obviously fictitious, the “bonus” in\nall probability will be a part of the regular straight-time earnings upon which\nOT compensation must be computed. On the other hand, if the additional money to\nbe paid is a true bonus, it may be distributed in proportion to the total\nearnings (exclusive of the bonus) of each participating employee properly\ncomputed to include time and one-half for the OT hours or in proportion to the\nboosted hours worked during the bonus period. (b)  \nExtra payments not directly\nrelated to hours worked, production, or efficiency, such as profit-sharing type\nbonuses and year-end or Christmas bonuses which fail to meet the tests for\nexclusion from the regular rate of pay under FLSA Sec 7 will generally be found\nto be true bonuses. Production bonuses and labor saving bonuses present a more\ndifficult problem. For investigation purposes, if the Inv finds that such\nadditional payments periodically made are not merely devices for the\npostponement of the full payment to the employees of their ordinary wage or\nsalary or devices for the perpetuation of an obsolete pay structure, he will be\njustified in concluding that the payments are true bonuses. In this event, such\npayments could be made as a percentage of total earnings or by the boosted hour\nmethod. Evidence that the payment is not being used for evasive purposes may be\nfound in the fact that the wages otherwise paid to the employees are fair and\nnot out of line with wages which might ordinarily be expected to be paid for\nthe occupation in the locality. The determination should be based on the actual\nor potential operation of the bonus plan during a reasonably extended series\nfor pay periods. (c)  \nMany employers distribute bonuses\non the basis of total straight time hours or earn­ings. If an investigation\ndiscloses that a bonus has been distributed in this manner and OT has been\nworked, the investigation will be handled as follows: (1)  If the bonus is of the type not directly related to\nhours worked, production or efficiency but which for some reason fails to\nqualify for exclusion from the regular rate under Sec 7(e), no request for back\nwages shall be made. In such cases the employer shall be informed of possible\nSec 16(b) liability and of the steps necessary to effect compliance. The number\nof employees and the estimated amount of back wages shall not be shown on Form\nWH-51. The narrative shall contain a concise statement of the facts. Where an\nemployee involved in such bonus payments is due back wages arising from other\ncauses, the payment of such of other back wages will be requested and\nsupervised. (2)  If the bonus is a production bonus, a cost of living\nbonus or any other bonus directly related to hours worked, production or\nefficiency, OT violations will be recorded and the employer will be requested\nto pay the back wages. (3)  In the case of either (1) or (2) above, it must be\nkept in mind that the payments may be excludable under the provisions of FLSA\nSec 7(g)(3) - Reg 548.",
