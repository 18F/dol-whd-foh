  "text": "(a)           \nThe court has held that patient workers in hospitals or\ninstitutions whose work is of any consequential economic benefit to the\nfacility are to be treated as employees. While the court has generally\nconsidered all circumstances in determining whether an employment relationship\nexisted, the court specifically rejected as determinative the alleged\ntherapeutic value of the work or the patient’s level of performance. In\ngeneral, we would hold that there is consequential economic benefit to the\ninstitution if the work in question would be performed by someone else if it\nwere not done by the patient. However, where a patient is undergoing evaluation\nor training, we will not hold the patient to be an employee during the first\nthree months of engagement in a work activity or activities provided the\npatient spends no more than one hour a day and no more than 5 hours a week in\nsuch activities and provided further that competent instruction and supervision\nis provided the patient during such period. (b)           \nA patient in a hospital or institution may volunteer and need not\nbe considered an employee for such services which would not be compensated by\nthe institution if performed by a person other than a patient. Such volunteer\nservices may include wheeling another patient in a wheelchair to and from\ncertain activities, planting a vegetable garden if the fruits of such labor\nbelong to the patient, and other similar activities. However, the ordinary\nmaintenance, patient care, office work and other activities that are performed\nin the operation of an institution would create an employment relationship.",
