  "text": "(a)  \nPursuant to Sec 3(m), all tips\nreceived (i.e., given to or designated for the employee by a patron) by a\n“tipped employee” must be retained by the employee except to the extent that\nthere is a valid pooling arrangement.  Thus, the effect of the language of Sec\n3(m) precludes an agreement between an employer and a “tipped employee” that\nany part of tips received by such employee belongs to the employer and must be\nturned over to the employer.  Further, the specific language added to Sec 3(m)\nreinforces the intent of Congress that an employee who receives $30 per month\nin tips is a tipped employee and that the employer and the employee cannot\nagree to remove the employee from that status or agree to waive such employee’s\nright to retain all tips received.  Such an employee must retain all tips\nreceived from customers, whether in cash or through allocation by credit card\ncharges, and in addition must receive remuneration from the employer for at\nleast 60 percent of the applicable MW in the w/w. (b)  \nWhere an employer does not strictly observe the provisions\nof Sec 3(m), no tip credit may be claimed and the employees are entitled to\nreceive the full cash MW, in addition to any tips they may have received.  For\nexample, where an employer does not inform employees of the statutory\nprovision, or pays no wages to employees who receive tips, the full MW in cash\nis due and no tip credit will be allowed. (1)  Several\ncourts have held that an employer who did not comply with the tip credit\nprovisions of Sec 3(m) was not entitled to take a tip credit on a retroactive\nbasis.  For example, an employer who paid no wages (i.e., employees received\nonly tips) was required to pay the full MW to achieve retroactive compliance\nrather than simply pay 60 percent of the MW as BWs.  Similarly, employers who\nacquired all or a portion of employees’ tips were not permitted to take the tip\ncredit and, in addition, were required to restore the tips to the employees. (2)  In\nthe past, in the administrative settlement of investigations which disclosed\nviolations of the tip credit provisions of Sec 3(m), WH permitted employers to\nachieve retroactive compliance (for example, by restoring tips) and allowed\nemployers to retroactively claim the tip credit.  In view of the court\ndecisions, WH will not allow an employer to claim the tip credit on a\nretroactive basis unless all aspects of Sec 3(m) have been met.  (Also see FOH\n52n00.)",
