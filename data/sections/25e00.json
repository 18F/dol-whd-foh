(Emphasis added by underscoring.) (b)  \nFor the period 2/1/67 - 4/30/74,\nthe wording of old Sec 13 (a)(13) was identical to current Sec 13(b)(28);\nhowever, Sec 13(a)(13) was both a MW and OT exemption. (c)  \nPrior to 2/1/67 the wording of Sec\n13(a)(15) was identical to Sec 13(a)(13) except that the number of employees\nread “does not exceed twelve” instead of “does not exceed eight”. (Emphasis\nadded.) (d)  \nUnder the Act as amended, the exemption\ncontinues to be in applicable in any w/w where the number of employees employed\nby the employer in the named operations exceeds twelve. The MW standard of Sec\n6(a)(l) and OT after 40 hours applies to such employment. Beginning 5/1/74, in\nany w/w where all the tests of Sec 13(b)(28) are met except that the number of\nemployees exceeds eight but does not exceed twelve, the exemption does not\napply and the MW standard of Sec 6(b) and OT after 40 hours apply.
