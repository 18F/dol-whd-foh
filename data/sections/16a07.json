  "text": "The application of\ngarnishments to tips and gratuities under the CCPA is similar to the treatment\nof their ownership under the FLSA. (a)   Bona fide tips are not subject to the provisions of\nthe CCPA. A garnishment is inherently a procedural device designed to reach and\nsequester earnings held by the garnishee (usually the employer). Tips paid\ndirectly to an employee by a customer are not “earnings” within the meaning of\nsec 302 of the CCPA, since they do not pass to the employer. This includes gratuities\ntransferred free and clear to an employee at the direction of credit customers\nwho add tips to the bill. (b)  Service charges added to a customer’s bill constitute\n“earnings” within the meaning of sec 302 when passed on to the employee. As\nsuch, they are subject to the provisions of the CCPA. The following examples\ndemonstrate the point. (1) \nA restaurant charges a customer\n15% of the check, as a service charge, and in turn pays this amount to the\nserver (debtor). Since this is an automatic charge, there is no gratuity by the\ncustomer. The compensation passed from the employer (garnishee) to the server. (2) \nThe employment agreement is such\nthat the customer’s tips belong to the employer and must be credited or turned\nover to the employer.",
