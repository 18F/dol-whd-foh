  "text": "Public\nLaw 101-583 (Nov. 15, 1990), directed DOL to issue regulations permitting\ncomputer systems analysts, computer programmers, software engineers, and other\nsimilarly-skilled professional workers to qualify as exempt executive,\nadministrative, or professional employees under 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1); the law\nalso exempted employees in the named occupations if they were paid on an hourly\nbasis at a rate of at least 6 ½ times the minimum wage.  These statutory\nprovisions were incorporated into former 29 CFR §§ 541.3(a)(4) and 541.303, as\npart of the “professional” employee exemption, in 1992.  When Congress\nincreased the minimum wage in 1996, Congress adopted most – but not all – of\nthe Department’s regulatory language constituting the computer employee\n“primary duty test” as a separate statutory exemption in a new 29 U.S.C. §  213(a)(17). \n29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(17) exempts “any employee who is a computer systems analyst,\ncomputer programmer, software engineer, or other similarly skilled worker,\nwhose primary duty …” meets one of three specified sets of duties, or a\ncombination of the specified duties requiring the same level of skills.  The\n1996 amendment also froze the hourly compensation test at $27.63 (which equaled\n6 ½ times the former $4.25 minimum wage).  The 1996 law included no delegation\nof rulemaking authority to DOL to further interpret or define the scope of the\nexemption; however, it also did not repeal the original 1990 statute. The 2004 part\n541 final rule aligned the duties test in the regulatory text with the 1996\nlaw. Thus the same duties test now applies for determining the exempt status of\ncomputer-related occupations under either 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) or 29 U.S.C.\n§ 213(a)(17), but an exempt computer employee may be paid either “on a salary\nbasis” at a rate not less than $455 per week, or on an hourly basis at a rate\nnot less than $27.63 per hour. 69\nFR 22158 through 22160FAB\nNo. 2006-3",
