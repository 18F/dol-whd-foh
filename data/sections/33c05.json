  "text": "(a)  \n29 CFR 570.33(d) prohibits the\nemployment of 14- and 15-year-olds in or about boiler or engine rooms and  in\nconnection with the maintenance and repair of the establishment, machines, or\nequipment.  Maintenance would generally include the cleaning of such machines\nor equipment.   (b)  \nCL Reg 3 includes certain\nexceptions to the above maintenance (cleaning) prohibitions regarding kitchen\nequipment and motor vehicles. (1)  Kitchen Equipment.  29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and\n15-year-olds to clean kitchen equipment (not otherwise prohibited by CL Reg 3\nor the Hazardous Occupations Orders) under certain conditions.  a.    \nSuch minors may clean kitchen\nequipment, remove oil or grease filters, pour oil or grease through filters,\nand move receptacles containing hot grease or hot oil, but only when the\nequipment surfaces, containers and liquids do not exceed a temperature of 100\n°F.   1.    \nQuestions have been raised as to\nhow compliance with this provision can be achieved and maintained—that the\ntemperature of equipment, surfaces, containers and liquids being cleaned,\nfiltered and/or transported do not exceed 100 °F (see 69 FR 75399, December 16,\n2004).   2.    \nIn some situations,\nemployer-installed thermometers could ensure that the required temperature has\nbeen reached.  A.   \nCleaning schedules that\nincorporate adequate “cooling down” periods, or that are executed before the\nheating elements of the equipment are activated, can help ensure compliance\nwith this provision. B.   \nClearly articulating policies that\nrequire compliance to managers and other employees and monitoring can help\nensure compliance with this provision. C.   \nOSHA has advised WH that an individual\nperforming such cleaning functions would not normally experience a first degree\nburn until the equipment, surfaces, containers and liquids being cleaned,\nfiltered and/or transported reached a temperature of at least 140 °F. \nAccordingly, it is WHD’s position that, generally, a violation of 29 CFR\n570.34(i) has occurred whenever a covered 14- or 15-year-old employee received\nat least a first degree burn while performing these named duties.   b.    \nCL Reg 3 does not prohibit a minor\nfrom performing the normal grill “maintenance” that an employee routinely does\nduring the actual cooking process involving the use of water and a spatula to\nscrape away and remove food particles and grease from the surface of the\ngrill.  This position applies only to electric and gas grills that do not\ninvolve cooking with open flames (see 69 FR 75388, December 16, 2004). (2)  Motor Vehicles.  29 CFR 570.34(n) permits 14- and\n15-year-olds to perform work in connection with cars and trucks if confined to\nthe following:  dispensing gasoline and oil; courtesy services such as window\nwashing and checking oil levels; car cleaning, washing and polishing that is\ndone by hand; and other occupations permitted by CL Reg 3, but not\nincluding work involving the use of pits, racks, or lifting apparatus, or\ninvolving the inflation of any tire mounted on a rim equipped with a removable\nretaining ring.  This exception does not allow 14- and 15-year-olds to operate\nor maintain automatic car wash equipment or systems.",
