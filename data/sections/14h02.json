  "text": "(a)   “Conformance” is the method used to establish wage\nrates for classes of service employees to be employed on a covered service\ncontract that are not listed on the WD included in the contract (i.e., the work\nto be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the WD). (See\n29 C.F.R. § 4.6(b)(2).) (1) \nContractors should conform wage\nrates for any unlisted class of service employee before such an employee\nperforms any contract work and classify unlisted classes in a manner that\nprovides a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill\ncomparison) between the unlisted class and the classes listed in the WD. (2) \nConformed wage rates must be paid\nto all employees in the affected class retroactive to the date such employees\ncommenced any contract work. Such rates are treated as if the rates and classes\nhad been included on the original WD issued for the contract. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.6(b)(2)(v).) (3) \nConformances may not be used to\nartificially subdivide classes already listed in the WD. For example, a stock\nclerk as defined in the “SCA Directory of Occupations” is the same job in terms\nof knowledge, skills, and duties as the shelf stocker and store worker II. If a\nstock clerk was listed in the WD, a conformance cannot be based on splitting\nthe job into two jobs and establishing a hybrid classification, e.g., shelf\nstocker and stock clerk II. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1).) (4) \nWhere WDs list a series of levels\nwithin a job classification family, e.g., Engineering Technicians I through VI,\nthe lowest level listed for a job classification family is considered to be the\nentry level and establishment of a lower level through conformance is not\npermissible. A conformance cannot establish a job level below the entry level\nlisted in the WD. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1).) (5) \nTrainee classifications cannot be\nconformed. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1).) (6) \nHelper classifications in skilled\nmaintenance trades (e.g., electricians, machinists, automobile mechanics, etc.)\ncannot be conformed. Helper classifications in skilled maintenance trades whose\nduties constitute separate and distinct jobs may be used if listed in the WD.\n(See 29 C.F.R. 4.152(c)(1).) (b)  Conformance Procedures. (1) \nThe contractor is required to\nprovide a written report of a proposed conformance, including information as to\nwhether the employees involved or their authorized representative agree or\ndisagree with the conformed wage rates and FBs, to the contracting officer no\nlater than 30 days after such unlisted class begins to perform work on the\ncontract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(ii).) (2) \nThe contracting officer, after\nreviewing the proposed conformance, is required to submit a report that\nincludes the agency’s recommendation to the NO/Division of Wage Determinations/Branch\nof Service Contract Wage Determinations for review. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.6(b)(2)(ii).) (3) \nThe Branch will approve, modify or\ndisapprove the proposed conformance or render a final determination within 30\ndays of receipt of the report or will notify the contracting agency that\nadditional time is necessary to review the report. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.6(b)(2)(ii).) (4) \nThe Branch will transmit the final\ndetermination to the contracting officer who is to promptly notify the\ncontractor of the action taken. The contractor is required to furnish each\naffected employee with a copy of the conformance determination or post it at\nthe job site as part of the WD. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(iii).) (5) \nIf the contracting agency does not\nagree to submit a conformance, the WHD may initiate action pursuant to 29\nC.F.R. § 4.6(b)(2)(vi) for a final determination of a proper conformed\nclassification, wage rate and/or FBs. (6) \nIn the case of a contract\nmodification, an exercise of an option or extension of an existing contract,\nthe conformance procedures provide an “indexing procedure” for previously\nconformed classifications. A contractor can increase a previously conformed\nrate by the average percentage increase between the rates listed in the current\nWD for all classifications to be used on the contract and those rates specified\nfor the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable WD without\nobtaining WH approval or agreement by the employees involved, but must notify\nthe contracting officer. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.6(b)(2)(iv)(B).)",
