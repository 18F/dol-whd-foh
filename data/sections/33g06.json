  "text": "(a)  \nHOs 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17\ncontain limited exemptions for apprentices and student-learners provided they\nare employed under certain conditions (see 29 CFR 570.50).  None\nof these limited exemptions, however, permit apprentices or student-learners to\ndrive motor-vehicles as part of their training programs. (b)  \nApprentices.  The provisions of the HOs listed in (a) above do\nnot apply to the employment of apprentices provided: (1)  the apprentice is employed in a craft recognized as an\napprenticeable trade (the Office of Apprenticeship (OA), part of the Employment\nTraining Administration can provide guidance), (2)  the work of the apprentice in the hazardous occupation\nis incidental to the apprentice training, is intermittent and for short periods\nof time, and under the direct and close supervision of a journey worker, and (3)  the apprentice is registered by OA (or a state agency\napproved by OA) or is employed under a written apprenticeship agreement which\nconforms to federal or state standards as determined by the Secretary of Labor. (c)  \nStudent-Learners  (1)  The provisions of the HOs listed in (a) above do not\napply to the employment of a student-learner enrolled in a course of study and\ntraining in a cooperative vocational training program under a recognized state\nor local educational authority or in a course of study in a substantially\nsimilar program conducted by a private school, provided that the student-learner\nis employed under a written agreement which provides: a.    \nThat the work of the\nstudent-learner in the occupation declared particularly hazardous shall be\nincidental to the training, b.    \nThat such work shall be\nintermittent and for short periods of time, and under the direct and close\nsupervision of a qualified and experienced person, c.    \nThat safety instruction shall be\ngiven by the school and correlated by the employer with on-the-job training,\nand d.    \nThat a schedule of organized and\nprogressive work processes to be performed on the job shall have been prepared. (2)  The student-learner discussed in this section can be\n(and usually is) different from those student-learners for whom an employer may\nobtain a certificate to pay a subminimum wage under 29 CFR part 520.  An\nemployer does not have to obtain the special certificate that allows him or her\nto employ student-learners at wages less than the minimum wage in order to take\nadvantage of this limited exemption from certain HOs. (3)  WH considers a Jobs Corps training program to be\nequivalent to “a course of study in a substantially similar program conducted\nby a private school” under 29 CFR 570.50(c)(1) and employers of Job\nCorps enrollees could take advantage of the limited exemption for\nstudent-learners if all the other conditions listed\nin 29 CFR 570.50(c) are met. (4)  A high school graduate may be employed in an\noccupation in which he or she has successfully completed training as a\nstudent-learner without the restrictions imposed by 29 CFR 570.50(c)(1)\nand (2), even though he or she is not yet 18 years of age.  Such minors must be\nemployed in compliance with the all the remaining child labor provisions (the\nremaining HOs that do not have student learner exemptions).  Merely graduating\nfrom high school is not sufficient to trigger this limited exemption from the\nstudent-learner provisions; the minor must also have successfully completed the\nappropriate vocational training. (5) \nThe\nstudent-learner exemption is not limited to the school term but applies during\nthe summer vacation provided all the terms of the exemption are met (see\n29 CFR 570.50(c)).  The required “direct and close supervision” and\nsafety instructions will ordinarily be provided by the coordinator or an\nappropriate school official during the summer months.  It is also necessary to\nestablish that the student  plans to be enrolled in a bona fide vocational\neducation program the term following the vacation period. (d)  \nThe following\ndefinitions, applicable to the limited exemption from certain HOs, were\ndiscussed in detail in the preamble of the April 17, 2007 Advance Notice of\nProposed Rulemaking (see 72 FR 19328,\n19332). (1) \nThe terms intermittent\nand short periods of time are not defined in the regulations and determinations\nconcerning the employment of each apprentice and student-learner are made on a\ncase-by-case basis after reviewing all the facts of the particular situation. \nThe following items will be considered when making such determinations: a.    \nAn apprentice or\nstudent-learner may not be the principal operator of prohibited machinery.  He\nor she must work under the close supervision of a fully qualified and\nexperienced adult, such as a journey-level worker in the case of an apprentice. b.    \nThe duties assigned\nthe minor may not be such that he or she is constantly operating the prohibited\nmachinery during the work shift, but may only do so when required by the\ntraining experience.  This precludes an apprentice or student-learner from\nbeing a production worker responsible for spending a significant proportion of\nthe workday performing prohibited work. c.    \nWhile no universal time line may be imposed, the\ncontinuous performance of otherwise prohibited work (operating prohibited\nmachinery) for more than one hour in a workday is more than intermittent and\nmore than for a “short period of time.”  The performance of otherwise\nprohibited work throughout a work shift which totals\nmore than 20% of the apprentice’s or student-learner’s work shift is also more\nthan for a “short period of time.” (2)  The\nterm direct and close supervision is not defined in the regulations. \nApprenticeship agreements registered with OA or OA-approved state agencies,\nhowever, do establish ratios concerning the number of journey workers and\napprentices that may be on the job site at any one time.  These ratios help ensure\nworker safety and that the apprentices receive both proper training and\nsupervision.  According to OA, the most widely used ratio is one apprentice for\nthe first journey level worker on-site and one apprentice for every three\nadditional journey workers thereafter.  For the purpose of the limited\nexemption contained in 29 CFR 570.50, the requirement of direct and\nclose supervision is met when there is one journey worker or experienced adult\nworking with the first apprentice or student-learner on-site, and at least\nthree journey workers or experienced adults working along side each additional\napprentice or student-learner.  The requirement for direct and close\nsupervision only applies during the periods when the apprentice or\nstudent-learner is actually performing the otherwise prohibited work.",
