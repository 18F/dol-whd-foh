Therefore, the employer has complete discretion in choosing the\nmanner in which the compulsory service charge is used, which would include\nusing it to pay servers and/or server helpers (busboys/busgirls). Where service\ncharges are imposed and the employees receive no tips, the employees are not\n“tipped employees” and the employer must pay the entire minimum wage and\novertime required by FLSA.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)  If, in addition to service\ncharge income, the servers receive tips from customers, such tip income may be\ncredited toward the minimum wage in the usual manner if the employee qualifies\nas a tipped employee and the employer has met all obligations to claim a tip\ncredit. 29 CFR §§ 531.52 and .55WHD Opinion Letter FLSA 2005-31",
