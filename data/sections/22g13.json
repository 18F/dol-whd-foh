  "text": "(a)  \nEmployers are free to require use of leave, thus reducing\ntime available in a leave bank, at any time. Since leave time is not required\nby the FLSA, there is no prohibition against an employer giving vacation time\nand later requiring that such vacation time be taken on a specific day.  WHD\nLetter FLSA 2005-41NA   (b)  \nSection 541.602(b)(1) states that “deductions from pay may\nbe made when an exempt employee is absent from work for one or more full days\nfor personal reasons.”  Salary deductions, therefore, may be made when\nexempt employees voluntarily take time off for personal reasons, other than\nsickness or disability, for one or more full days.  For instance, an\nexempt employee paid $500 per week on a salary basis may take voluntary time\noff for personal reasons for four days in a workweek and receive one fifth of\nthe salary.  The employee’s decision to take voluntary time off, however,\nmust be completely voluntary and not “occasioned by the employer or by the\noperating requirements of the business.” 29\nCFR § 541.602(a)   WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2009-14 (c)  \nAn employer may require use of leave for periods of\ninclement weather, either in whole or partial day increments. If the firm is\nopen for operations, the employer may make deductions from salary for one or more\nwhole days of absence if the employee chooses to not report to work. A\ndeduction for an employee’s choice to not report to work during a period of\nadverse weather is a deduction for personal reasons, other than sickness or\ndisability. If the firm is not open for operations, the employer must pay the\nfull amount of the salary due for any week in which the employee performs any\nwork. Neither an employee’s status as a probationary employee, nor the fact\nthat an employee may have a zero or negative accrued leave balance, provides an\nexcuse for the employer to pay less than the full amount of salary required to\nmaintain the employee’s salary basis status if the firm is not open for\noperations. WHD\nLetter FLSA 2005-41NA WHD\nLetter FLSA 2005-46NA (d)  \nAn employer may require exempt employees to use accrued\nvacation time during a plant shutdown of less than a workweek without violating\nthe salary basis test. Likewise, an employer may require employees to use paid\ntime off to accommodate staffing levels needed during a period of reduced\nworkload. Since\nemployers are not required under the FLSA to provide any vacation time to\nemployees, there is no prohibition against an employer giving vacation time and\nlater requiring that such vacation time be taken on a specific day(s). \nTherefore, an employer may direct exempt staff to take vacation or debit their\nleave bank account, whether for a full or partial day’s absence, provided the\nemployees receive in payment an amount equal to their guaranteed\nsalary.   WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2009-02  (e)  \nMandatory unpaid time off, when required for increments of\nless than a full work week, in order to accommodate day-to-day or week-to-week\nfluctuations of business will violate the requirement to pay on a salary basis.\nThis differs from a situation where a salary is reduced prospectively to\nreflect a bona fide reduction in normal scheduled hours.
