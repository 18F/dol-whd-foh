  "text": "(a)   Pursuant\nto Reg 531.38, taxes which are assessed against an employee and which are\ncollected by the employer and paid to the appropriate government agency may\nconstitute “wages”. (b)   The same\nprinciple applies to taxes which, although owed by the employee, are paid by\nthe employer. Thus, an employer may pay an employee’s share of social security\n(FICA) taxes. Such payment constitutes “wages” and may therefore be credited\ntoward the MW and OT requirements. (1)  Where an\nemployee receives the MW of $3.35, the employer and the employee must each make\nan FICA contribution of 24 cents an hour ($3.35 x .0715 = .2395). (7.15 percent\nis the current FICA rate which is, of course, subject to change.) \n\n\n \n  \n  Example:\n  \n \n \n  \n  Employer\n  pays employer  $3.11\n  Employee\n  pays FICA  $0.24\n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  $3.35\n  \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n  \n  Payroll Costs:\n  \n \n \n  \n  Employer\n  pays employee  $3.11\n  Employee\n  pays FICA  $0.24\n  Employer\n  pays FICA  $0.24\n  \n \n \n  \n  Total\n  payroll costs  $3.59",
