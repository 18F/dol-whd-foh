  "text": "(a)  \n29 CFR 570.33(f) prohibits 14- and\n15-year-olds from occupations involving the operation of motor vehicles or\nserving as helpers on such vehicles.  This same section prohibits such youth\nfrom riding on a motor vehicle, inside or outside of an enclosed passenger\ncompartment, except as permitted by § 570.34(o) (see FOH 33c07(d)).  In\naddition, 29 CFR 570.33(k) prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from loading and\nunloading goods or property to and from motor vehicles, railroad cars, or\nconveyors, except for those hand tools, personal protective equipment and\npersonal items specifically permitted by § 570.34(k).   (b)  \nThe term motor vehicle, defined in\n29 CFR 570.52(c)(1), means any automobile, truck, truck-tractor, trailer,\nsemitrailer, motorcycle, or similar vehicle propelled or drawn by mechanical\npower and designed for use as a means of transportation but does not include\nany vehicle operated exclusively on rails. (1)  A motor vehicle does not have to be designed for use on\npublic roads, or actually be used on public roads, to fall within the\nprohibitions of CL Reg 3.  This differs from the prohibitions of HO 2 (see\n29 CFR 570.52).   (2)  In addition to the examples listed in 29 CFR\n570.52(c)(1), WH has made the following determinations regarding the definition\nof a motor vehicle under 29 CFR part 570:  a.    \nPower-driven golf carts and all\nterrain vehicles (ATVs) are motor vehicles (see 75 FR 28408, see\nalso FOH 33h02(3)).  The “Cart Caddy” and “QuicKART,” two types of machines\noften used by grocers and other retail stores to move large strings of shopping\ncarts, are not considered to be motor vehicles under 29 CFR part\n570 (see FOH  33h07(c)(5) and  33c06(e)(5)). b.    \nCertain amusement park rides or\nequipment, such as go-carts, parade vehicles, and coaches, are motor vehicles\nas defined by 29 CFR 570.52(c) (see FOH 33c06(e)(8)).   (c)  \nThe term motor vehicle helper is\nnot defined in CL Reg 3.  Reg 3 prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from “service as\nhelpers on such vehicles”.  This provision has been included in CL Reg 3,\nwithout change, since the inception of the regulations as a temporary rule in\n1938.  WH’s interpretation of the term motor vehicle helper has evolved over\nthe years and was influenced by the definition of outside helper contained in\nHO 2 (see 29 CFR 570.52(c)). (1)  For purposes of CL Reg 3, WH considers a helper on a\nmotor vehicle to be one whose employment assists in the operation of a motor\nvehicle used in the transportation or delivery of persons or property.  Duties\nmay include assisting in the pick-up and/or delivery of people or property, the\nloading or unloading of the vehicle, shifting property around the vehicle,\nassisting the driver of the vehicle or other helpers on motor vehicles.   (2)  A helper on a motor vehicle does not have to\nultimately ride as a passenger, either inside or outside of the vehicle, to be\nconsidered a helper under CL Reg 3.  But the mere fact that a minor rides as a\npassenger on a vehicle during working hours does not make that minor a “helper”\nunder CL Reg 3. a.    \nSection 570.34(k) permits 14- and\n15-year-olds to load onto and unload from motor vehicles the light, personal,\nnon-powered hand tools, personal protective equipment, and other personal items\nthat they will use as part of their employment under certain conditions (see\nFOH 33d05). b.    \nYouth peddling and door-to-door\nsalespersons as motor vehicle helpers 1.    \nSection 570.33(j) prohibits the\nemployment of minors under 16 years of age in youth peddling or as door-to-door\nsalespersons—selling such things as candy, greeting cards, calendars, etc. \nYouth peddlers often perform motor vehicle helper duties prohibited by CL Reg 3\n(see FOH 33c07(c)(2)b.). 2.    \nMinors who are illegally employed\nas youth peddlers often do more than simply ride in the crew leader’s van or\nautomobile while being transported to the sales areas—they often facilitate the\nsales operations by performing such activities as sorting merchandise and\npacking peddler’s kits while in transit, or loading and unloading the\nmerchandise being sold.  When performing these tasks, the youth peddlers are\nalso engaged as helpers on a motor vehicle under CL Reg 3. 3.    \nMinors who merely ride in the crew\nleader’s vehicle and perform no activities that facilitate the movement of the\npersons or property being transported would not be considered to be helpers on\na motor vehicle under CL Reg 3. (d)  Riding as a passenger on motor vehicles (1)  29 CFR 570.34(o) permits 14- and 15-year-olds to ride\ninside passenger compartments of motor vehicles when: a.    \nThey are not the operator of the\nvehicle, b.    \nThey are not serving as a helper\non the vehicle, c.    \nA significant reason for them\nbeing a passenger in the vehicle is not to perform work in connection with\ntransporting, or assisting in the transporting, of other persons or property, d.    \nEach minor riding in the passenger\ncompartment must have his or her own seat, each seat must be equipped with a\nseat belt or similar restraining device, and the employer must instruct the\nminors that such belts or other devices must be used.  This requirement is similar\nto those contained in FLSA § 13(c)(6) and 29 CFR 570.52(b) (see FOH\n33h02(d)(1)), and e.    \nEach driver transporting the young\nworkers must hold a State driver’s license valid for the type of driving\ninvolved and, if the driver is under the age of 18, his or her employment must\ncomply with the provisions of § 570.52. (2)  Should any of the requirements detailed in FOH\n33c07(d)(1) not be met, a violation of CL Reg 3 has most likely occurred.",
