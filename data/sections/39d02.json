  "text": "(a)   Eligible\nemployees are entitled to up to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave for placement with\nthe employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; such leave must\nbe taken within 12 months of the placement.  Adoption means legally and\npermanently assuming the responsibility of raising a child as one’s own.  Foster\ncare is 24-hour care for children in substitution for, and away from, their\nparents or guardian. Such placements involve state action, voluntary or\ninvoluntary removal of the child from the parents or guardian, and an agreement\nbetween the state and foster family that the family will care for the child. \nFMLA leave may be taken for a foster care placement of any duration. 29 CFR 825.122(f) - (g)WHD Opinion Letter\nFMLA-84 October 25, 1996 (b)   Employees\nmay take FMLA leave before the actual placement of a child if an absence from\nwork is required for the placement or adoption to proceed.  For example, FMLA\nleave may be taken for required counseling sessions, court appearances or\nconsultations with an attorney or doctor representing the child. (c)   Leave\ntaken after the placement of a healthy child for adoption or foster care may be\ntaken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only with the employer’s\nagreement. (d)   Multiple\nplacements for adoption or foster care in a single leave year are separate FMLA-qualifying\nevents.  However, employees are not entitled to more than 12 weeks of leave for\nany combination of qualifying reasons in a single leave year.  See FOH 39d09\nfor special rules applicable to military caregiver leave.  Leave for each\nindividual child placed must be completed within 12 months of the date of the\nplacement. WHD Opinion Letter\nFMLA-84 October 25, 1996 (e)   If a\nchild is placed in a home for foster care and is subsequently adopted by the\nsame family, only the placement for the foster care is an FMLA-qualifying\nevent.  The child would be newly placed at the time of the foster care\nplacement rather than when the subsequent adoption occurs. WHD Opinion Letter\nFMLA 2005-1-A (f)   The FMLA\ndefinition of “son or daughter” includes a child of a person standing in loco\nparentis to the child.  Therefore, an employee who will assume the responsibilities\nof a parent to an adopted or foster child is entitled to FMLA leave to bond\nwith the child during the first 12 months following the placement, regardless\nof blood or legal relationship.  For example, if one member of an unmarried\ncouple adopts a child, and the other member of the couple will be assuming the\nresponsibilities of a parent towards the child, then both individuals would be\nentitled to take FMLA leave for the placement of the child.  See FOH 39d03(d)(4). WHD Administrator’s\nInterpretation No. 2010-329 CFR 825.121",
