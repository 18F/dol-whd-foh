  "text": "Garnishments for consumer\ndebts may not exceed the amount permitted under sec 303(a). (See FOH 16b00(a).)\nSupport garnishments are limited to the amount permitted under sec 303(b)(2).\n(See FOH  16b00(b).) Once the applicable limit is reached, no other garnishment\nmay be made, unless it is further excepted (for example, bankruptcy or state\ntaxes). The following example demonstrates the principle. Pursuant to a\ngarnishment order for support, an employer withholds $90.00 a week from the\nwages of an employee who has disposable earnings of $240.00 a week. A\ngarnishment order for the collection of a retail credit debt is also served.\nThe sec 303(a)(l) limit for consumer debt garnishments of 25% applies to the retail\ndebt. Under the formula for consumer debts, a maximum of $60.00 (25% of\n$240.00) is garnishable. The $90.00 support payments may be withheld, because\nthe restrictions of sec 303(a) do not apply to court orders for support. No\nconsumer debt garnishment may be made, because the amount already garnished is\nmore than the amount that may be withheld under sec 303(a)(l). Additional\nwithholdings could be made for those purposes listed in sec 303(b).",
