  "text": "(a)  \nTo qualify for exemption under 29 U.S.C. § 213(a)(1), employees\ngenerally must be paid not less than $455/wk “on a salary basis.”  However,\nthese salary requirements do not apply to outside sales employees (29 CFR\n§ 541.500(c)), teachers (29 CFR § 541.303(d)), or employees practicing law\nor medicine (29 CFR § 541.304).  Exempt computer employees may be paid either\non a salary or fee basis at not less than $455/wk or on an hourly basis at not\nless than $27.63/hour (29 CFR § 541.400(b)). (b)  \nBeing paid “on a salary basis” means that the employee\nregularly receives a predetermined amount of compensation each pay period on a\nweekly, or less frequent, basis and the predetermined amount cannot be subject\nto reduction because of variations in either the quality or the quantity of\nwork performed by the employee.  Except for seven exceptions specifically cited\nin the regulations (29 CFR § 541.602(b)(1) through (7)), an exempt employee\nmust receive the full salary for any week in which the employee performs any\nwork, regardless of the number of days or hours worked.  If the employer makes\ndeductions from the employee’s predetermined salary because of the operating\nrequirements of the business or absences caused by the employer, the employee\nis not paid “on a salary basis.”  If an exempt employee is ready, willing and\nable to work, deductions may not be made for time when work is not available. \nHowever, exempt employees need not be paid for any workweek in which they\nperform no work. 29\nCFR § 541.602(a) WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2005-01  (c)  \nThe regulations contain seven exceptions to the salary\nbasis “no pay-docking” rule (29 CFR § 541.602(b)(1) - (7)). Employers may\nmake deductions from the salaries of exempt employees in the following\ncircumstances: (1)  When the\nemployee is absent from work for one or more full days for personal reasons,\nother than sickness or disability – if an exempt employee is absent for one and\na half days for personal reasons, the employer may deduct only for the one\nfull-day absence;  29 CFR §\n541.602(b)(1) (2)  When the\nemployee is absent from work for one or more full days due to sickness or\ndisability (including work-related accidents) if the deduction is made\naccording to a bona fide plan, policy or practice of providing compensation for\nloss of salary for these types of absences, including under a State disability\ninsurance law or State workers’ compensation law (the employer is not required\nto pay any portion of the employee’s salary for full-day absences for which the\nemployee receives compensation under the plan, policy, or practice, or for full-day\nabsences before the employee has qualified under the plan, policy or practice\nand after the employee has exhausted the leave allowance thereunder); 29 CFR §\n541.602(b)(2)  (3)  While an\nemployer cannot make deductions from an exempt employee’s salary for absences\ncaused by jury duty, attendance as a witness or temporary military leave, the\nemployer may offset any amounts received by an employee as jury fees, witness\nfees or military pay for a particular week against the salary due for that\nparticular week;  29 CFR § 541.602(b)(3)\n (4)  For penalties\nimposed in good faith for infractions of safety rules of “major significance”\nincluding those related to preventing serious danger in the workplace or to\nemployees, such as “no smoking” rules in explosive plants, oil refineries and\ncoal mines; 29 CFR §\n541.602(b)(4)  (5)  For unpaid\ndisciplinary suspensions of one or more full days imposed in good faith\npursuant to a written policy applicable to all employees for infractions of\nworkplace misconduct rules (e.g., written policies prohibiting sexual\nharassment, violence in the workplace, drug or alcohol violations, or\nviolations of state or federal laws -  i.e. serious workplace misconduct issues,\nnot performance or attendance issues);  29 CFR §\n541.602(b)(5)  (6)  An employer may\npay a proportionate part of an exempt employee’s salary for the time actually\nworked in the initial and final weeks of employment (but employees are not paid\non a salary basis if they are employed occasionally for a few days at a time\nand the employer pays them a proportionate part of the weekly salary when so\nemployed); and 29 CFR §\n541.602(b)(6)  (7)  When an\nemployee takes unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, the\nemployer may pay a proportionate part of the full salary for time actually\nworked. 29 CFR §\n541.602(b)(7)           29 CFR § 825.206 (d) \nFull-day vs. partial-day deductions. Certain\ndeductions permitted under the regulations may be taken only for “one or more full\ndays” of absence.  This language means a deduction may be taken from the salary\nonly in full-day increments.  Deductions for partial-day absences violate the\nsalary basis rule generally, except those occurring in the first or final\nweeks of employment (29 CFR § 541.602(b)(6)) or for unpaid leave taken\nunder the Family and Medical Leave Act (29 CFR §541.602(b)(7)).  Thus, for\nexample, if an employee is absent for one and a half days to handle personal\naffairs, the employer may only deduct for the one full-day absence.  The\nemployee must receive a full day’s pay for the partial day worked to satisfy\nthe “salary basis” rule.  A deduction from pay as a penalty for violations of\nmajor safety rules under 29 CFR § 541.602(b)(4) may be made in any amount. 29\nCFR § 541.602(b), 541.602(c) (e)  \n  (1)  Common\npractices that do not violate the salary basis rule Certain common\npayroll and recordkeeping practices do not bring into question whether someone\nis paid on a salary basis including, e.g., taking deductions from an exempt\nemployee’s accrued leave accounts (regardless of whether to cover partial-day\nor full-day absences); requiring exempt employees to keep track of and/or\nrecord their hours worked; requiring exempt employees to work a specified\nschedule of hours; and implementing bona fide, across-the-board changes in\nschedules. 69 FR 22178 through\n22179 (2)  Leave banks Where an employer\nhas adopted a vacation leave and sick leave policy or plan, or a plan providing\nemployees leave to attend children’s school activities, or to transport family\nmembers to routine medical appointments, it is permissible for the employer to\nsubstitute or reduce the accrued leave in the plan for the time that an exempt\nsalaried employee is absent from work even if it is less than a full day\nwithout affecting the salary basis of payment, if by substituting or reducing\nsuch “leave bank” the employee continues to receive payment of an amount equal\nto the employee’s guaranteed salary.  However, if an exempt employee is absent\nfor less than a full day, the employee must still receive payment of the full\nguaranteed salary even if the employee has no accrued benefits in the “leave\nbank” or if the employee’s account has a negative balance.  According to\n§ 541.602(b)(1), the employer may deduct from the salary of an exempt\nemployee for being absent a full day for personal reasons. The employee’s\nexempt status, however, would not be affected if the employer chooses to pay a\nportion of the daily equivalent salary when the employee has insufficient leave\navailable to cover the full-day absence (e.g., an employer applies the last\nremaining four hours of leave in an employee’s “leave bank” which only\npartially covers the full-day, eight-hour absence). WHD Opinion Letter FLSA\n2005-07 WHD Opinion Letter FLSA\n2007-06",
