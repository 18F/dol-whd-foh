  "text": "(a)           \nThe government of a State, that is, all the departments and\nagencies of any of the 50 States, constitutes a single employer under the Act.\nSimilarly, the government of a political subdivision, e.g., county, city, etc.,\nwith all of its departments and agencies, constitutes a single employer under\nthe Act. However, such entities are separate and distinct from the government\nof the State and from other political subdivisions. Thus, for example, where an\nemployee works for more than one agency of the State government, or for more\nthan one agency of a political subdivision, such employee’s employment is by a\nsingle employer. Each agency is both individually and coequally responsible for\ncompliance with all applicable provisions of the Act with respect to such employee.\nHowever, see FOH 59d. (b)           \nPolitical subdivisions (see FOH 10c05) and interstate agencies\nhave traditionally been recognized as entities separate and distinct from the\ngovernment of the State.",
