  "text": "(a)   Employees of a wholesaler who are engaged in the\nprocurement and receipt of goods from outside the State are engaged in\ninterstate commerce without regard to the nature of the employer’s business or\nthe subsequent disposition of the goods. This is true whether the goods are\nreceived by the wholesaler or directly by the customer on behalf of whom they\nwere procured to be shipped. Included within the coverage of the FLSA on this\nbasis are employees whose work is so closely related to the actual procurement\nor receipt of the goods as to be, for all practical purposes, a part thereof.\nFor example, employees who keep records of interstate purchases and goods\nreceived, maintain the accounts payable ledger, and other allied and receiving\nemployees, are so closely related to the interstate movement of the goods as to\nbe engaged in interstate commerce. Moreover, maintenance and custodial\nemployees of such a wholesale establishment are covered on an individual basis\nfor similar reasons. For example, maintenance employees engaged in repairing\nthe materials-handling equipment, the watchman who protects goods prior to\nunloading, and the janitor who cleans the office of the wholesaler are likewise\nso closely related to the movement of the goods ordered and received as to be\nengaged in interstate commerce. (b)   The coverage of the employees whose activities are\nperformed with respect to the out-of-State goods while such goods are in or\nabout the establishment of the wholesaler is determined by the status of the\ngoods at the time of the performance of the activity in question. If at that\ntime the goods are in fact still in the stream of interstate commerce,\nperformance of work connected therewith by any employee will be either actual\nengagement in interstate commerce or so closely related thereto as to be\nregarded as part thereof.",
