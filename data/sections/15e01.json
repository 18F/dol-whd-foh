  "text": "(a)   An apprentice (29 CFR § 5.2(n)(l)) is (1) any person\nemployed under a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State\napprenticeship agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor,\nEmployment and Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship Training,\nEmployer and Labor Services (OA), or if no such recognized agency exists in a\nState, under a program registered with the OA itself, or, (2) a person in the\nfirst 90 days of probationary employment as an apprentice in such an approved\napprenticeship program who is not individually registered in the program, but\nwho has been certified by OA or a State apprenticeship agency (as appropriate)\nto be eligible for probationary employment as an apprentice. All apprentices\nother than probationary apprentices must be individually registered in the\napproved program. Consistent with the level of training in the program, an\napprentice will perform for the appropriate period of time all levels of work,\nfrom the lowest unskilled laborer’s work to the highest skilled or craft work\nof the finished mechanic, under the supervision of the journeyworker. To be\nemployed in compliance with the Regulations the following guidelines must be\nobserved: (b)  Allowable ratio - apprentices to journeyworkers. (1) \nThe allowable ratio of apprentices\nto journeyworkers employed on the contract work in any craft classification\nwill not be greater than the ratio permitted the contractor as to the entire\nwork force under the registered program. (See 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i).) The\nallowable ratio is to be applied on a daily basis. If a contractor has both an\napprentice and a trainee program, the trainees must be counted together with\nthe apprentices in determining compliance with the allowable ratio (i.e., the\njourneyworkers may not be counted twice). (2) \nFor the purpose of illustration\nonly, assume that a contractor is allowed a ratio of one apprentice to every\nthree journeyworkers under the terms of the approved plan. This same ratio\nwould apply on DBRA covered jobs. Thus, in this example, the allowable number\nof apprentices is illustrated by the following chart: \n\n\n \n  \n  Journeyworkers\n  \n  \n  Allowable\n  Apprentices\n  \n \n \n  \n  0-2\n  \n  \n  0\n  \n \n \n  \n  3-5\n  \n  \n  1\n  \n \n \n  \n  6-8\n  \n  \n  2\n  \n \n \n  \n  9-11\n  \n  \n  3\n  \n \n\n\n NOTE: The ratios are applied in terms of whole number\nincrements for the journeyworkers (as reflected in the preceding chart) and not\nin terms of “fractions thereof,” unless a different standard is specified in\nthe approved plan. Also, the allowable ratio will vary from plan to plan. (3) \nRecognizing that the DBRA work may\nbe performed in a location other than the place where the program registration\nwas initially made, the allowable ratio is the ratio specified in the\ncontractor’s or subcontractor’s registered program (see 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i)). (4) \nA working supervisor or owner may\nbe counted as a journeyworker for ratio purposes provided such a worker spends\nthe majority of his or her time in the craft, at the site. (5) \nIn determining the proper ratios,\n“bootstrapping” is not allowed. For example, if an employer has employees who\nare misclassified and determined to be entitled to the journeyworker’s rate or\nhas utilized an excessive number of apprentices who are also entitled to the\njourneyworker’s rate, such employees cannot then be counted as “journeyworker”\nfor ratio purposes. (c)   Registered apprentice ratio exceeded. If a contractor or\nsubcontractor employs apprentices in such a number that the permissible ratio\nis exceeded, all apprentices employed in excess of the ratio are considered to\nhave been improperly employed and will be entitled to the rate for the\nclassification of work which they are performing. For example, if an employer\nis permitted to employ three apprentices under an approved plan and it is\ndisclosed that the employer is employing five apprentices on the project, the\nfirst three apprentices employed on the project will be considered within the\nquota; the last two employed will be considered improperly employed and must be\npaid the full prevailing wage rate for the work performed. As a practical\nmatter, if it is impossible to determine which apprentices were first employed\non the project, any equitable formula for allocating the time due at the\napplicable prevailing wage rate will be acceptable. For example, in the\npreceding situation, it would be permissible and equitable to rotate three of\nthe five apprentices each week as a solution to the problem of which of these\nemployees were “first” employed on the project. The remaining two employees\nwould then be allocated the full prevailing wage rate in a manner which\ndistributes the time improperly employed as equally as possible. (d)  Evidence of bona fide apprenticeship registration. 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(3)(i)\nrequires that a contractor or subcontractor utilizing apprentices maintain\nwritten evidence of the registration of the program and the apprentices, and of\nthe ratios and wage rates prescribed in the applicable programs. (e)   Unregistered apprentices. 29 CFR § 5.5(a)(4)(i)\nprovides that any employee listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate who\nis not a bona fide registered or probationary apprentice must be paid the wage\nrate for the classification of work actually performed. However, the fact that\na worker is listed on the payrolls as an apprentice in a particular craft and\npaid an apprentice wage rate for that craft does not, in itself, mean that\nperson performed only the work of, or used only the tools of, the craft in\nwhich the person is an unregistered apprentice, and it does not mean that the\nworker must be compensated only at the contract rate for that craft\nclassification. Such an employee may actually be performing work as a laborer\nor in another craft classification, and must receive at least the rate\napplicable for the classification(s) of work actually performed. (f)   Employment of apprentices by more than one employer. Employment of a properly\nregistered apprentice by more than one employer does not affect his/her status.\nThe transfer of apprentices from one employer to another to provide varied work\nand training is an accepted construction industry practice. (g)   Wage computations for apprentices. In some instances, bona fide\napprenticeship programs contain percentages which are applied to a stipulated\nwage rate (e.g., stated in the approved apprenticeship program or set forth in\na collective bargaining agreement), the product of which results in the wage\nrate paid to the apprentice. While such a computation is acceptable on\nconstruction projects not subject to the DBRA, the contractor on covered\nprojects is bound by any higher wage rates in the WD and the percentages should\nbe computed against the journeyworker’s basic rate found in the WD. Some\napprenticeship agreements may specify dollar amounts, rather than percentages\nof the journeyworker’s rate, for various levels of progress. For this type of\napprenticeship training program, in order to determine whether the apprentice\nis properly paid it is necessary to convert the dollar amounts to a percentage\nof the journeyworker’s basic rate in the training program. This is then applied\nto the rate specified in the WD. For example, where the journeyworker’s rate\ncontained in the apprenticeship training program for a particular craft is\n$16.00 per hour and the apprentices are to receive $8.00, $10.00, $12.00, or\n$14.00, depending on their level of progress, the percentages to be applied against\nthe journeyworker’s rate in the WD should be 50%, 63%, 75%, and 88%,\nrespectively. In addition, the apprentices are also entitled to receive fringe\nbenefits in accordance with the provisions of the apprenticeship program. If\nthe approved program is silent as to fringe benefits, apprentices must be paid\nthe full amount of fringe benefits listed in the WD for their classification,\nunless the Administrator determines that a different practice prevails in the\nlocality of the construction project for that particular apprentice\nclassification.",
