  "text": "Name: \nCoal Mine Occupations Originally\nAdopted:  September 1, 1940 (a) Scope of HO 3 (1)  The report that established HO 3 found accident rates\n(including death and dismemberment) for adults employed in and about coal mines\nfar exceed accident rates in other industries.  This report did not address\nlong term occupational illnesses such as “black lung.”  As of the last census\nbefore the report was issued (1930), three per cent of workers employed in coal\nmines were under the age of eighteen (approximately 16,000 minors).  Typically,\nif employed underground, the young people worked as “miner’s helpers” loading\ncoal, or as “trappers” or “door boys” opening and closing doors (regulating air\nflow) to allow the passage of coal cars.  If employed above ground, they worked\nas slate pickers, as helpers in repair shops, or in general clean up work.  The\nreport concluded that the risk of injury to youths employed in coal mines was\ngreat due to the rate of accidents involving adults, and due to their lack of\nexperience and good judgment. (2)  HO 3 is industry specific.  Its scope includes all\ntypes of work performed in or about an underground mine, an open-pit (strip)\nmine, or at the surface part of the mining plant that contributes to the\nextraction, grading, cleaning, or other handling of coal.  The scope of this\norder does not cover slate or refuse picking at certain designated areas, and\nwork solely in offices, or in repair and maintenance shops located in the\nsurface area of any coal-mining plant. (3)  Definitions a.    \nCoal shall mean any rank of coal,\nincluding lignite, bituminous, and anthracite coals. 1.    \nLignite coal is a brownish-black\ncoal intermediate between peat and bituminous coal. 2.    \nBituminous coal is of medium age\n(geologically).  It is “soft” and after burning it leaves bitumen—a tar like\nsubstance.  It makes up the majority of the coal reserves in the United States. 3.    \nAnthracite coal is the oldest coal\n(geologically).  It is “hard” and burns clean.  It is found almost exclusively\nin Pennsylvania. b.    \nThe term occupation in or about\nany coal mine shall mean all types of work performed in any underground\nworking, open-pit, or surface part of any coal mining plant, that contribute to\nthe extraction, grading, cleaning, or other handling of coal. c.    \nThe term tipple refers to a place\nwhere, or an apparatus by which, cars of coal are loaded or emptied. (b) Occupations PROHIBITED (1)  All work in underground coal mines, such as:  miner,\nminer’s helper, loader, shearing-machine operator, loading-machine operator,\ndriller, shot firer, motorman, trackman, or timberman, etc. (2)  All work in an open pit coal mine, such as:  miner,\nshovel operator, electrician, etc. (3)  All work on the surface part of an underground or\nopen-pit mine (or mining plant) except that permitted in FOH 33h03(c). (c) Occupations NOT SPECIFICALLY BANNED On\nthe surface part of the coal mining plant, 16 and 17 year olds may: (1)  Engage in slate or other refuse picking at a picking\ntable, or at a picking chute in a tipple or a breaker. (2)  Engage in occupations where the work occurs solely in offices,\nor in repair or maintenance shops (which are located above ground). (d) Enforcement positions (1)  Stock clerk working on the premises of a coal mine   This\noccupation is prohibited for 16- or 17-year-olds if it involves moving about\nthe mine premises delivering supplies, crossing railroad tracks, being in the\nvicinity of loading chutes, or otherwise working outside of the warehouse. \nConversely, this work is permitted if it is confined solely to the warehouse\nstructure on the surface part of the mining plant. (2)  Motor-vehicle operator and outside helper HO 3\nprohibits almost all work in or about a mine, which would include the\noccupations of motor-vehicle driver and outside helper.  HO 2 also specifically\nprohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from performing the occupations of motor-vehicle\ndriver and outside helper in or about any mine, including open pit mine or\nquarry.   (3)  Cleaning under a coal tipple or breaker This\nwork is prohibited by HO 3, as is the pining of railroad cars onto the main\nspur track, and the cleaning of railroad cars. (4)  Watchman HO 3\nprohibits 16 or 17 year olds from working as watchmen if they work in or about\nthe surface part of the mining operation (i.e., working around\nrailroad tracks, loading chutes, etc.).  However, if the area where the work is\nperformed is sufficiently removed (one mile or more) from the site of the\nmining operation, then it would not be work “in or about a mine,” and such work\nwould be permissible for 16 and 17 year olds.  For example, 16 or 17 year olds\nmay work as watchmen at the front gate of the mine, or at an office, if they\nare located more than one mile from the site of the mining operation. (5)  Surveying Surveying\nwork to plan future mining fields that is done well in advance of any mining\noperation and at least one mile from current mining operations is not work in\nthe “surface part of any coal mining plant.”  Consequently, such work is\npermitted for 16- and 17-year-olds. (6)  Screening Coal The\nscreening of coal is an occupation prohibited by HO 3. (e) Exemptions There\nare no provisions in HO 3 for apprentices or student-learners.  There are no\nother exemptions applicable to this order.",
