  "text": "An\nextended workweek schedule is a definite schedule of hours longer than the\nregular workweek for a temporary period (e.g., a month or more).  For example,\nan employee who is normally scheduled to work an eight-hour day, five-day\nworkweek may be scheduled to work five days of nine hours or six eight-hour\ndays.  (A change in the workweek that is intended to be (or in fact is)\npermanent is not an extended workweek schedule as discussed herein.) Because\nthe payment of extra compensation to a bona fide exempt employee for working an\nextended schedule is an addition to, rather than a part of, the employee’s\npredetermined salary, deductions of all or part of the extra compensation when\nthe employee fails to work the full extended workweek schedule will not be regarded\nas a deduction from the employee’s predetermined salary. This assumes that the\nextra compensation is bona fide and is not paid to facilitate otherwise\nprohibited deductions from the guaranteed salary.",
