  "text": "(a)  \n(FLSA Sec 7 (a) requires that an\nemployee receive compensation for OT hours at “a rate not less than one and\none-half times the regular rate at which he/she is employed”. Where board,\nlodging, and facilities are charged to the employee and the employer recovers\nthe amount by deductions from the employee’s cash wages, the regular rate is\ndetermined before the deductions are made. There is no limit to the amount\nwhich may be deducted for these items, provided that the deductions are\nconfined to the reasonable cost of the board and lodging furnished. Where such\ndeductions are in amounts which exceed the “reasonable cost”, the excess amount\nshall be handled the same as deductions for items other than “board, lodging,\nor other facilities”. The term “other facilities” means such items as meals\nfurnished at company restaurants, housing furnished, general merchandise bought\nat company stores (including food, clothing, and household effects), and fuel,\nelectricity, water, and gas furnished for the personal use of the employee. (b)  \nEmployers must pay\nstatutorily-required MW and OT premium pay finally and unconditionally, or\n“free and clear.” The cost of furnishing items that are primarily for the\nbenefit or convenience of the employer do not qualify as “facilities” under\nFLSA section 3(m); thus they may not be included as part of wages due. \nFurther, deductions for articles that do not qualify as “board, lodging, or\nother facilities” under FLSA section 3(m), such as tools, equipment, cash\nregister shortages, and other similar items, may not be made if they cut into\nrequired MW or OT premium pay. Deductions that reduce an employee’s average\nhourly earnings for the workweek after the deductions to less than the highest applicable\nMW rate are illegal in an OT week unless the law establishing that MW (e.g.,\nState law, DBRA, SCA, H-2A, H-1B, H-2B, or a MSPA contracted “promised wage”)\nallows the particular deduction. (NOTE: If a MSPA contract specifically\ndiscloses that the employer will make certain particularized deductions not\nother prohibited by other law, those deductions would be permitted. For\nexample, if a MSPA-covered employer disclosed a wage rate of $8.00/hour and\nfully disclosed in writing at the time of recruitment that $1.50/hour would be\ndeducted for non-3(m) items, and the deductions are otherwise legal and not\nprohibited by other applicable laws, then those fully-disclosed deductions are\npermitted to reduce the hourly wage to below the $8.00/hour contracted “promised\nwage” (i.e. to $6.50/hour). Deductions for non-3(m) items may be made in an OT\nworkweek to the same extent as permitted in a non-OT workweek if their purpose\nand effect are not to evade the OT requirements of the FLSA or other law, and\nif they are bona fide deductions made for particular items according to a prior\nagreement or understanding between the employer and the employee before the\nwork is performed (Regs 531.37(a) and 778.315). (c)  \nIf an employer and an employee\nhave an express or implied agreement about a deduction policy for particular\nitems, then bona fide deductions pursuant to the policy will be allowed during\nan OT workweek to the extent that they would be allowed in a non-OT workweek,\nprovided that the deductions do not violate other applicable laws (e.g., State\nlaw), the employee receives “free and clear” the highest applicable MW\n(including prevailing wages) required by any Federal, State or local law for\nthe non-OT hours, and the employee receives time and one-half the regular rate\nof pay based on the stipulated wage, before any deductions are made, for all\nthe OT hours. For example, if a forestry worker subject to a $9.00 per hour SCA\nprevailing WD is paid $10.00 per hour ($1.00 above the legally-required SCA WD\nrate of $9.00) and works 50 hours in a particular workweek, the most that may\nbe deducted from this worker’s wages for that week pursuant to a prior\nagreement covering specific deductions (e.g. purchase of a saw) is 40 times\n$1.00 ($40.00). (Statutory wages due net after deductions = [40x$9.00 ($360.00\nMW]+[(10 x 1.50 x $10.00 ($150.00 OT)] or $510.00 total MW & OT.) (d)  \nUnless there is an agreement as to\ndeductions for particular items, or if the employer reduces an employee’s wages\nfor a reason not addressed in the contractual arrangement or for no legitimate\nreason, the deductions will be considered illegal and will not be allowed\nduring OT workweeks. To determine if these criteria are met, apply the\nfollowing standards: (1)  Deductions must be made for particular items according\nto an agreement or understanding between the parties:  The agreement must be\nreached before the employee performs the work that becomes subject to the\ndeductions. The agreement must be specific concerning the particular items for\nwhich the deductions will be made, and the employee must know how the amount of\nthe deductions will be determined that are included in the agreement (e.g.,\ncash register shortages). The employee must affirmatively agree or assent to\nthe employer’s deduction policy. While the employee’s assent to the policy may\nbe written or unwritten, the employer bears the burden of proof that an\nemployee has agreed to the deduction policy. (2)  Only bona fide deductions, made for particular items,\nare permitted:  Deductions that are otherwise prohibited by other laws or\nauthority (Federal, State or local) are not bona fide (e.g., if a State law\nprohibits any deductions from employees’ wages for tools and similar items or\nequipment that are business expenses of the employer, WH would not allow any\ndeductions in that State in an OT workweek, regardless of whether the highest\nWH-enforced MW was paid (net) after the deductions). Deductions for amounts\nabove the reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing a particular item to an\nemployee are also not bona fide (e.g., furnishing items to employees “at a\nprofit”; deductions for substandard housing). Deductions from wages where no\nprior agreement exists as to particular items are never permitted in an OT\nworkweek. (3)  The regular rate of pay is based on the stipulated\nwage before any deductions are made:  Deductions for non-3(m) items that reduce\nan employee’s rate of pay to below the highest applicable legally-required MW\nare illegal unless the law establishing that MW allows the particular\ndeductions. In OT workweeks (where OT requirements apply), deductions may be\nmade according to an agreement that reduce the effective hourly rate down to\nthe highest required MW, but only from the non-OT hours (first 40 hours in the\nweek). Proper time and one-half the full regular rate (pre-deductions) must be\npaid for all statutory OT hours. (4)  The purpose and effect of the deductions are not to\nevade the OT requirements or other laws: Deductions made only in OT workweeks,\nor increases in prices charged during OT workweeks compared to non-OT\nworkweeks, will be considered manipulations to evade statutory OT requirements\nwhich are prohibited. Deductions that violate other applicable laws are\nprohibited in an OT workweek. (See Regs 531.37(a) and 778.315.)",
