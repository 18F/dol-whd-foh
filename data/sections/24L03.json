  "text": "(a)   The statutory language of Sec 13(b)(10)\nboth prior to and subsequent to 5/1/74 limits the exemption to the specified\nemployees of nonmanufacturing establishments primarily engaged in the business of\nselling automobiles, trailers, trucks, farm implements (boats effective 5/1/74)\nor aircraft to ultimate purchasers. It does not apply to employees of\nautomobile parts and accessories wholesalers, retail auto parts stores,\nautomotive repair garages or other establishments not primarily engaged in\nselling the named vehicles. (b)   In the case of dealerships in the named\nvehicles it will not be necessary, where departments functionally operated as\npart of the dealership are at different locations, to determine whether they\nare parts of the main establishment or physical places of business qualifying\nas separate establishments under the customary tests. A specific legislative\nintent to include all such parts of the dealership’s business as one\nestablishment for purposes of Sec 13(b)(10) is made plain by statements in the\nlegislative history that the exemption is intended to apply to the named\nclasses of employees employed by a dealership in the described vehicles “even\nif they work in physically separate buildings or areas, or even if, though\nworking in the principal building of the dealership, their work relates to the\nwork of physically separate buildings or areas, so long as they are employed in\na department which is functionally operated as part of the dealership”. Thus,\nfor example, if a new car dealer operates a used car lot at a different\nlocation, employees who work at that lot may qualify for the exemption if the\nused car lot is operated as a part of the dealership.
