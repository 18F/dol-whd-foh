  "text": "(a)   Section\n6(a)(4) of FLSA permits an employer to calculate wages for seamen on the basis\nof a period longer than a w/w. For example, wages for such employees may be\ncalculated over a longer period, such as for the entire voyage, on a monthly\nbasis, or, in appropriate cases, on a yearly basis. In those cases where wages\nare calculated on other than a weekly basis, it is the responsibility of the\nemployer to demonstrate that a pay period of such duration is in accordance\nwith the established custom of the industry. In addition, the employee must\nreceive wages at not less than a rate which will provide, for the period\ncovered by the wage payments, wages equal to the MW for all hours during such\nperiod when the employee is on duty. Thus, if a seaman is paid a monthly\nsalary, the total hours worked in the month, divided into the salary, must\nyield at least the MW, regardless of the varying number of hours worked during\nthe weeks in the month. The same principle would apply if the wages were\ncomputed on the basis of an entire voyage or on a yearly basis. (b)   It is the\ncustom of some employers in the maritime industry to pay by the month or by the\nvoyage but, for the convenience of the employees, to make two or more partial\npayments rather than a single payment covering the period involved. For example,\nmonthly compensation may be disbursed in two partial payments (semi-monthly),\nor partial payments may be made weekly on the basis of 1/52nd of the annual pay\nderived by multiplying 12 times the monthly salary. Such arrangements do not\naffect the principles stated in (a) above.",
