  "text": "(a)   Processing incidental to retail selling of goods or\nservices is not a manufacturing activity. For example, a grocery store may\ngrind coffee; a drug store may prepare prescriptions; a restaurant may process\nfood; a clothing store may make alterations on suits; or a repair garage may\ngrind valves. The applicability of a retail or service exemption to the\nestablishment or to the individual employees is not affected by the performance\nof such processing activities which are incidental to retail selling or\nservicing. (b)  Work performed on the customer’s own goods where the\ncompleted job will not result in the creation of a different product from that\nwhich the customer brought in will be considered as “services” for purposes of\nthe retail or service exemptions, and, if recognized in the particular industry\nas retail services, will be considered as such for purposes of determining the\napplicability of the exemption. For example, the recapping of a tire for a\ncustomer, the upholstering of a chair for a customer, the repairing of an\nautomobile for a customer regardless of the degree of repairs, the rebuilding\nof a pair of shoes for a customer, or the rebuilding of a typewriter for a\ncustomer, are regarded as the performance of services for purposes of the\napplication of the retail or service establishment exemptions. Where, however,\nthe job would result in the creation of a different product from that which the\ncustomer brought in such as, for example, where a truck or a bus is made out of\nthe customer’s automobile, or where a suit of clothes is made out of a piece of\ncloth the customer brought in, the activity of making the truck, the bus, or\nthe suit of clothes is a manufacturing activity and employees engaged in such\nactivities, to be exempt, must qualify under Sec 13(a)(4). (c)   If the activity is not performed on the customer’s own\ngoods as in (b) above but is performed for commercial purposes, as for example,\nwhere old tires are purchased by an establishment and recapped for purposes of\nsale, or old typewriters are purchased and rebuilt for purposes of sale, or old\nfurniture is purchased and reupholstered for purposes of sale, the\nmanufacturing involved in these operations would not constitute a “service” for\npurposes of the retail and service exemptions. To be exempt, employees engaged\nin these activities must qualify for exemption under Sec 13(a)(4).",
