Colleges generally would qualify as educational establishments for\npurposes of the teacher exemption.  An “educational establishment” is defined\nas “an elementary or secondary school system, an institution of higher learning\nor other educational institution.”  Where\nAAIs spend more than 50% of their time teaching in an educational\nestablishment,  they qualify for exemption from the FLSA’s minimum wage and\novertime pay requirements.
