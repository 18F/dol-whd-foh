After thus\ndetermining the workweek to which the overlapping work time shall be allocated,\nthe remaining workweek shall be treated as one in which the only compensable\nworktime is that falling exclusively within that workweek and outside the\nportion which overlaps the other workweek. Subject to this modification, the\ncompensation due an employee for straight-time and for overtime on a daily or\nweekly basis shall be computed and paid for each workweek as in workweeks when\nno overlap occurs.",
