Where the employees carry current issues of the newspaper and\nattempt to sell them as part of their solicitation work, such employment is\nconsidered to be within the Sec 13(d) exemption. The work can reasonably be\nregarded as involving the street sale of newspapers to the consumer. (b)  However, the solicitation of\nnewspaper subscriptions for delivery by a person other than the soliciting\nemployee would not be exempt work under Sec 13(d). The solicitation of\nnewspaper subscriptions for delivery by other persons (newsboys) does not\nconstitute work relating to the newsboy’s delivery of newspapers to the\nconsumer. Nevertheless, the possible application of the Reg 541.5 exemption\nshould not be overlooked. The work may be permissible under CL Reg 3 provided\nit complies with the conditions of that Reg.",
