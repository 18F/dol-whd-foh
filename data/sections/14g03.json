  "text": "(a)   The basic principles for determining hours worked by a\ntruck driver on duty for 24 hours or more as set forth in FOH 31b09 and 31b12\nare applicable to SCA mail haul truck drivers.  (b)  Time during which an employee is considered on or off\nduty by the Department of Transportation is not governed by the same principles\nas apply under the FLSA. The DOT’s regulations are concerned primarily with the\nsafe operation of the vehicle and not compensable hours worked. Thus, the off-duty\ntime required by DOT for safety purposes may exceed the amount of sleep time or\nother non-working time that may be deducted pursuant to FOH 31b09 or 31b12. (c)   The principles set forth in FLSA 29 C.F.R. 785.14\nthrough 785.22 must be applied to determine whether layover or breakdown time\nis hours worked. Where such time is compensable hours worked and occurs on an\nSCA contract, it must be paid at a rate not less than the applicable SCA WD\nrate for drivers since such time is intrinsically related to contract work. If\na contractor chooses to pay for layover and breakdown time, which would\notherwise not be considered hours worked under FLSA 29 C.F.R. 785, for the\npurpose of not breaking a driver’s continuous tour of duty on tours of 24 hours\nor more, then such time must also be paid at the applicable SCA WD rate. (d)  WH considers the totality of the circumstances in\ndetermining whether layover or breakdown time is hours worked. Small remote\ntowns with few amenities often do not provide an opportunity for an employee to\nuse the time effectively for his own purposes. In such cases, the layover or\nbreakdown time would be considered hours worked and compensation must be no\nless than the SCA WD rate. (e)   Overtime exemption applicable to mail haul contracts.   Section 13(b)(1) of the FLSA\nprovides an overtime exemption for employees who are within the authority of\nthe Secretary of Transportation to establish qualifications and maximum hours\nof service pursuant to Section 204 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935. On June\n14, 1972, the Department of Transportation published a notice in the Federal\nRegister (37 Fed. Reg. 11781) asserting its power to establish qualifications\nand maximum hours of service for contract mail haulers who operate in\ninterstate or foreign commerce. The FLSA’s § 13(b)(1)\nexemption may therefore apply to certain employees of contract mail haulers,\nprovided the tests for that exemption are met. See 29 C.F.R. § 782.8(b). Note,\nhowever, that drivers, driver’s helpers, loaders, and mechanics, whose duties\naffect the safety of operation of a vehicle engaged in transportation on public\nhighways in interstate or foreign commerce and who would otherwise satisfy the\nexemption, are nonetheless required to be paid overtime compensation if the\nvehicle used for mail haul purposes weighs 10,000 pounds or less. This is known\nas the “small vehicle exception” to the motor carrier exemption. The small\nvehicle exception applies and overtime pay is due to an employee in any\nworkweek when the employee’s work, “in whole or in part,” affects the safety of\noperation of a small vehicle. The phrase “in whole or in part” means an\nemployee who performs such duties involving small vehicles for the entire week\nor part of the week must receive overtime pay for hours worked over 40 in that\nworkweek. Note that the small vehicle exception\nwill not apply to certain vehicles A) designed or used to transport more than 8\npassengers (including driver) for compensation, B) designed or used to\ntransport more than 15 passengers (including driver) and not used to transport\npassengers for compensation, or C) used in transporting hazardous material\nrequiring placarding under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of\nTransportation. See Fact Sheet #19 and FAB 2010-2. (f)   In addition, the CWHSSA exempts all Federal contracts\n\"for transportation by land, air or water\" from its provisions for\novertime pay. The overtime provisions of this statute would also not apply to\nemployees working on USPS mail hauling contracts. (See 40 U.S.C. 3701(b)(3);\nFOH 15i00(2) & 15i01(c).) (g)   Applicable wage rate. The wage rate applicable to\nmail haul truck drivers is based upon the point of origin of the route required\nby the contract. This point of origin is commonly referred to as the “head out”\npoint. The “head out” rate is applicable to all drivers who work on the\ncontract regardless of where they may start their portion of the route.",
