  "text": "(a)   The term “wage determination” includes the original\ndecision and any subsequent decisions modifying, superseding, correcting, or\notherwise changing the provisions of the original decision. (b)  There are four basic categories of WDs based on the\ntype of construction (see AAM#130 and AAM #131): Building: Sheltered\nenclosures with walk-in access for the purpose of housing persons, machinery,\nequipment or supplies. This category includes all construction of such\nstructures, the installation of equipment, as well as incidental grading and\npaving. Such structures need not be “habitable” to be building construction.\nExamples of “building” construction projects are auditoriums, city halls,\napartment buildings (five stories and above), hospitals, office buildings,\nschools, warehouses, and shopping centers. Residential: Single family\nhouses or apartment buildings of four stories or less. Highway: Alteration or\nrepair of roads, streets, highways, runways, alleys, trails, paths, parking\nareas, and other similar projects not incidental to building or heavy\nconstruction. Heavy: This is a catch-all\ncategory. It includes all other projects not classified as building, highway or\nresidential (e.g. bridges over navigable waters, dams, dredging and irrigation\nprojects, tunnels). Of the four categories of construction, this is the only\ntype of construction that can be broken into subcategories such as water and\nsewer line projects and dredging projects.  A project which includes\nelements of two or more types of construction normally requires multiple wage\ndeterminations if such category of construction is “substantial” (i.e. greater\nthan 20% of project costs or greater than $1,000,000).  (c)   General wage determinations. General WDs are published at\nhttp://www.wdol.gov. (d)  Project wage determinations. Project WDs are issued in\nresponse to specific requests from contracting agencies when there is no\ngeneral WD applicable to the type of construction in the geographical area for\nthe project involved.",
