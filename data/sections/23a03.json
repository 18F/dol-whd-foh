If the situation is one where the purported\nseparate publications are properly to be regarded as one and the same newspaper,\nthe total circulation of both newspapers would have to be considered in\ndetermining whether the exemption applies. If the two publications, in addition\nto their different mastheads, carry different local news items, the\npublications should be considered as two different newspapers in testing for\nthe exemption under Sec 13(a)(8).",
