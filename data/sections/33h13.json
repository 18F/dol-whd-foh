  "text": "Name:  Occupations Involved in the Manufacture of Brick, Tile, and\nKindred Products Originally Adopted:  September 1, 1956 (a)  \nScope of HO 13 (1)  The rate of injuries in the clay/silica construction\nproducts industry (as determined by the report establishing HO 13) exceeded the\ninjury rate (including serious injuries) found in the majority of manufacturing\nestablishments.  The report attributed the higher frequency of worker injuries\nin this industry to:  lifting, carrying, and pushing heavy objects; bricks\nfalling on workers from stacks or out of the workers’ hands onto themselves,\nvehicle—pedestrian accidents, machine injuries, and falls caused by slippery\nfloors.  The report recommended that a Hazardous Occupations Order be created\nto ban the employment of minors in most occupations in the clay/silica\nconstruction products industry. (2)  HO 13 is industry specific.  It applies to all work in\nor about plants manufacturing clay construction products – except work in the\ndrying departments of plants manufacturing sewer pipe, in storage and shipping,\nin offices, in laboratories, and in storerooms.  It also applies to work in or\nabout plants manufacturing silica brick, or other silica refractories, except\nwork in offices. (3)  Definitions a.    \nThe term clay construction\nproducts includes the following:  brick, hollow structural tile, sewer pipe and\nkindred products, refractories, and other clay products, such as: \narchitectural terra cotta, glazed structural tile, roofing tile, stove lining,\nchimney pipes and tops, wall coping, and drain tile.  The term does not include\nnon-structural clay products, such as ceramic floor and wall tile, mosaic tile,\nglazed and enameled tile, faience and similar tile.  Nor does the term include\nnon-clay construction products such as sand-lime brick, glass brick, or\nnon-clay refractories. b.    \nThe term silica brick or other\nsilica refractories means refractory products produced from raw materials\ncontaining free silica as their main constituent. c.    \nThe terms drawing and wheeling\nshall mean the process of removing brick, after it has cooled, from the kiln to\nstorage. (b)  \nOccupations PROHIBITED (1)  All occupations (except those permitted in\nFOH 33h13(c)(1)) in or about establishments engaged in manufacturing clay\nconstruction products.  Examples of prohibited occupations/machines include: \ncrushers, granulators, dry pans, and screens; storage bin work; operators of\npug mills, auger or extrusion machines; cutting machines; hackers; car pushers;\nsewer pipe press crew; brick forming machine crew; glaziers; setters, tossers;\nburners; and drawers.   (2)  All work/occupations (except in offices) in\nestablishments engaged in manufacturing silica brick or other silica\nrefractories. (c)  \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED (1)  The following are permissible occupations for\nestablishments in the clay construction products industry: a.    \nWork in storage and shipping. b.    \nWork in offices. c.    \nWork in the drying departments of\nplants manufacturing sewer pipe. (2)  Work in offices in establishments manufacturing silica\nbrick or other silica refractories. (d)  \nExemptions There are no provisions in HO 13 for apprentices or student-learners. \nThere are no other exemptions applicable to this order.   (e)  \nEnforcement positions (1)  Glazing of cylinders Work in and about a\nplant where silica, lime, and asbestos are mixed together to form a glaze\n(subsequently used to coat the inside of cylinders) is work prohibited by HO\n13.  The glaze contains free silica as a main constituent; consequently, the\narea where it is produced meets the definition of an establishment where silica\nrefractories are manufactured (see 29 CFR 570.64(a)(2) and\n570.64(b)(2)).  In light of the preceding, work in or about such an\nestablishment is prohibited. (2)  Asbestos Asbestos is a form of\nmagnesium silicate; however, it does not contain any free silica.  Since it does\nnot contain free silica, establishments manufacturing asbestos are not making a\nsilica refractory and are not covered by HO 13. (3)  Shipping and storage of brick a.    \nPreparing bricks for storage,\ninside the manufacturing building and adjacent to the kilns (even after the\nbricks have been removed from the kiln and placed on flat cars), is work\ncovered by HO 13.  For example: stacking the bricks on skids, and strapping\nthem down in order to move them to a storage area outside the building, is work\nconsidered to be within the drawing and wheeling department and not within the\npurview of storage and shipping. b.    \nRemoving bricks from inside the\nkiln in the process of loading them or moving them to storage, is not work in\nstorage and shipping, and therefore is covered by HO 13. (4)  Clay drain tile The setting and\ndrawing of tile in clay drain tile plant is prohibited by HO 13.",
