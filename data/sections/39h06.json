The military member’s active duty\norders or other military documentation need only be provided to the employer\nonce.  An employer may subsequently require an employee to provide a copy of\nnew active duty order or other military documentation only for a qualifying\nexigency request arising out of a different period of covered active duty of\nthe same military member or the covered active duty of a different military\nmember.29 USC 2613(f)29 CFR 825.309(a)77 FR 8960, 897078 FR 8854 – 8855 (b)   Additional\ncertification An employer may\nrequire that leave for any qualifying exigency be supported by a certification\nthat provides the dates, description, and other details of the exigency and the\nneeded leave.  An employer may request the following information for qualifying\nexigency certification: (1)  A statement or\ndescription, signed by the employee, of appropriate facts regarding the\nqualifying exigency, including information on the type of qualifying exigency\nfor which leave is requested, and, if available, any written documentation that\nsupports the need for leave, (2)  The approximate\ndate on which the qualifying exigency commenced or will commence, (3)  The beginning\nand ending dates for leave taken for a single, continuous period of time, (4)  The estimated\nfrequency and duration of the qualifying exigency for leave taken \nintermittently or on a reduced leave schedule, and (5)  If the\nqualifying exigency involves a meeting with a third party, appropriate contact\ninformation for the individual or entity with whom the employee plans to meet (e.g.,\nname, title, organization, address, telephone number, fax number, and email\naddress) and a brief description of the purpose of the meeting. An employer may use\nthe DOL’s optional Form WH-384 for obtaining this certification.  An employer\nwho uses Form WH-384 or another form containing the same basic information may\nnot require any information beyond that specified in the regulations. 29 CFR 825.309(b) and\n(c) (c)   Rest and Recuperation\nleave orders If the qualifying\nexigency leave is to spend time with the military member while he or she is on\nRest and Recuperation leave, an employer may request a copy of the member’s\nRest and Recuperation orders or other documentation issued by the military\nwhich states the military member had been granted Rest and Recuperation leave and\nthe dates.  See FOH 39d08(b)(6). 29 CFR 825.309(b)(6) (d)   Verification Once an employee\nsubmits a complete and sufficient certification, the employer may not request\nadditional information.  If the exigency involves meeting with a third party,\nthe employer may contact the individual or entity only to verify the purpose\nand schedule of the meeting.  An employer may also contact an appropriate unit\nof the Department of Defense only to request verification that a military\nmember is on covered active or call to covered active duty status.  The\nemployer does not need the employee’s permission for verification. 29 CFR 825.309(d) (e)   Second\nand third opinions and recertifications The second and third\nopinion process applicable to certification of a serious health condition (see\nFOH 39h01(e)) does not apply to qualifying exigency leave as such leave does\nnot involve a serious health condition.  Recertification is not permitted for\nleave taken for the same qualifying exigency. 29 CFR 825.313(c)",
