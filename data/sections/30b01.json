  "text": "(a)   Since the\nnumber of regularly scheduled work hours may be greater in long months than in\nshort months, the strict allocation of a regular monthly salary to the hours\nworked within each month may result in a technical MW violation in the longer\nmonths. However, for enforcement purposes, a regular monthly salary of $580.67\nshall be considered as equivalent to a weekly wage of $134.00 and accepted as\ncompliance with the $3.35 MW requirement if it is compensation for 40 hours of\nwork or less in the w/w. If the employer rounds out this amount to not more\nthan $585.00 per month, this will not affect the regular rate (i.e., $3.35) for\nOT purposes. (b)   Where an\nemployee is paid a salary for a period in excess of a w/w (for example, on a\nmonthly or semi-monthly basis) and works an alternating schedule of fixed\nw/w’s, and an equal allocation of the salary would result in payment of less\nthan the MW for the long w/w’s, there will be compliance with the MW provisions\nof FLSA provided: (1)  the salary is\nsufficient to meet the MW requirements for all hours worked during the pay\nperiod; and (2)  there is an\nagreement or understanding between the parties that a larger portion of the\nsalary is to be allocated to the longer w/w’s. The employer shall be advised\nthat the firm’s records should properly reflect the allocation of the salary on\na w/w basis.",
