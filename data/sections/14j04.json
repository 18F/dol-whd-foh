  "text": "(a)   Most prevailing WDs list a specific number of named\nholidays for which payment is required. A full-time employee who is eligible to\nreceive payment for a named holiday must receive a full day’s pay up to 8 hours\nunless a different standard is used in the WD, such as one reflecting CBA\nbenefit requirements. A full-time employee who works on the day designated as a\nholiday must be paid, in addition to the amount he/she ordinarily would be\nentitled to for that day’s work, the cash equivalent of a full-day’s pay up to\n8 hours, or be furnished another day off with pay. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.174(c)(1)-(2).) (b)  An employee’s entitlement to holiday pay fully vests\nby working in the w/w in which the named holiday occurs. Accordingly, any\nemployee who is terminated before receiving the full amount of holiday benefits\ndue must be paid the holiday benefits as a final cash payment. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.174(c)(4).)  (c)   If the applicable WD does not include a paid holiday\nprovision for any day declared by the U.S. President to be a holiday, or for\nany work day where the Federal facility is closed such as due to inclement\nweather, the contractor is not required to pay covered service employees who\ntake that day off. Any pay provided would be a matter of discretion for the\ncontractor, and contract payments for such time not worked would be a\nprocurement matter within the purview of the contracting agency.",
