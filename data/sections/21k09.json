  "text": "(a)   General guidance in defining “restaurant” is contained\nin IB 779.387. A “restaurant” may be further identified as an establishment\nengaged in serving prepared food and beverages selected by the patron from a\nfull menu. Waiter or waitress service is usually provided (except in some\ncafeterias) and the establishment has dining (seating) facilities and\nequipment. Thus, establishments known as cafes, cafeterias, coffee shops,\ndiners, dining rooms, lunchrooms, tea rooms, etc., may qualify as\n“restaurants”. (b)  There are many types of retail establishments that\nsell prepared food or beverages for consumption on the premises or for\nimmediate consumption that are clearly not “restaurants”, such as drinking\nplaces, social caterers, and ice cream and frozen custard stands. This\ndistinction is not so readily apparent with respect to establishments, such as\nquick-service food establishments, primarily engaged in selling limited lines\nof refreshments and prepared food items, such as hamburgers, fried and\nbarbecued chicken, pizza, etc., for consumption on or near the premises or for\n“take-home” consumption. Such establishments range from “carryouts”, which have\nno seating facilities and cannot qualify as “restaurants”, to establishments\nthat have tables and booths, parking for eating in one’s car, and “take-home”\ncontainers. Whether a quick-service food establishment is a “restaurant”\npursuant to Sec 13(b)(8) depends on the facts in a particular situation. Such\nquick-service food establishments that do not provide the characteristic\nemployee services and the physical and functional equipment and furnishings\nthat patrons require for consumption of meals on the premises are not\n“restaurants” for purposes of Sec 13(b)(8). On the other hand, where a\nparticular quick-service food establishment does provide the customary employee\nand dining room services, pursuant to the above and IB 779.387, WH will not\ndeny the exemption. As in cafeterias, the fact that waiters and waitresses may\nnot be employed would not alter this position. The present examples in IB\n779.387 of “refreshment stands” and “lunch counters” should be interpreted in\nthe light of and consistent with the discussion above. (c)   The case of Foodservice and Lodging Institute. Inc..\net al. v. Dunlop which challenged the above position, has been tried in the\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. On 9/30/75, the court stated\nthat it appeared the plaintiffs (Institute, et al.) “failed to establish that\nthe ruling and opinion letter challenged herein are plainly unreasonable or in\nconflict with the intent of Congress . . . .“ The Court granted the Secretary’s\nmotion for Summary Judgment and denied Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief\nand dismissed the case with prejudice. The Institute has filed a Notice of\nAppeal on the case, however. If the Department prevails in the appeal process,\nthe Institute will not be able to raise this challenge on its merits again.\nThey will have to wait for a specific case to try the issues. WH will continue\nto apply such exemptions under the guidelines of FOH 21k09 and IB 779.387. (d)  The “on the premises” test referred to above does not\nnecessarily mean a physical structure. For example, a garden restaurant or\nsidewalk cafe could qualify as a restaurant if it provides the customary\nemployee and dining room services and facilities. (e)   Where the patrons of a drive-in food service\nestablishment with no seating facilities are served in their cars, the\nestablishment is not a restaurant within the meaning of the exemption.",
