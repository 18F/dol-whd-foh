  "text": "(a)  \nAlthough 29 CFR 570.33(h) prohibits minors 14 and 15 years of age\nfrom performing most cooking tasks, § 570.34(i) permits such minors to perform\noccupations involved in preparing and serving food and beverages, including\noperating machines used to perform such work.  Machines such youth are\npermitted to operate include, but are not limited to: (1)  Electric and gas grills that do not involve cooking\nthe product over an open flame, (2)  Deep fryers that utilize baskets to contain the food\nproduct being cooked and which are equipped with and utilize a device that\nautomatically lowers the basket into the hot oil or grease and automatically\nraises the basket out of the hot oil or grease, (3)  Dishwashers, (4)  Toasters (see FOH 33c12(b)(2)), (5)  Dumbwaiters if limited to kitchen work involving the\npreparation and serving of food, (6)  Popcorn poppers, (7)  Milk shake blenders, including blenders used to make\n“smoothies,” frapuccinos, and fruit drinks, (8)  Coffee grinders, (9)  Automatic coffee machines, including espresso and\ncappuccino machines (see 75 FR 28409), (10)  Devices used to maintain the temperature of prepared\nfoods, such as warmers, steam tables, and heat lamps (even if the temperature\nexceeds 140 °F), (11)  Microwave ovens that are used only to warm prepared\nfood and do not have the capacity to warm above 140 °F, (12)  Cotton candy machines (see FOH\n33c12(b)(6)), and (13)  “Sno Cone,” “Snow Cone,” and Italian ice machines (see\nFOH 33c12(b)(9)). (b)  \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds are\nprohibited from operating many other pieces of power-driven equipment used in\nkitchens and food service establishments.  Below are specific pieces of\npower-driven kitchen equipment that are cited in the regulations or upon which\nWH has formally opined. (1)  Toasters.  29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and\n15-year-old minors to operate certain machines, including toasters.   a.    \nWH has long interpreted the term\ntoaster to mean that type of equipment that was generally found in snack bars\nand lunch counters when CL Reg 3 was issued and used to toast such items as\nslices of bread and English muffins.  This includes such equipment as the two-\nor four-slice “pop-up” toasters similar to those manufactured for home use and\nthe small conveyor-type bread toasters now often found at self-service\nbreakfast buffets (see 75 FR 28409).   b.    \nBroilers, automatic broiler\nsystems, high speed ovens, and rapid toaster machines used at quick service\nrestaurants to toast such items as buns, bagels, and muffins—all of which\noperate at high temperatures, often in excess of 500 degrees Fahrenheit—are not\ntoasters under CL Reg 3 and minors must be at least 16 years of age to operate\nthem (see 75 FR 28409).  One rapid toaster that 14- and 15-year-olds are not\npermitted to operate is the Model VCT-200.  (2)  Broilers, including Automatic Broiler Systems   a.    \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds are\nprohibited from performing all baking activities, including operating most\novens, and from cooking with all broilers.  Some electric and gas grills that\nhave solid cooking surfaces on top, are also equipped with a broiler under the\ngrill that takes advantage of the single source of heat (electric element or\ngas flame).  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds may cook with such grills, but may not\nuse the broilers. b.    \nAutomatic Broiler Systems (see\n29 CFR 570.34(c)).  Fourteen and fifteen year olds are prohibited from\noperating automatic broilers and cooking systems, such as those produced by the\nNeico Automatic Broilers.  NEICO broilers – also called Flexi-Chef® Cooking\nSystems – and other automatic broiler systems use a combination of convection\nand radiant heat to flame broil a wide variety of items.  These items include\nribs, chicken, steak, hamburgers, seafood, nachos, vegetables and breadsticks. \nAutomatic broilers, which can be powered by electric, natural gas, or propane,\noften operate at temperatures in excess of 500 °F.   1.    \nAutomatic broilers may operate\nusing a conveyor or system of conveyors.  The product is simply placed on the\nconveyor at the feed-end and it flows through to the discharge-end, flame\nbroiled on both sides at the same time.   2.    \nOn some systems, called\nreturn-flow broilers, the product is both fed and returned on the same end of\nthe broiler.  Some automatic broilers also feature up to four independently\ntimed conveyor belts, allowing the user to broil up to four separate items at\nthe same time.  The broilers may also have a “meat holding unit” for limited\nproduct holding after broiling and a “bun-grill” for toasting buns.   3.    \nEnforcement experience indicates\nthat these automatic broilers are used in a variety of food service\nestablishments.  (3)  Rotisseries (see 29 CFR 570.34(c)).  A\nrotisserie is a device that cooks food while it slowly rotates.  Heating\nsources may be electricity, gas, charcoal, or wood.  A rotisserie contains a\nspit fitted with a pair of prongs that slide along its length. Food (usually\nmeat) is impaled on the spit and the prongs (which are inserted on each side of\nthe food) are screwed tightly into place to hold the food securely. Modern\nrotisseries have a motor that automatically turns the shaft, while their\npredecessors relied on human power.   a.    \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds are\nprohibited from cooking with rotisseries.   b.    \nNot included in the CL Reg 3\nprohibition regarding the operation of rotisseries would be those pieces of\nequipment, often used at movie theaters, amusement parks, and snack bars, that\nheat and maintain the temperature of pre-cooked hot dogs and sausages.  Such\npermitted pieces of equipment include “roller grills” consisting of a\nhorizontal surface composed of a series or rotating cylinders upon which the\nhot dogs are heated and “rotisserie cabinets” where the hot dogs are placed on\n“spikes” or “cradles” and then “orbit” around or past a heat source. (4)  Power-driven food slicers, grinders, choppers, and\nmixers  29\nCFR 570.33(e) prohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from performing occupations\nwhich involve operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or\nrepairing power-driven food slicers and grinders, food choppers, food\nprocessors, food cutters, and food mixers.   a.    \nThese occupations are prohibited\nunder CL Reg 3 regardless of the material being processed by such machines. \nThis prohibition is much broader than that contained in HO 10 (see 75 FR\n28409). b.    \nPower-driven bagel slicers are\nfood slicers under CL Reg 3 and are therefore prohibited.  This prohibition is\nmuch broader than that contained in HO 14 and the enforcement position\ndiscussed in FOH 33h11(e). c.    \nBakery-type mixers  1.    \nCL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and\n15-year-olds from operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling,\nor repairing power-driven food mixers regardless of the product being\nprocessed, the size of the mixer, or the blade or attachment being used.  This\nprohibition is much broader than that imposed by HO 11, Occupations involved in\nthe operation of bakery machines. 2.    \nAlthough HO 11 (see 29 CFR\n570.62(b)(1)) provides an exception that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to operate\ncertain lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top power-driven food\nmixers, this exception does not apply to those under 16 years of age (see\nFOH 33h11(d)(2)d).   d.    \nDairy Queen Blizzard Flavor Treat\nMachine/Whisper Quiet Mix-N-Blend Machine   The\n“Blizzard,” a trademarked product of Dairy Queen, is made from soft ice cream. \nAlthough somewhat similar to a milk shake, the Blizzard is very thick and\ncannot be poured.  The customer selects ingredients, such as chocolate, fruit,\nor different kinds of candy, to be added to the soft ice cream.  All the\ningredients are placed in a cup and then blended or mixed by the Blizzard\nmachine.  Because these machines act as a milk shake blender, a machine\nspecifically permitted by 29 CFR 570.34(i), 14- and 15-year-olds may\noperate both the Dairy Queen Blizzard Flavor Treat machine or the Whisper Quiet\nMix-N-Blend Machine.   (5)  Cotton candy machines.  CL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14-\nand 15-year-olds from operating most standard cotton candy machines. a.    \nThe operator of the cotton candy\nmachine puts sugar crystals into a cylinder in the center of the machine.  The\nsugar crystals are heated by hot air from an enclosed element to a soft liquid\nconsistency.  The liquid sugar is then spun out into a fluff that collects\nwithin the bowl of the machine.  The operator takes a cardboard cone and twirls\nit around just inside the surface of the bowl picking up the spun cotton candy\nuntil the cone is filled to a serving size.   b.    \n29 CFR 570.34(i) permits 14- and\n15-year-old-minors to perform kitchen work and other work involved in preparing\nand serving food and beverages, including the operation of machines and devices\nused in the performance of such work, such as but not limited to, dishwashers,\ntoasters, dumbwaiters, popcorn poppers, milk shake blenders, and coffee\ngrinders. 1.    \nMost cotton candy machines are\ndesigned in such a manner to present few hazards to the operator, and the\noperator is exposed to none of the moving parts of the machine.   2.    \nThis machine operates in a fashion\nsimilar to a popcorn popper, which is a permitted piece of equipment. (6)  Waffle irons a.    \nCL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14- and\n15-year-olds from cooking with electric waffle irons, including those used in\nrestaurants and ice cream shops to make “waffle cones.”  These waffle irons are\nsimilar to electric grills, with solid heating elements powered by\nelectricity.  They do not involve cooking over an open flame, do not operate at\nextremely high temperatures, and their operation does not constitute “baking”\nunder 29 CFR 570.33(h). b.    \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds may\nalso clean such waffle irons as long as the equipment and surfaces do not\nexceed a temperature of 100 °F (see 29 CFR 570.34(i)).  (7)  Two-sided grills a.    \nCL Reg 3 does not prohibit 14- and\n15-year-olds from cooking with electric or gas two-sided grills such as those\nmanufactured by Garland Commercial Industries under the name Master Series\nXpress Grills.  This equipment consists of a standard gas or electric grill\nthat is equipped with electric platen heaters that can be lowered\n(automatically or manually) onto the food product to allow for two-sided\ncooking.  Such equipment operates similar to a waffle iron. b.    \nFourteen- and 15-year-olds may\nalso clean such two-sided grills as long as the equipment and surfaces do not\nexceed a temperature of 100 °F (see 29 CFR 570.34(i)).  (8)  Ice chippers, grinders and shavers a.    \nCL Reg 3 prohibits 14- and\n15-year-olds from operating and tending most power-driven machinery used to\ngrind or shave ice.  Such machines are often used in restaurants, grocery\nstores, concession stands, amusement parks, and industrial settings to process\nice.  They range greatly in size, horsepower, and the amount of ice they can\nprocess per hour. b.    \n“Sno Cone,” “Snow Cone,” and\n“Italian Ice” Machines  1.    \nWH will not, however, assert a\nviolation of CL Reg 3 when 14- and 15-year-olds operate ice grinders and\nshavers that are designed and used to produce “sno cones,” “snow cones,” and\n“Italian ice”—products that consist of a single serving of ice which is then covered\nwith flavored syrup.  These machines are designed in such a manner to present\nfew hazards to the operator, and it appears that the operator is exposed to\nnone of the moving parts of the machine.   2.    \nMachines included under this\nenforcement position are often found at concession stands at parks, theaters,\nswimming pools, fairs, and other amusement venues.  The machines may be free\nstanding units, table top units, or contained in specially constructed\nsnow-cone carts.   3.    \nIce grinding and shaving machines\nincluded under this enforcement position may be electric, gas, or battery\noperated, but the horsepower of the motors may not exceed ½ horsepower.  The\nmaximum output of such machines may not exceed 500 pounds of “snow” per hour. 4.    \nWH will not charge a violation\nwhen 14- and 15-year-olds operate the ice grinding and shaving equipment\ndescribed in this subsection.  They may also perform limited tending functions\nsuch as loading ice into the machine, cleaning the exterior of the machine, and\ncleaning the compartment that holds the crushed or shaved ice.  Such youth may\nnot assemble or disassemble the machine or perform any work that entails\ncontact with moving parts that grind or shave the ice. 5.    \nManufacturers whose equipment have\nbeen found to meet the requirements of this enforcement position include\nSnoKonette models 1002, 1003, 1203, 1803, and 1903; Paragon models PA-6133110,\nPA-6133210, and PA-6133410; Echols models GWP-1360, GWP-117, GWP-103, and\nGWP-123.",
