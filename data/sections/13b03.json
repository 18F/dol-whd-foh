  "text": "(a)   General. Contracts in the\npetroleum industry may be awarded to a refiner that also operates its own\ndistribution facilities and makes deliveries pursuant to a PCA contract from\nthese facilities. In such cases, it is the position of Wage-Hour that the\nquestion of whether such a contractor is a “manufacturer” or “regular dealer”\nshould be determined upon a realistic evaluation of all pertinent factors such\nas the contract itself, the contractor’s operations and the obligations\nactually assumed for the fulfillment of the contract requirements. Thus, for\nexample, where such a refiner is awarded a contract and makes deliveries to the\nGovernment from a central distributing plant of products obtained from its own\nrefineries, it will be considered to have been awarded the contract as a\nrefiner and the rules in (b) below will apply to the contract. On the other\nhand, if such a refiner makes deliveries to the Government through its own\ndistribution facilities, but the products are actually received from other\nrefineries, it will generally be considered to have been awarded the contract\nas a dealer and the rules in (c) below will apply. If there is any question as\nto whether the refiner is operating as a “manufacturer” or as a “regular dealer”\nwith respect to a particular contract, and compliance depends on this issue,\nthe facts shall be obtained and submitted through channels to the RS for\nopinion. (b)  Refiners. If a refiner is\nawarded a contract as a manufacturer, only the employees at the refinery are\ncovered by the PCA. (See R&I No. 3, Sec 40(d).) Consequently, in such cases\ntruck drivers making deliveries to the Government from bulk stations rather\nthan from the refinery itself and other bulk station employees performing work\nin connection with the delivery of products to the Government are not covered\nby the PCA. (c)   Dealers. (1)  As provided in R&I No. 3, Sec 40(e)(1), where the\ncontractor is a dealer the PCA applies to employees at the “central\ndistributing plant” of the dealer who are employed in connection with the\nstorage and handling of petroleum products prior to delivery to the Government.\nA central distributing plant within the meaning of Sec 40(e)(1) is a dealer’s\nplace or places of business where it initially receives products from its\nsuppliers which are to be furnished to the Government, where its distribution\noperations thereon commence and from which the products are delivered either\ndirectly to the Government or to other plants for such delivery. (2)  Depending upon the size and scope of its operations a\ndealer may have at least one and sometimes more than one central distributing\nplant. For example, where a dealer has only a single establishment and products\nare received from suppliers for delivery to the Government from such establishment,\nthe single establishment constitutes the employer’s central distributing plant.\nSimilarly, where an employer has two or more establishments at which he or she\ninitially receives products from his or her suppliers for delivery either\ndirectly to the Government or to other plants for delivery to the Government,\nsuch establishments at which the products are initially received constitute\ncentral distribution plants. Where products are delivered from such a central\ndistributing plant to other plants of the employer for delivery to the\nGovernment, the latter plants represent “bulk stations” as that term is defined\nin R&I No. 3, Sec 40(e)(1). (d)  Service station employees. R&I No. 3, Sec\n40(b)(1) provides that although the PCA stipulations are included in the\ncontract, such stipulations are inapplicable to employees working at service\nstations. As used in this section the term “service stations” includes\nestablishments, whether owned or operated by the contractor or some other\nperson, engaged in selling fuel to operators of automotive vehicles, aircraft\nand watercraft and is not the same as “gasoline service establishment” as used\nin FLSA Sec 3(s)(5) or “gasoline service station” as used in old sec 13(b)(8). (e)   Oil production on Government property. Employees of a firm\nwho are engaged in the production of crude oil from wells on property which is\nwholly or partially owned by the Government, as in the instance of the Naval\nPetroleum Reserve, are producing goods rather than furnishing services and\ntherefore covered by the PCA.",
