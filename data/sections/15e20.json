Under the United States Housing Act of 1937 and\nthe Housing Act of 1949, the “development of the project” coverage test is\nbroader and may also cover preliminary survey work. (b)  The determination as to whether certain members of\nsurvey crews are laborers or mechanics is a question of fact. Such a\ndetermination must take into account the actual duties performed. As a general\nmatter, members of the survey party who hold the leveling staff while\nmeasurements of distance and elevation are made, who help measure distance with\na surveyor chain or other device, who adjust and read instruments for\nmeasurement or who direct the work are not considered laborers or mechanics.\nHowever, a crew member who primarily does manual work, for example, clearing\nbrush, is a laborer and is covered for the time so spent.",
