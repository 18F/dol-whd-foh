  "text": "(a)   Costs incurred by a contractor or subcontractor for a\n“bona fide” apprenticeship program (i.e., a program registered with either a\nState apprenticeship agency recognized by ETA (OA) or by ETA (OA) itself) are\ncreditable under DBRA. Only the actual costs incurred for the training program,\nsuch as instruction, books, and tools or materials, may be credited. Where the\ncosts incurred exceed the amounts set forth in the applicable WD, the excess\ncost may be credited towards the contractor’s or subcontractor’s other\nprevailing wage obligations, but only to the extent of the actual costs of the\nprogram. (b)  The cost incurred for apprenticeship training for one\nclassification of laborer or mechanic may not be used to offset costs required\nto be incurred for another classification. For example, a contractor cannot\nclaim credit for apprenticeship training costs incurred for electricians to\nsatisfy the applicable WD apprentice training requirements for carpenters. (c)   Rather than contributing to apprenticeship training\nfunds on an hourly basis, some contractors contribute a lump sum in advance for\nthe annual cost of the program. It is permissible for a contractor to use such\na method of payment and the contractor should be given appropriate credit. For\nexample, a contractor may contribute a fee of $900 to enroll an employee in an\napprentice training program for carpenters. In order to determine the amount\nthe contractor may offset to meet this contribution, it is necessary to convert\nthe contribution to an hourly cash equivalent. The hourly cash equivalent would\nbe determined by dividing the cost by the total number of hours worked by\ncarpenters and carpenter apprentices (DBRA and nongovernment work) to which the\ncost is attributable. Since construction workers often do not work a full year\n(2,080 hours) the total hours worked by the contractor’s carpenters and\ncarpenter apprentices, if any, for the preceding calendar year will be\nconsidered as representative of a normal work year for purposes of the above\nformula. The hourly cash equivalent thus obtained would be the contractor’s\npermissible offset on DBRA covered work. In addition, the contractor’s cost may\nnot be offset over a period longer than the training period the cost was\nintended to cover. Thus, in this example, if the total hours worked by\ncarpenters and carpenters’ apprentices were 45,000 hours in the preceding\ncalendar year, the contractor would be entitled to a credit of $0.02 per hour\n($900 / 45,000) against the prevailing wage obligations for all carpenters and\ncarpenters’ apprentices working on the DBRA project.",
