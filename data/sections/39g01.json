  "text": "(a)   The\nemployer is responsible in all circumstances for designating leave as\nFMLA-qualifying once the employer has knowledge that the leave is being taken\nfor an FMLA-qualifying reason.  In any circumstance where the employer does not\nhave sufficient information about the employee’s reason for leave, the employer\nshould inquire further of the employee to determine whether leave is\npotentially FMLA-qualifying.  The employer’s determination on whether leave is\nFMLA-qualifying must be based only on information received from the employee or\nthe employee’s spokesperson.  Once the employer has acquired knowledge that the\nleave is being taken for a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employer must notify the\nemployee.  See FOH 39g00(d). (b)   Retroactive\ndesignation If the employer fails\nto designate leave timely (i.e., within five business days absent unusual\ncircumstances), the employer may retroactively designate leave as FMLA leave\nwith appropriate notice to the employee provided that the employer’s failure to\ntimely designate leave does not cause harm or injury to the employee.  In all\ncases where leave would qualify for FMLA protections, an employer and an\nemployee can mutually agree that leave be retroactively designated as FMLA\nleave. (c)   Disputes If there is a dispute\nbetween an employer and an employee as to whether leave qualifies as FMLA\nleave, it should be resolved through discussions between the employee and the\nemployer.  Such discussions and the decision must be documented. 29 CFR 825.301",
