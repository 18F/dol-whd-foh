  "text": "(a)   The application of the Act to a contract for drilling\nwork would turn upon whether the contract is one for “construction” of “public\nworks” within the meaning of the D-B Act. (b)  Exploratory drilling. Drilling, like excavating\ngenerally, is usually considered “construction” activity. The critical question\nis whether the holes which would be dug during the course of the exploratory\ndrilling would be “works” within the statutory term “public work”. The word\n“works” in the term “public work” refers typically to improvements, such as\nbuildings, canals, or roads, rather than mere progress or activity.\nConsequently, exploratory drilling for the purpose of obtaining data to be used\nin engineering studies and the planning of a project such as a dam and\nreservoir, the actual construction of which has not been authorized and for\nwhich funds have not yet been appropriated, would not be within the term “work”\nbecause it relates to an activity as distinguished from a project or\nimprovement. Also, the holes themselves,\nwhich are opened to obtain cores and which are subsequently to be filled in or\nabandoned, would not be “works” because they are not improvements. The products\nsought by the digging are the cores of the earth and not the holes themselves.\n(See also FOH 14d02.) In contrast, wells drilled to obtain a water supply for a\nmilitary base or a contract for digging of test holes which later may become\n“public works” or permit conversion to water wells, oil wells or other “public\nworks” are covered. (c)   Soil boring prior to or during construction for the\npurpose of setting foundations. Soil boring contracts are\nconsidered covered by the DBRA if they are directly related and incidental to,\nor an integral part of, the actual construction process. This is to be\ndistinguished from the situation where such contracts are for the formulation\nof engineering plans and specifications, designs, and the conduct of site\ninvestigations. The latter activities are regarded as preliminary work, and not\nas a part of the construction process. (Also see FOH 14d04.) (d)  Plugging of oil or gas wells. A contract which calls for\nthe plugging of oil or gas wells and the removal of above-ground equipment in\nconnection with the construction of a reservoir on land containing such wells\nwould be covered by the DBRA no matter whether the work is characterized as\ndemolition (the dismantling of the above-ground equipment), incidental to\nconstruction, or well drilling (the rerunning of the tubing and replacement of\nthe cement plugs).",
