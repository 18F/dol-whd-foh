  "text": "(a)   The term “one indebtedness” refers to a single debt,\nregardless of the number of levies made or the number of separate garnishment\nproceedings instituted in connection with the indebtedness. In cases of\ngarnishment after judgment, it is WH policy that the judgment itself is a\n“debt.” This debt may represent one or more claims of a single creditor or the\nclaims of several creditors who joined in the proceeding. Also, the protection\nagainst discharge is renewed with each employment since the new employer has\nnot been a garnishee with respect to that employee. (b)  As provided in paragraph (a) above, there is a\ndistinction between a single debt and the garnishment proceeding brought to\ncollect it. After a garnishment proceeding for one debt becomes effective, the\nlaw does not prohibit discharge if there is another garnishment proceeding\npursuant to a second debt. Such multiple garnishments need not be from\ndifferent creditors. They may be from the same or different creditors so long\nas they involve separate debts. All of the facts in the particular case must be\nconsidered, to determine whether there is more than one debt. Ordinarily, a\nseparate debt may be identified as the full amount of the debt represented by a\nsingle judgment. (c)   The distinction between a single debt and the\ngarnishment proceeding(s) brought to collect it has particular importance in\nstates only allowing garnishment of wages earned prior to the garnishment order\nbeing served, or that of future wages subject to a time limitation. In such states,\nthe judgment creditor may need to secure a number of garnishment orders to\ncollect the full amount of the single debt represented by a judgment. Sec\n304(a) prohibits discharge of an employee under such circumstances. (d)  An employee discharged after a second garnishment that\noccurred long after the first may have been discharged solely because of the\nsecond garnishment. As a rule of thumb, where the interval between successive\ngarnishments for separate debts exceeds one year WH will carefully scrutinize a\ndischarge from employment following the latest garnishment. A determination of\nwhether a violation of sec 304(a) exists must be based on all the facts and circumstances.\n(See FOH 52v13(b)(l).)",
