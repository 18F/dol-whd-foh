  "text": "Sec 303 establishes limits\non the amount of earnings available for garnishment. These limits are based on\ndisposable earnings. (See FOH 16b0l.) The CCPA sets three levels of protection\nfor earnings. The first category deals with consumer debts (these are all debts\nnot covered by the two other categories). The second concerns support payments\n(that is, child support and alimony). The final level pertains to debts owed\nfor federal and state taxes or personal bankruptcy. (a)   Garnishments for consumer debts must not exceed the\nlower of: (1) \n25 % of disposable earnings; or (2) \nThe amount by which disposable\nearnings exceed 30 times the minimum wage multiplied by the number of weeks or\nfraction thereof worked. (See FOH 16b02.) The following chart shows\nthe current maximum garnishment of disposable earnings for consumer debts. It\nis based on the $5.15 an hour minimum wage.
