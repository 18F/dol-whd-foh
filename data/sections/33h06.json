  "text": "Name:  Hazardous Occupations Order 6—Exposure to\nRadioactive Substances and to Ionizing Radiations.                          Originally\nAdopted:  May 1, 1942 (a)           \nScope of HO 6 (1)          \nMany deaths from radiation\npoisoning were reported in 1929.  A number of these cases involved young women\nwho were engaged in manufacturing luminous compounds.  Their exposure to radiation\nbegan before they were 18 years of age.  The hazards of radiation exposure have\nbeen found to be greater for young persons since they are less likely to\nexercise care to avoid contamination.  Moreover, according to the Occupational\nSafety and Health Division of the National Institute of Science and Technology,\nseveral studies have shown that radiation exposure caused more injury to\nrapidly growing and dividing cells than to mature cells.  The significant\nhealth risk connected with exposing young people to radiation is highlighted by\nthe fact that OSHA has recognized this risk by making it its only age specific\nstandard. (2)          \nHO 6 was issued to protect people\nunder the age of 18 from exposure to radiation in the workplace and it applies\nto manufacturing plants, storage facilities, hospitals, clinics, laboratories,\ndental offices, colleges and universities, and all other covered locations\nwhere there are X-ray machines or other sources of radiation contamination. (3)          \nHO 6 was issued before the\ndevelopment of atomic energy as a weapon during World War II and later as an\nenergy source.  Consequently, HO 6 does not address problems related to\nexposure to atomic energy.  Workers are protected from such hazards by\nregulations issued and enforced by the Department of Energy. (4)          \nHO 6 adopted as its tolerance to\nthe exposure to radioactive substance in the air the occupational standards\nestablished by the National Committee on Radiation Protection.   This tolerance\nwas set forth in the National Bureau of Standards Handbook No. 69 entitled:\nMaximum Permissible Body Burdens and Maximum Permissible Concentrations of\nRadionuclides in Air and in Water for Occupational Exposure.  The rules on\nannual intake of radiation were changed in 1993, and the maximum permissible\nconcentrations in the air for exposure have been replaced by what is known as\nthe “derived air concentration.”  These requirements, which do not apply to\nnaturally formed radiation or to medical radiation, are found in 10 CFR part\n20, Standards for Protection Against Radiation.(5)          \nDefinitionsa.             \nThe term self-luminous compound\nshall mean any mixture of phosphorescent material and radium, mesothorium, or\nother radioactive element.b.             \nThe term workroom shall include\nthe entire area bounded by walls of solid material and extending from floor to\nceiling.c.             \nThe term ionizing radiation shall\nmean alpha and beta particles, electrons, protons, neutrons, gamma and X-ray\nand all other radiations which produce ionizations directly or indirectly, but\ndoes not include electromagnetic radiations other than gamma and X-ray. (b)           \nOccupations PROHIBITED (1)          \nAny work in any workroom in which: a.             \nRadium is stored or used in the\nmanufacture of self-luminous compound, b.             \nSelf-luminous compound is made,\nprocessed or packaged, c.             \nSelf-luminous compound is stored,\nused or worked on, d.             \nIncandescent mantles are made from\nfabric and solutions containing thorium salts, or are processed or packaged, or e.             \nOther radioactive substances are\npresent in the air in average concentrations exceeding 10 percent of the\nmaximum permissible concentrations in the air recommended for occupational\nexposure by the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Exposure, as set\nforth in 10 CFR 20.1207.   (2)          \nAny other work which involves\nexposure to ionizing radiation in excess of 0.5 rem per year. (c)           \nOccupations NOT SPECIFICALLY\nBANNED    (1)          \nWork in medical facilities such as\nX-ray rooms and laboratories where exposure to ionizing radiation is less than\n0.5 rem per year.   (2)          \nWork involving exposure to\nnaturally-occurring radiation such as radiation in soil or sunlight radiation. (d)           \nExemptions  There\nare no provisions in HO 6 for apprentices or student-learners.  There are no\nother exemptions applicable to this order.   (e)           \nEnforcement positions(1)          \nCompliance with the National\nCommittee on Radiation Protection updates and clarifications of Handbook No.\n69, including compliance with the standards of 10 CFR part 20, is considered\ncompliance with the radiation exposure requirements of HO 6.(2)          \nAlthough HO 6 still applies, the\nmanufacture of products containing radium and radium compounds used to make\nself-luminous parts, such as but not limited to watch dials that glow at night,\nis no longer a problem.  This type of manufacturing was discontinued a number\nof years ago and seldom are any products manufactured using such lumination. \nWith regard to thorium salts used to make incandescent gas mantles such as\nthose used on Coleman Lanterns, this also is no longer an exposure problem. \nThe radiation level is so low on each mantle that one would have to concentrate\nhundreds of these mantles together to achieve an exposure level even\napproaching a health risk.",
