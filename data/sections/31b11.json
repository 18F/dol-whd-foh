  "text": "In\nsome instances an employee of a newspaper or radio or television station will\nread a particular book with the view to a possible book review story for use in\nthe newspaper or on the air. This presents no problem as to hours worked where\nthe reading is done in the course of the employee’s regular duties at the establishment\nor elsewhere at any time at the employer’s specific request. However, the\nreading may be done away from the employer’s establishment and outside duty\nhours, such as at the employee’s home in the evening, and on a speculative\nbasis - that is, with the thought that a book review might be prepared. In such\ncases there is a substantial question as to whether the reading was done for\nthe benefit of the employer or for the pleasure or information of the employee.\nIn such cases, WH will not assert that such reading is hours worked even though\nthe book is subsequently reviewed in the newspaper or on the air.",
