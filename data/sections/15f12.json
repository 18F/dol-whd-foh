  "text": "(a)   In determining cash equivalent credit for fringe\nbenefit payments, the period of time to be used is the period covered by the\ncontribution. For example, if an employer contributes to a hospitalization plan\non a weekly basis, the total hours worked (DBRA covered and noncovered) each\nweek by each employee should be divided into the contribution made by the\nemployer on behalf of each employee to determine the hourly cash equivalent for\nwhich the employer is entitled to take credit for each employee. If contributions\nare made biweekly, cash equivalents would be computed bi-weekly. If\ncontributions are made quarterly, cash equivalents would be computed quarterly,\netc. (b)  On occasion, a contractor or subcontractor may offset\nthe annual cost of a particular fringe benefit by converting such costs to an\nhourly cash equivalent. For example, the hourly cash equivalent may be\ndetermined by dividing the cost of the fringe benefit by the total number of\nworking hours (DBRA and noncovered) to which the cost is attributable. Total\nhours worked by employees must be used as a divisor to determine the rate of\ncontribution per hour, since employees may work on both DBRA and nongovernment\nwork during the year and employers are prohibited from using contributions made\nfor nongovernment work to discharge or offset their obligations on DBRA work\n(see FOH 15f11(b)). Note, however, that if the amount of contribution varies\nper employee, credit must be determined separately for the amount contributed\non behalf of each employee (FOH 15f11(c)). (c)   To illustrate the principles set out in (b), assume\nthat the annual cost of a pension program is $15,000. The total actual working\nhours (DBRA and nongovernment) are 15,000. Thus $15,000 / 15,000 hours = $1.00\nper hour cash equivalent. Since construction workers often do not work a full\nyear (2,080 hours), where the contractor makes annual payments in advance to cover\nthe coming year and actual hours worked will not be determinable until the\nclose of that year, the total hours worked by the DBRA-covered laborers,\nmechanics and apprentices, if any, for the preceding calendar year (or plan\nyear), will be considered as representative of a normal work year for purposes\nof the above formula. Similarly, where the contractor pays monthly health\ninsurance premiums in advance on a lump sum basis, the total actual hours\nworked in the previous month or in the same month in the previous year may be\nuse to determine (i.e., estimate) the hourly equivalent credit per employee\nduring the current month. Any representative period may be utilized in such\ncases, provided that the period selected is reasonable. Where the cost incurred\nincluded contributions for employees other than covered laborers, mechanics,\nand apprentices, the hours of such noncovered employees must be included in the\ncomputation of the hourly cash equivalent or the contributions for such\nemployees must be eliminated prior to determining the cash equivalent for\ncovered employees. (d)  In computing cash equivalents, it should be kept in\nmind that under certain kinds of fringe benefit plans the rate of contribution\nfor employees may vary. For example, under a hospitalization plan the employer\noften contributes at different rates for single and family plan members. In\nsuch situations, an employer cannot take an across the board average equivalent\nfor all employees; rather, the cash equivalent can only be credited based on\nthe rate of contributions for each individual employee.",
