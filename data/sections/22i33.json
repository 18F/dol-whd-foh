The RT’s primary duty does not require\n“advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a\nprolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.” Their work has been\nfound not to be “work which is predominantly intellectual in character, and\nwhich includes work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and\njudgment, as distinguished from performance of routine mental, manual,\nmechanical or physical work.” The\nRT position requires successful completion of a two-to-three-year radiology\ntechnology program accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in\nRadiologic Technology or some other manner of accreditation acceptable to the\nAmerican Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT).  The RTs must pass\nan ARRT examination for registration.  To renew the ARRT registration, an\nRT must meet certain continuing education requirements every two years. The\nrequirement that an RT complete a two- to three-year radiology technology\nprogram accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic\nTechnology (or some other manner of accreditation acceptable to the ARRT),\nalong with an ARRT examination for registration, does not meet the “advanced\nknowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged\ncourse of specialized intellectual instruction” standard. Duties\nof RT’s have been found to be: reviewing physicians’ orders for patient\nexaminations; ensuring that the examining room is properly prepared for the\nprocedure; visiting patients to determine their tolerance to the examination\nand positioning; preparing patient information cards that are included on the\nfilm for identification; positioning the patients to assure that the\nradiologist can see and access the proper area for the imaging procedure;\nadministering contrast and other chemicals orally or intravenously; setting\ntechnical factors on equipment, such as penetration and length of the imaging\npower; checking radiation and imaging power factors for safety to the patient,\ntechnologist, and equipment; and operating the equipment for radiation and\nother imaging power exposure.  RTs take the film to the darkroom for\nautomatic processing and evaluate the adequacy of the film for reading by the\nradiologist.  As needed, the RTs take additional images.  They may\nalso assist the radiologist in understanding particular cases and images\ntaken.  Following\nthe procedures, the RTs return patients to their proper area; clean tables and\nchange linens; clean cassettes, aprons, gloves, and wheelchairs; check\ncassettes for contact and leakage, and aprons and gloves for leakage; and clean\nthe film processor as required.  They ensure that proper notations are\nmade in the patients’ records, and participate in maintaining departmental\nfiles, coordinating and scheduling of patients, and maintaining department\ninventories.  The RTs maintain records of use according to state and\nfederal regulations.  They perform daily instrument calibration procedures\non all instruments, make minor repairs to equipment, and report any major\nequipment problems to the department head.  RTs carry out all of their\nduties without the need for constant supervision. Although\nthe RTs’ work involves the use of advanced skills and procedures that are\nvitally important to the professional work of the radiologist who analyzes and\ninterprets the images, the RTs’ work does not appear to be “work which is\npredominantly intellectual in character, and which includes work requiring the\nconsistent exercise of discretion and judgment, as distinguished from\nperformance of routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work.” \n29 CFR § 541.301(b).  The procedural work performed by the RTs\nis highly skilled and requires significant training, but seems to be more in\nthe character of routine mental, manual, mechanical and physical processes than\nintellectual work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and\njudgment.  The “learned professional” activity in this area is the\npractice of medicine involved in the analysis and interpretation of the images\ndeveloped, which is performed by the radiologist.
