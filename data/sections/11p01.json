It is not necessary that\nshipments to the bulk plants be based upon prior specific orders. The temporary\nstorage at the bulk plants is merely a convenient and intermediate step in the\nprocess of getting them to their final destination. (b)   Employees who transfer the products from tank cars to\nstorage tanks and delivery trucks for delivery to retail outlets are actually\nengaged in interstate commerce. Those engaged in the maintenance of the bulk\nplant equipment are also engaged in interstate commerce, since their activities\nof inspecting and servicing motors and pumps used to make the transfer are so\nclosely related to the movement of the petroleum products in interstate commerce\nas to be a part of the movement. Such bulk plants may be considered as fixed\nfacilities of interstate commerce.",
