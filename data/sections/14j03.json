  "text": "(a)   General. Eligibility for vacation\nbenefits specified in a prevailing WD is based on completion of a standard\nperiod of past service. The principles to be followed in determining an\nemployee’s length of service for vacation eligibility are summarized below.\n(See 29 C.F.R. 4.173.) (b)  Determining length of service. Most prevailing WDs require\nan employer to furnish employees a specified amount of paid vacation upon\ncompletion of a specific length of service with a contractor or successor;\ne.g., “one week paid vacation after one year of service with a contractor or\nsuccessor” or “one week’s paid vacation after one year of service.” Unless\nspecified otherwise in an applicable WD, the following two factors must be\ntaken into consideration in determining when an employee has completed the\nrequired length of service to be eligible for vacation benefits: (1) \nThe total length of time spent by\nan employee in the continuous service of the present (successor) contractor,\nincluding both the time spent performing commercial work and the time spent\nperforming on the Government contract(s) itself. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.173(a)(1)(i).) (2) \nWhere applicable, the total length\nof time spent in any capacity as an employee in the continuous service of any\npredecessor contractor(s) who carried out similar contract functions at the\nsame Federal facility. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(a)(1)(ii).) However, prior service as a\nFederal employee is not counted toward an employee’s eligibility for vacation\nbenefits under the applicable WD. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(a)(3).)  (c)   Eligibility requirement - continuous service. Under the principles set\nforth above, if an employee’s total length of service adds up to at least one\nyear, the employee is eligible for the specified amount of vacation with pay\nprovided in the WD. The term “continuous service” does not require the\ncombination of two entirely separate periods of employment where there has been\na break in service. Whether or not there is a break in the continuity of\nservice so as to make an employee ineligible for a vacation benefit is\ndependent upon all the facts in the particular case. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(b).) (d)  Accrual or vesting and payment of vacation benefits. Where a prevailing WD\nspecifies “one week paid vacation after one year of service with a contractor\nor successor,” an employee who renders the “one year of service” continuously\nbecomes eligible for the “one week paid vacation” (i.e., 40 hours of paid\nvacation, unless otherwise specified in an applicable WD) upon his/her\nanniversary date of employment and upon each succeeding anniversary date\nthereafter. There is no accrual or vesting of vacation eligibility before the\nemployee’s anniversary date of employment, and no segment of time smaller than\none year need be considered in computing the employer’s vacation liability,\nunless otherwise specifically provided for in a particular WD. The vacation\nbenefits need not be provided by the employer on the date of vesting. However,\nthe required benefit must be furnished before the employee’s next anniversary\ndate, before the current contract is completed, or before the employee\nterminates employment, whichever occurs first. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(c)(2).) (e)   Contractor liability for vacation benefits. The liability for an\nemployee’s vacation is not prorated among contractors unless specifically\nprovided for in a particular WD. The contractor by whom a person is employed at\nthe time the vacation right vests, i.e., on the employee’s anniversary date of\nemployment, must provide the full benefit required by the applicable WD on that\ndate before the employee’s next anniversary date, before the current contract\nis completed, or before the employee terminates employment, whichever occurs\nfirst. Thus, vacation benefits must be complied with in full on an annual\nbasis. Any unused vacation benefits may not be “carried over” from year to\nyear. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.173(c)-(d).) (f)   Certified listing of employee anniversary dates. In the case of a contract\nperformed at a Federal facility where employees may be retained by a succeeding\ncontractor, 29 C.F.R. 4.6(1)(2) provides that the incumbent prime contractor\nmust furnish a certified list of all service employees on the contractor’s or\nsubcontractor’s payroll during the last month of the contract, together with\nthe anniversary dates of employment (with the incumbent as well as predecessor contractors)\nof each such employee, to the contracting officer not less than 10 days before\ncontract completion. A copy of this list is to be provided to the successor\ncontractor for determining employee eligibility for vacation FBs which are\nbased on length of service with predecessor contractors (where such benefit is\nrequired by an applicable WD). Failure to obtain such employment data does not\nrelieve a contractor from any obligation to provide vacation benefits. (See 29\nC.F.R. 4.173(d)(2).) (g)   Rate applicable to computation of vacation benefits. The rate applicable to the\ncomputation of vacation benefits is the applicable WD rate or employee’s\nregular rate of pay, whichever is higher, at the time the vacation benefit is\nprovided or a cash equivalent is paid. If an applicable WD requires that the\nhourly wage rate be increased during the period of the contract, the rate\napplicable to the computation of any required vacation benefits is the hourly\nrate in effect in the w/w in which the actual paid vacation is provided or the\nequivalent is paid, as the case may be, and would not be the average of two\nhourly rates. This rule would not apply to situations where a WD specified a\ndifferent method of computation and the rate to be used. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.173(e)(1).) (h)  Cash equivalent for vacation. Where an employer elects to\npay an hourly cash equivalent in lieu of a paid vacation, which is computed in\naccordance with 29 C.F.R. 4.177(c)(5), such payments need commence only after\nthe employee has satisfied the “after one year of service” requirement (in\ncases where there is such an eligibility requirement). However, should the\nemployee terminate employment for any reason before receiving the full amount\nof vested vacation benefits due, the employee must be paid the full amount of\nany difference remaining as a final cash payment. The rate applicable to the\ncomputation of cash equivalents for vacation benefits is the hourly wage rate\nin effect at the time such equivalent payments are actually made. (See 29\nC.F.R. 4.173(c)(1) and (e)(1).)",
