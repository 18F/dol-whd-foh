For example, the SCA would\nnot be applicable to agreements with the Social Security Administration under\nwhich patient care services are furnished by hospitals participating in the\nMedicare program. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.107(b).) (b)  Contracts with nursing homes. The SCA does not apply to\nnursing homes solely by reason of their participation in the Medicare or\nMedicaid programs. (See (a) above.) Contracts between the Veterans\nAdministration and nursing homes, however, are covered. (c)   Contracts for ambulance services. Generally, the SCA is not\napplicable to ambulance services furnished pursuant to contracts for Medicare\nor Medicaid. Federal contracts for the furnishing of ambulance services (e.g.,\nVA hospitals), however, are covered by the SCA as the exemption provided by Section\n7(3) of the Act does not apply. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.118.)",
