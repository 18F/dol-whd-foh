  "text": "If an employee has\nbeen provided notice of the FMLA notice requirements and fails to comply with\nthose requirements, his or her FMLA coverage may be delayed. (a)   If an\nemployee knows of the need for leave and the approximate date the leave would\nbe taken 30 days in advance of the leave but fails to give notice of the need\nfor leave with no reasonable excuse, the employer may delay FMLA coverage until\n30 days after the date the employee provides notice. (b)   If the\nemployee knows of the need for leave fewer than 30 days in advance but fails to\ngive notice of the need for leave as soon as practicable under the\ncircumstances, the extent to which the employer may delay leave depends on the\nfacts of the particular case.  For example, if an employee reasonably should\nhave given the employer two weeks notice but instead only provided one week\nnotice, then the employer may delay FMLA-protected leave for one week. (c)   If the\nneed for leave is unforeseen, the extent to which the employer may delay leave\ndepends on the circumstances.  For example, if it was practicable for the\nemployee to provide notice very soon after the need for leave arises but the\nemployee does not provide notice until two days after the leave began, then the\nemployer may delay FMLA coverage of the leave by two days. 29 CFR 825.304",
