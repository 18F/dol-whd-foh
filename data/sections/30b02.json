  "text": "In non-OT w/w’s or in w/w’s in which the OT\nprovisions do not apply, an employee subject to section 6 of FLSA is considered\nto be paid in compliance if the overall earnings for the w/w equal or exceed\nthe amount due at the applicable MW. This is true regardless of whether the\nemployee is paid on the basis of a single hourly rate, different hourly rates,\ncommissions, certain bonuses, or some combination of these methods. In other\nwords, if the employee’s total earnings for the w/w (including certain bonuses\nsuch as a production bonus - see FOH 30b07) divided by compensable hours equals\nor exceeds the applicable MW, the employee has been paid in compliance with Sec\n6. These principles will also apply where an employee is not compensated for\ntime which is compensable under FLSA. For example, if an employee subject to\nthe $3.35 MW during a w/w is paid for 32 hours at $5.50 per hour and is paid at\na lesser rate or nothing at all for 8 or fewer additional hours worked, this\nindividual is considered to have been paid in compliance with Sec 6. The WH\nposition regarding proper payment in w/w’s where OT is due is set out in 32j02.",
