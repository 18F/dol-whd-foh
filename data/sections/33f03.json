  "text": "(a)  \nSection 13(c)(2) reads as follows:\n“The provisions of section 12 of this title relating to child labor shall apply\nto an employee below the age of sixteen employed in agriculture in an\noccupation that the Secretary of Labor finds and declares to be particularly\nhazardous for the employment of children below the age of 16, except where such\nemployee is employed by his parent or by a person standing in the place of his\nparent on a farm owned or operated by such parent or person.”  (b)  \nThe 16-year minimum age for\nagricultural employment in occupations declared to be hazardous applies to\ncovered agricultural employment which meets the definition given in Sec 3(f)\nand without regard to whether or not such employment is subject to the MW\nprovided by Sec 6(a)(5). The 16-year minimum age does not depend upon whether\nor not the employment is “outside school hours.” Thus, the 16-year minimum age\nfor such hazardous occupations applies during vacation periods as well as hours\nbefore and after school or on nonschool days.  (c)  \nThe parental exemption from the Ag\nH.O.s in Sec 13(c)(2) from the HO/A applies to the minor’s natural parent or to\na “person standing in the place of his parent”, as long as the employment is on\na farm owned or operated by such parent or person.  (d)  \nOwned by the parent or person\nstanding in the place of the parent includes part ownership as a partner in a\npartnership or as an officer of a corporation which owns the farm if the\nownership interest in the partnership or corporation is substantial.  (e)  \nOperated by the parent or person standing in the place of the\nparent means that the person exerts active and direct control over the\noperation of the farm or ranch by making day-to-day decisions affecting basic\nincome, assigning work, hiring and firing employees and exercising direct\nsupervision of the farm or ranch work. Ranch managers, therefore, who meet\nthese criteria could employ his or her own children under 16 on the ranch they\noperate without regard to the provisions of the HO/A.  (f)  \nThe 18-year minimum age set by the\n17 nonagricultural HOs (see FOH 33h), does not apply to an\nemployee employed in “agriculture” as defined in § 3(f). For example, if a\nminor under 18 is employed in agriculture and works as a driver on a motor\nvehicle, HO 2 does not apply even though the minor may go “in or about” a\nproducing establishment to deliver the farmer’s products.  On the other hand,\nif the minor’s employment does not meet the tests in Sec 3(f), HO 2 would apply\nin the normal manner.  If a minor under 16 is employed in agriculture as\ndefined in Sec 3(f), he or she is subject only to the hazardous occupation\norders in agriculture set forth in (g) below.  (g)  \nThe following\noccupations in agriculture have been declared hazardous by the Secretary of\nLabor for the employment of minors under 16 years of age:  (1) \nOperating a tractor of\nover 20 PTO (power takeoff) horsepower, or connecting or disconnecting an\nimplement or any of its parts to or from such a tractor:  a.    \nFarm tractors overturn\neasily and the operator or passenger may be seriously injured. Serious injuries\nare complicated if the accident occurs in an isolated area and is not\ndiscovered quickly.  b.    \nThe rotating drive\nmechanisms of implements or power takeoff drives inflict serious injuries if\nparts of the body or clothing come in contact with the exposed driveshaft or\nmoving parts.  c.    \nPersons under 16 may\noperate garden-type tractors.  (2) \nOperating or assisting\nto operate (including starting, stopping, adjusting, feeding, or any other\nactivity involving physical contact associated with the operation) any of the\nfollowing machines:  a.    \nCorn picker, cotton\npicker, grain combine, hay mower, forage harvester, hay baler, potato digger,\nor mobile pea viner.  1.    \nThese machines use\nrotary gears, revolving shafts, driving chains, belts, augers, conveyor belts\nand chains, knives, blowers, levers, and hydraulic pistons to grasp, cut,\npound, grind, convey, compress, push, or pull material.  2.    \nThe farm worker\nsometimes comes in contact with the moving parts and is seriously injured when\nhe or she tries to unclog, repair, or adjust the machine when the motor is\nrunning.  b.    \nFeed grinder, crop\ndryer, forage blower, auger conveyor, or the unloading mechanism of a\nnongravity-type self loading wagon or trailer.  1.    \nThese machines, except\nfor some that are fed manually, are similar in construction and operation to\nthose described above, and involve the same hazards. There is an additional\ndanger that if a part of the body is caught by a turning auger, amputation is\nalmost unavoidable.  2.  \nPersons under 16 may\nmove the crop to the person feeding the machine and remove the finished product\nfrom the area; they may load and unload material from other types of conveyors,\nsuch as belt, bucket, or chain.  3.  \nThe unloading of a\nbulk body truck, including machines with self-unloading bulk boxes, meets the\ndescription of this Ag H.O. and is prohibited for minors under age 16. However,\nthe operation of a potato bin piler is permitted for minors under 16 years of age\nworking on farms.  c.    \nPower post-hole\ndigger, power post-driver, or nonwalking type rotary tiller.  1.    \nThe hazard of the\npost-hole digger is the danger of becoming entangled with the rotating drive.\nThe hazard with the power post-hole driver, is a possibility of being struck by\nthe descending ram.  2.    \nPersons under 16 may\nset posts in holes, tamp the earth, attach and stretch wire, install gates, and\nrepair fences.  (3) \nOperating or assisting\nto operate (including starting, stopping, adjusting, feeding, or any other\nactivity involving physical contact associated with the operation) any of the\nfollowing machines:  a.    \nTrencher or\nearthmoving equipment. The hazards of earthmoving or trenching equipment are\nentanglement with moving parts and falling under a moving piece of equipment.  b.    \nForklift. Forklifts\nhave a double hazard of falling loads and overturning. They also accidentally\nmay be driven over the edge of platforms.  c.  \nPotato combine  d.  \nPower-driven circular,\nband, or chain saw. The chief hazards in connection with saws are the danger of\namputation and severe cuts from contact with the cutting edge.  (4) \nWorking on a farm in a\nyard, pen, or stall occupied by a bull, boar, or stud horse maintained for\nbreeding purposes or a sow with suckling pigs, or cow with newborn calf (with\numbilical cord present):  a.    \nHandling these animals\nrequires experience, skill, and strength. If they attack without warning,\nescape is especially difficult from confined areas.  b.    \nThis section does not\nprohibit work with these or any animals in an open area. It does not prohibit\nwork with beef or range bulls and cattle, dairy cattle, or breeding stock on\nthe range.  (5) \nFelling, bucking,\nskidding, loading, or unloading timber with butt diameter of more than 6\ninches:  Workers\nunder 16 are still permitted to work with timber up to 6 inches in diameter,\nwhich includes most fence posts and tier poles. (6)  Working from a ladder or scaffold (painting,\nrepairing, or building structures, pruning trees, picking fruit, etc., at a\nheight of over twenty feet: a.    \nMany severe injuries occur when\nwork is done from a ladder or scaffold at a considerable height. b.    \nThis section does not prohibit\nusing ladders to reach a work site above twenty feet, as long as the work is\nnot done from a ladder or scaffold. (7)  Driving a bus, truck, or automobile when transporting\npassengers, or riding on a tractor as a passenger or helper: a.    \nExposure to traffic while moving\nat considerable speed makes driving a motor vehicle on a public road or highway\nhazardous.  The additional responsibility of carrying passengers makes such\ndriving unsuitable for minors under 16 years of age. b.    \nIn addition, most states will not\nissue a driver’s license for a youth under 16 years of age. c.    \nMinors under 16 may drive a truck\nor automobile on the farm itself.  However, they may not ride on any tractor or\nserve as a helper on any tractor. (8)  Working inside: a.    \nA fruit, forage, or grain storage\ndesigned to retain an oxygen deficient or toxic atmosphere, b.    \nAn upright silo within two weeks\nafter silage has been added or when a top unloading device is in operating\nposition, c.    \nA manure pit, or d.    \nA horizontal silo while operating\na tractor for packing purposes. 1.    \nWhen oxygen is replaced by another\ngas or consumed by fermentation, anyone entering these storage areas is in\ndanger of asphyxiation. 2.    \nIf the top unloading device is in\noperating position in the silo, a person may become entangled in its cutting\nand tearing mechanism and be seriously injured. 3.    \nEmployees under 16 may work inside\nthe non-gas-tight type silo while the unloading device is in a raised position,\nand they may also operate this device from outside the silo. 4.    \nThe hazard involved in operating a\ntractor for packing purposes in a horizontal silo is the danger of overturning. (9)  Handling or applying (including cleaning or\ndecontaminating equipment, disposal or return of empty containers, or serving a\ns flagman for aircraft applying) agricultural chemicals classified under the\nFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 135 et seq.)\nas Category I of toxicity, identified by the word “poison” and the “skull\nand crossbones” on the label or Category II of toxicity, identified by the word\n“warning” on the label: a.    \nMany agricultural chemicals\npresent serious health hazards.  Some have a corrosive effect on body tissue. \nSome affect the central nervous system, causing respiratory failures and many\ncause death by the accumulation of even minute quantities over a prolonged\nperiod. b.    \nThe hazards involved in the job of\nflagman are that the employee must stand in the line of the flight to direct\nthe pilot and also because of the possibility of contamination from the\nchemicals being applied. c.    \nMinors under 16 may handle and\napply fertilizers or chemicals that are not labeled as indicated by this AG H.O. (10)  Handling or using a blasting agent, including but not\nlimited to, dynamite, black powder, sensitized ammonium nitrate, blasting caps,\nand primer cord:   The\nuse of blasting agents requires experience and expertise.  Mishandling can\nresult in accidental detonation, maiming, or loss of life. (11)  Transporting, transferring, or applying anhydrous\nammonia: Vapors\nare very irritating to the eyes and to the respiratory system.  In case of\ncontact with the skin, it may result in severe burns.  Too high a concentration\nof vapors could cause suffocation. (a)  \nThe following are some examples of\nwork activities not affected by the Ag H.O.s.: (1)  Handling chemical pesticides and fertilizers not\nincluded in Item (9) above, (2)  Driving a truck, automobile, or bus on the farm proper\nand serving as helpers on such vehicles, (3)  Loading and unloading trucks, (4)  Operating garden-type tractors, (5)  Picking vegetables and berries, and placing them on\nconveyors or in containers, (6)  Clearing brush and harvesting trees up to 6 inches in\nbutt diameter, (7)  Working from ladders at heights less than 20 feet,\nsuch as picking of most fruits (8)  Working with farm animals, except work with certain breeding\nstock in confined areas, including showing any animal at livestock shows,\nfairs, exhibits, or similar activities when not taking place on a farm, (9)  Hand planting and cultivation, (10)  Raising and caring for poultry, (11)  Milking cows, (12)  Processing and storing milk and dairy products, (13)  Cleaning barns, equipment storage buildings, chicken\ncoops, etc., (14)  Mowing lawns, (15)  Riding, driving, or exercising horses, (16)  Picking cotton, (17)  Handling of irrigation pipes, (18)  Harvesting and storing tobacco, (19)  Riding on transplanters.",
