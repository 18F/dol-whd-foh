  "text": "(a)  \nPine straw is the\nfresh, undecomposed pine needles that have fallen from pine trees.  It is\nproduced commercially and collected for use as a mulch and groundcover.  The\nraking, gathering, baling and loading of pine straw for commercial purposes is\nusually performed in pine stands or plantations, from pine trees being grown\nfor forestry and lumbering operations. (b)  Based on the plain language of the\nstatute, forestry and lumbering operations are not considered primary\nagriculture. (c)  \nPine straw\nactivities generally will not qualify as secondary agriculture, unless all the\nactivities are performed by a farmer or on a farm in conjunction with the other\nfarming operations. (d)  Since pine straw activities typically\ndo not qualify as primary or secondary agriculture, the minimum wage and\novertime pay protections of the FLSA will apply to most pine straw workers. (e)  \nSection 13(b)(28)\nexempts from overtime pay “any employee employed in planting or tending trees,\ncruising, surveying, or felling timber, or in preparing or transporting logs or\nother forestry products to the mill, processing plant, railroad, or other\ntransportation terminal, if the number of employees employed by his employer in\nsuch forestry or lumbering operations does not exceed eight.”  Pine straw workers\nare typically employed in the forestry or lumbering operations described in\nthis exemption because pine straw is a natural substance of trees and therefore\na “forestry product.”  See 29 USC 213(b)(28).  Pine straw workers will\ntherefore qualify for the Section 13(b)(28) exemption when the employer employs\neight or fewer pine straw workers. (f)  \nThe FLSA\nagricultural child labor standards, allowing pine straw workers under the age\nof 16 to perform all pine straw activities except operating and assisting in\noperation of a forklift, would generally only apply to pine straw activities if\nthey qualified as secondary agriculture.  The FLSA child labor provisions for\nnonagricultural work prohibit pine straw workers under the age of 16 from\nemployment in pine straw activities and prohibit those who are 16 and 17 years\nold from operating or assisting in the operation of power-driven hoisting\ndevices, such as forklifts, backhoes, and skid steer loaders. (g)  \nSince pine straw\nactivities generally do not qualify as agriculture under the FLSA, employers\nmay continue to utilize the H-2B temporary worker program as opposed to the\nH-2A temporary worker program. (h)  See FOH 57k for the application of\nMSPA to pine straw workers and FOH 36b07 for the application of the OSH Act\nField Sanitation Standards to pine straw workers.",
