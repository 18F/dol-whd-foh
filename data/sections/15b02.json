  "text": "(a)   The Portal-to-Portal Act (PA) applies to the D-B Act.\nIt prevents the commencement of any court suit for unpaid straight-time wages\nmore than 2 years after performance of the work (3 years in the case of willful\nviolations), where such actions are judicially determined to be permissible\nunder the law. However, it is the Department’s position that the PA does not\napply to administrative actions initiated through the ALJ hearing procedures,\nand thus, the PA does not preclude such corrective administrative action after\ntwo (or three) years. (b)  Failure to pay the minimum rates specified in a D-B contract\nis a breach of the contract, and the contracting agency may withhold funds\nsufficient to pay the unpaid employees. Such funds may be withheld from the\ncontractor without regard to the statute of limitations in the PA and may be\ntransferred to the Comptroller General and paid to the underpaid employee\nwithout regard to such time limit. (c)   The PA does not apply to Federally-assisted projects\n(the Related Acts) on which D-B wage rates are required to be paid. The various\nState statutes of limitations would apply to such projects in private actions\nwhere they are judicially determined to be permissible under the law. The\nfederal six-year statute of limitations would apply in government enforcement\nactions (28 U.S.C. § 2415(a)).",
