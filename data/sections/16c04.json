  "text": "(a)   Although the protection provided by sec 304 is limited\nto discharge, a suspension for an indefinite period or for so long that the\nemployee’s return to duty is unlikely may be considered tantamount to a\ndischarge. A careful examination of all the facts in a particular case is\nneeded to determine if the limitation on discharge provision applies to a\nparticular suspension action. A suspension would not be considered a discharge,\nif the employee can obtain the funds necessary to satisfy the garnishment or\ncan otherwise secure a release from the garnishment. However, a suspension\naction may be a “discharge” within the meaning of sec 304(a), if the employee\nis unable to secure a release or obtain funds to satisfy the garnishment and is\nno longer in pay status to enable the earning of wages to apply against the debt\n(See FOH 52v13(b)(2).) (b)  The term “discharge” is interpreted to include any\nadverse action that interrupts employment to the degree that a prudent employee\nwould look for another job. A long suspension is considered tantamount to a\ntermination of employment, and thus a “discharge” within the meaning of sec 304(a).\nFor example, if an employer disciplines an employee by a series of gradually\nincreased suspensions of several days duration following subsequent\ngarnishments on the same indebtedness, it could result in a violation of sec\n304(a). Even where a suspension is five or ten days long, the circumstances may\nindicate that a discharge in violation of sec 304(a) exists. (c)   A demotion and/or transfer based wholly or in part on\na single garnishment is constructively a discharge in violation of sec 304(a).\nA reasonable interpretation of the effect of transferring a person to a\nposition paying less money is that of a discharge.",
