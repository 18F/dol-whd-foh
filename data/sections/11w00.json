  "text": "(a)   Employees of a warehouse, the storage facilities of\nwhich are used in the course of interstate transportation and distribution of\ngoods, are engaged in interstate commerce. (b)   The unloading, inspecting, and checking of goods\nreceived at warehouse from outside the State, and the keeping of records with\nrespect thereto, constitute engagement in interstate commerce. (c)   Whether employees engaged in and about a warehouse in\nhandling goods after their receipt from outside the State are engaged in\ninterstate commerce, depends upon the disposition and destination of the goods\nafter they leave the warehouse. In those situations where the flow of\ninterstate commerce terminates upon receipt of the goods at the warehouse, only\nthose employees are individually covered whose activities pertain to the\nreceipt of the goods. In situations where the flow of interstate commerce\ncontinues through or begins after the warehousing operations, all employees are\nindividually covered who participate in any of the work through which goods are\nreceived, stored, or distributed, or in any activities so closely related\nthereto as to be a part thereof. (d)   Where goods are received from outside the State and\nstored in bulk warehouses, the stream of interstate commerce does not\nnecessarily end there, but may continue until the goods are delivered from the\nwarehouse to a dealer or consumer. In the case of subsequent distribution\nwithin the same State, if the goods belong to a wholesaler who will distribute\nthem to retailers or other wholesalers, the warehouse employees who handle the\ngoods during their stay in the warehouse and who deliver them to the retailers\nor wholesalers, may be engaged in interstate commerce under the principles of\nthe Jacksonville Paper case. (See FOH 11w08.) (e)   Goods that are destined for another State may be\nconsidered to be moving in interstate commerce even prior to their crossing of\na State line. Hence, the temporary storage of such goods may be considered\nengagement in interstate commerce, depending upon the circumstances of such\nstorage with relation to previous and subsequent movement of the goods. All\nemployees in the ordinary warehouse serving chain stores which receives goods\nfrom outside the State are individually covered even though the distribution\nmay be entirely intrastate. A similar result will follow where the distribution\nof the warehouse or wholesale house is confined to a limited group of\nretailers, such as wholesalers who distribute only to members of a particular\nassociation of retail stores.",
