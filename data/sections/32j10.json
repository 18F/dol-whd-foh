However, if the\ncorrect OT compensation cannot be determined until sometime after the regular\npay period, the requirements of the FLSA or the PCA will be satisfied if the\nemployee is paid the excess OT compensation as soon after the regular payday as\nis practicable, but not later than the next payday after the computation can be\nmade. Where bonuses are paid, any extra OT pay due upon the increase in the\nregular rate resulting from the bonus payment is due only at the time the bonus\nitself is paid, not earlier.",
