  "text": "(a)   Meals -\nFood service establishments (1)  The “reasonable\ncost” of meals furnished by a food service establishment to its employees\nincludes only the actual cost to the employer of the food, its preparation, and\nrelated supplies. Salary or wage costs, as distinguished from material or\nsupply costs, may be claimed only to the extent that such salary or wage costs\nare shown to be directly attributable to the cost of providing meals to\nemployees. If food preparation/serving employees of a food service\nestablishment would be paid the same rate of pay even if meals were not\nprovided to the employees of the establishment, their wage costs cannot be\nincluded in determining reasonable cost. Conversely, if it were necessary to\nhire extra personnel or pay higher wages to existing employees in order for\nthem to assist in furnishing meals to employees, such extra expense would be a\nlegitimate cost which could be included in determining the “reasonable cost” of\nmeals. (2)  Costs which a\nfood service employer incurs regardless of whether the employees were furnished\nmeals may not be included in determining the “reasonable cost.” In a food\nservice establishment, items such as employee insurance, payroll taxes, menus,\ndecorations, other operating supplies, laundry, telephone, maintenance\nservices, advertising and promotion, building and equipment rental, licenses\nand taxes, insurance and depreciation, franchise cost, and general\nadministrative costs are a part of the overall cost of the operation of the\nemployer’s business establishment which may not be charged to the reasonable\ncost of employees’ meals. (b)   Meals -\nNon food service establishments Determination of the “reasonable cost” of meals\nfurnished to employees of an establishment which is not a food service\nestablishment involve different criteria for expenses for which an employer may\ntake credit. For example, where meals are provided to employees of a non\nfood-service establishment by a catering service and there are no special\nfacilities wherein meals are consumed, the actual cost of the catering service,\nassuming no rebate to the employer, would be the “reasonable cost.” In more\ncomplex situations where dining areas are provided, the factors discussed in\n(a) above must be considered in making a determination of the “reasonable cost”\nof meals furnished to employees of a non food-service establishment. (c)   Lodging Employers taking credit for housing as part of\nwages must show that the amounts charged are not more than the actual cost to\nthe employer. (See Reg 531.3(a).) However, if the actual cost of providing\nlodging is more than its established rental value, the rental value shall be\ndeemed to be the reasonable cost of lodging. (See FOH 30c07.) The actual cost\nto the employer generally involves the following factors: (1)  Adequate\nDepreciation. Reg 531.3(c) allows\nan employer to include “adequate depreciation” as an element of cost.\nDepreciation is a concept primarily used in and extensively regulated under the\ntax laws. Depreciation is applicable to certain capital goods (e.g. buildings,\nvehicles, machines, etc.). It is never applicable to land. For purposes of Reg\n531 “adequate depreciation” is not more than the amount of depreciation\nactually claimed and allowed under the tax laws for the property in question\nfor the period in question. It should be noted that the amount of depreciation\nallowable on any property may vary from year to year. If the employer declines\nto provide tax returns or similar evidence as to the claim and allowance of\ndepreciation under the tax laws, no allowance will be made under Reg 531.3(c).                                              \na.     For\ntax purposes, depreciation might be claimed under several line items for\nproperty involved in the furnishing of a facility. For example, an employer\nfurnishing lodging might properly claim the depreciation of the building at one\nplace; the depreciation of the beds at another; and the depreciation of linens\nat another. The addition of several such items of depreciation could be\nappropriate. Similarly, an employer might claim, in a single line item,\ndepreciation on a greater piece of property than is involved in furnishing the\nfacility in question. For example, the owner of a 20 unit motel who furnishes\none unit for the lodging of an employee might claim depreciation on the entire\nmotel building as a single line item. Under these circumstances, pro rata\nallocation of the claimed depreciation would be required. In the example,\nassuming no complications (e.g. no part of building used for other proposes;\nall units equal size, etc.), the allowable depreciation would be 1/20 = 5\npercent of the total depreciation taken.                                              \nb.     For\ntax purposes, depreciation is claimed by the year and can be prorated as\nappropriate. (2)  Capital\nInvested. The computation of “a\nreasonable allowance (not more than 5 1/2 percent) for interest on the\ndepreciated amount of capital invested by the employer” (as referred to in Reg\n531.3(c)) is made as follows: Step 1: An amount, V,\nrepresents the total depreciable value of the property to the employer. (See\n(1) above. This number is not derived from or necessarily related to “fair\nmarket value”.) Ordinarily, this will be the purchase price plus the cost of\ncapital improvements. It should be noted that no part of the cost of land is\nincluded. Step 2: Compute the\namount, A, by which the depreciable value, V, exceeds the depreciation already\ntaken (or which might have been taken) as a tax deduction (i.e., subtract total\nallowable depreciation to date from V, the result is A.) This number is\nrequired to be reported on the employer’s tax returns. If the employer declines\nto make tax returns available for verification, then A shall be deemed to be\nzero. If A = 0, no further computation is required; the allowance for this part\nis zero. Step 3: Determine the\namount, E, of the employer’s equity in V. This would ordinarily be the sum of the\ndown payment, portions of mortgage payments applied toward principal, and the\ncash contribution toward any capital improvements included in V. Step 4: Compute (E/V)\ntimes (A). Conceptually, this is the portion of the equity which has not been\n“returned” to the employer through depreciation. A “reasonable allowance”,\ni.e., a “return on investment” of up to 5 1/2 percent of this number, may be\nincluded in the employer’s cost. (d)   Cost of\noperation (1)  Annual costs of\noperation incurred in furnishing lodging facilities must be considered in\nmaking “reasonable cost” determinations: these include interest on loans to\npurchase, maintain, or improve the lodging facility, taxes, repairs and\nmaintenance, insurance, and utilities (electricity, water, sewers, garbage collection,\nfuel oil, and so forth.) Repair and maintenance expenses refer to the costs\nwhich are not included under capital improvements. Only the portion of those\ncosts which are directly related to the lodging facility used by the\nemployee(s) may be taken into account in determining the actual cost of\nproviding the lodging. As an example, the cost of property insurance should be\nprorated in proportion to the space of the lodging actually used by the\nemployee(s). (2)  When the\nemployer leases a property from another person, the amount of rent paid by the\nemployer to the other person is considered part of the “reasonable cost”\nprovided that the rent charged provides no profit for the employer, directly or\nindirectly. As an example, if an employer pays a higher rental charge with the\npromise of a rebate from the property owner as an encouragement to lease\ncertain lodging facilities, such higher rent payment may not be used as a\ncomponent of the “reasonable cost” for leasing the lodging facilities. The\nallowable “reasonable cost” amount would be the rent paid by the employer minus\nthe amount of rebate promised and received by the employer from the property\nowner. (3)  When\ndetermining the weekly “reasonable cost” of a lodging facility which may be\nclaimed as a wage credit, the sum of the annual costs (as determined in (1) and\n(2) above) is divided by the number of weeks during which the lodging facility\nis used for occupancy. Where the facility is used for other purposes, in\naddition to lodging, the annual cost is first prorated among the uses. Once the\nweekly “reasonable cost” amount has been determined, it should be divided by\nthe actual number of occupants in the lodging facility where each is provided\nan equal amount of living area. However, if the living areas within the lodging\nfacility are not equal in size, the weekly “reasonable cost” amount should be\ndivided by the square feet of the dwelling. The wage credit which may be\nclaimed per employee in such cases shall be based upon the number of square\nfeet occupied by the employee and /or that individual’s family.",
