  "text": "(a)   Employees may receive an additional premium payment\nfor employees performing hazardous, arduous, or dirty work. Such premium\npayments are not creditable as premium OT work and must be included as part of\nthe basic or regular rate in computing OT under the CWHSSA in the same manner\nas under the FLSA. On the other band, where the parties have agreed on premium\nrates for work qualifying as OT under FLSA Sections 7(e)(5), (6), or (7) which\nare computed as a multiple of the base rate specified by the agreement, the\nextra compensation paid for such OT which is in excess of the statutory\n“regular rate” may be credited, under Section 7(h) of the FLSA, toward the 50\npercent premium compensation for OT which is required by the Act’s provision\nfor an OT rate of “not less than one and one-half times” the statutory “regular\nrate”. A like rule applies under the CWHSSA. (b)  For example, an agreement provides for a rate of pay\nof $13 an hour for a crane operator with double-time for work in excess of 8\nhours/day or 40 hours a week. A crane operator works 9 hours a day 5 days a\nweek. Under the agreement, the crane operator is entitled to $585 (45 x $13) in\nstraight time compensation and $65 (5 x $13 for agreed double-time OT rate) in\nOT compensation for a total of $650. The OT premium due under the FLSA is\n$32.50 (5 hours x .5 x $13) and the employer paid $65. Since the employee\nreceived a creditable premium, the employee is paid in compliance. (c)   For another example assume the same employee works\nunder an agreement that provides a rate of $12 an hour for a crane operator,\nwith double time based on such rate for work in excess of 8 hours a day or 40\nhours a week and an additional $1 an hour for a crane with a boom length of\nover 275 feet. Under the agreement, an operator of a crane with such a boom\nlength who works 9 hours a day, 5 days a week is entitled to $645 for the week\n($480 for 40 hours at $12, plus $45 for 45 hours long-boom rate of $1, plus\n$120 for 5 OT hours at $24,). If paid in accordance with such an agreement the\nemployee is paid in compliance with the FLSA and the CWHSSA. Under both Acts,\nthe “regular rate” or “basic rate” is $13 an hour, which includes the $1 per\nhour for the long-boom time. An additional payment of not less than $6.50 an\nhour as extra compensation for weekly OT is required for 5 of the 45 hours\nworked (5 x 6.50 = $32.50 required OT premium). Thus, the statutory\nrequirements are met by payment of $60 (5 hours x $12 agreed double-time OT\npremium rate).The agreed double-time OT payment which is creditable (5 x $12 =\n$60) is more than enough to satisfy the statutory OT pay requirement (5 x $6.50\n= $32.50).",
