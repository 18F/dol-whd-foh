  "text": "(a)   In most cases the transportation of goods\nfrom a point of origin within a State to a processing or manufacturing\nestablishment in the same State is not exempt under Sec 13(b)(1) because an\nactual out-of-State movement of the goods does not begin until the processing\nor manufacturing has taken place. (See IB 782.7(c).) In the usual situation\nthere are two separate and distinct movements of the goods under the Motor Carrier\nAct, the one before processing being in “intrastate” commerce and the one after\nproces­sing being in “interstate or foreign” commerce. There are certain\nsituations, however, where processing or packaging operations are performed on\ngoods during the course of their movement to a specified out-of-State\ndestination under such circumstances that the exemption may be applied to the\ntransportation preceding the operations as well as to that which follows. Such\ntransportation is viewed as a single movement for purposes of the Motor Carrier\nAct and FLSA Sec 13(b)(1) where the practical continuity of the journey from\nthe point of origin within the State to the intended out-of-State destination\nhas not been broken. The following examples illustrate this principle: (1) \nCoal being shipped to\nan out-of-State buyer is hauled to a tipple where, in a continuous operation,\nit is unloaded from the truck and cleaned, crushed, or graded and loaded\ndirectly into railroad cars for shipment out-of-State; or (2) \nHousehold goods are transported\nby truck from a home to a warehouse to be crated or packed so that the movement\nby motor vehicle to the intended out-of-State destination may be continued.",
