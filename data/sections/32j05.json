  "text": "(a)  \nPermanent reduction. (1)  A permanent reduction in a fixed schedule of workweek\nhours without a reduction in the salary or take-home pay results in an\nincreased regular rate. Where the employer has continued to use the original\nrate in computing OT, a violation shall be charged. However, where such a\nviolation resulted from a genuine misunderstanding of the OT requirements, no\nrequest for payment of back wages shall be made. The employees involved and the\namount of beck wages shall not be reported on Form WH-51. A brief explanation shall\nbe made in the narrative. The employer shall be advised of the rights of\nemployees under Sec 16(b). (2)  The following conditions will be indicative of a\ngenuine misunderstanding: a.    \nIt is clear that there was\ncompliance before the change, that is, the rates then used for straight time\nand OT purposes were bona fide and properly paid; and b.    \nthe reduction in hours without a\nreduction in take-home pay was intended to and did benefit the employees; and c.    \nthere was no intention to evade\nthe payment of the OT premium required by the Act. (3)  The employer shall be advised that the payment of the\nsame take-home pay for the reduced workweek establishes an increased regular\nrate of pay which must be used to compute OT compensation for all statutory OT\nhours. (b)  \nTemporary or\nseasonal-reduction. (1)  As a general rule, a reduction in a fixed schedule of\nworkweek hours without reduction in salary or take-home pay for all weeks of a\nspecified period of definite and reasonably long duration, such as a seasonal\nslack period, will result in an increased regular rate, as in the case of a\npermanent reduction. The policy set forth in (a) above will be followed as to\nthe requirements for future compliance and in making the determination as to\nwhether to request payment of back wages in such cases. (2)  Where employees are given time off on a temporary\nbasis such as all Saturdays or some part of them in the summer months, or other\nbona fide seasonal vacation periods, without reduction of salary or take-home\npay, the time off will be regarded as vacation time within the meaning of Sec\n7(e)(2). Thus, the pay for such time off will not affect the regular rate of\npay. Likewise, there would be no violation of the Act if the employer required\nthe employees to work those hours which were scheduled as vacation time off,\nwithout paying them additional compensation. The same result would follow if a\nhalf day off was given every other Saturday during the period of Daylight\nSaving Time. (c)  \nPermanent schedule of\nalternating workweek, of different fixed lengths.  Where\nan employer has established a permanent schedule of alternating workweeks of\ndifferent fixed lengths he/she may, by agreement or understanding with the\nemployee, pay the same straight-time compensation for the scheduled hours of\nthe “long” and “short” workweeks, but he/she may not pay the same fixed salary\nfor the long and short schedules of hours to cover total compensation including\nthe  OT\npay. The payment of the same straight-time compensation for the scheduled long\nand short workweeks establishes different rates of pay for the long and short\nscheduled workweek. If in such a case the employer has p id the same total\ncompensation for both the long and short scheduled workweeks the policy\nexpressed in (a) above will be followed.",
