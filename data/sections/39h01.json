  "text": "When leave is taken\nbecause of an employee’s own serious health condition or the serious health\ncondition of a family member, an employer may require the employee to obtain a\nmedical certification at the employee’s expense.  See FOH 39h06 for\ncertification of qualifying exigency leave and 39h07 for certification of\nmilitary caregiver leave. (a)   Sufficient\nmedical certification (1)  The FMLA\nprovides that a medical certification is sufficient if it states: a.     The\ndate the serious health condition commenced and probable duration of the\ncondition; b.     The\ncontact information of the health care provider and type of\npractice/specialization; c.     The\nappropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider\nregarding the condition sufficient to support the need for leave; d.     For\nleave to care for a family member, a statement that the employee is needed to\ncare for the family member and an estimate of the amount of time needed; or for\nleave for the employee’s own serious health condition, a statement that the\nemployee is unable to perform the essential functions of the position and the\nlikely duration of such inability; and e.     For\nintermittent or reduced schedule leave, the certification must also include: 1.     For\nplanned medical treatment of the employee’s or the employee’s family member’s\nserious health condition, a statement of the medical necessity for intermittent\nor reduced leave schedule and the dates treatment is expected and duration of\nsuch treatment, 2.     For\nunforeseeable leave for the employee’s own serious health condition (including\npregnancy) that causes unforeseen periods of incapacity, a statement of the\nmedical necessity for intermittent or reduced leave schedule and an estimation\nof the frequency and duration of such periods of incapacity, and, 3.     For\nunforeseeable leave for a family member’s serious health condition, a statement\nthat the leave schedule is medically necessary for the care of the family\nmember, which can include assisting in the family member’s recovery, and an\nestimate of the frequency and duration of the intermittent or reduced schedule\nleave. 29 USC 2613(b)29 CFR 825.306(a) (2)  Medical facts The medical facts appropriate for inclusion on\nthe certification form will vary depending on the nature of the serious health\ncondition and are to be determined by the health care provider but must be\nsufficient to support the need for leave.  For example, at the health care\nprovider’s discretion, the medical facts may include information on symptoms,\ndoctor’s visits, or a diagnosis.  Whether a diagnosis is included in the\ncertification form is left to the discretion of the health care provider and an\nemployer may not reject a complete and sufficient certification because it\nlacks a diagnosis. 73 FR 67934, 68014 (3)  Frequency and\nduration of the condition Not all absences caused by certain serious\nhealth conditions are predictable.  Health care providers are expected to\nprovide only their best informed medical judgment when estimating the need for\nunforeseeable intermittent leave. The FMLA does not permit an employer to\nrequire an exact schedule of leave for such instances. 73 FR 67934, 68017 (b)   Medical\ncertification forms (1)  An employer\nmay, but is not required to, use the DOL’s two optional forms—Form WH-380-E and\nForm WH-380-F—for use in obtaining medical certification. (2)  Employers may\ndevelop their own forms but may not request any additional information beyond\nthat specified by the regulations.  An employer may not reject a medical\ncertification that otherwise contains the information required by the\nregulations due to the form of the certification provided.  In all instances,\nthe certification must relate only to the condition for which leave is needed. 29 CFR 825.306(b) (c)   Annual\nmedical certification Where leave for a\nserious health condition lasts beyond a single leave year, a new medical\ncertification may be required in each subsequent FMLA leave year.  The employer\nmay request a medical certification with the first absence in a new 12-month\nleave year.  The employer may seek authentication and clarification and second\nand third opinions for these new medical certifications. 29 C.F.R. 825.305(e) (d)   Authentication\nand clarification of a medical certification (1)  The employer\nmay contact the health care provider for purposes of clarification and\nauthentication of the medical certification after the employer has given the\nemployee an opportunity to cure any deficiencies.  Employers may not ask for\nadditional information beyond that required by the certification form.  To make\nsuch contact, the employer must use a health care provider, a human resources\nprofessional, a leave administrator, or a management official.  Under no\ncircumstances may the employee’s direct supervisor contact the employee’s\nhealth care provider. (2)  Authentication\nmeans providing the health care provider with a copy of the certification and\nrequesting verification that the information contained on the certification\nform was completed and/or authorized by the health care provider who signed the\ndocument.  No additional information may be requested.  Clarification means\ncontacting the health care provider to understand the handwriting on the\nmedical certification or to understand the meaning of a response.  No\nadditional information may be requested. (3)  The\nrequirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\nPrivacy Rule govern the privacy of individually-identifiable health information\ncreated or held by HIPAA-covered entities.  Therefore, HIPAA requirements must\nbe satisfied when an employee’s or an employee’s family member’s\nindividually-identifiable health information is shared with an employer by a\nHIPAA-covered entity.  HIPAA requires, among other things, a written\nauthorization by the employee (or the employee’s family member) in order to\nrelease information for authentication and clarification purposes.  If an\nemployee does not provide such authorization to the health care provider\nallowing the employer to obtain clarification of an unclear certification, and\ndoes not otherwise clarify the certification, the employer may deny the FMLA\nleave. 73 FR 67934, 68018—68019 29 CFR 825.307(a) (e)   Second\nand third medical opinions (1)  An employer who\nhas reason to doubt the validity of a medical certification may request a second\nopinion at the employer’s expense.  The employer is permitted to designate the\nhealth care provider for the second opinion as long as the provider is not\nemployed on a regular basis by the employer, is not under contract with the\nemployer, or is not regularly utilized by the employer.  An exception can be\nmade if the employee is located in an area where access to health care is\nextremely limited, such as a rural area where there may be only one or two\ndoctors in a relevant specialty.  The designated health care provider must be\nwithin normal commuting distance, except in very unusual circumstances, and the\nemployer must reimburse the employee for reasonable travel expenses. (2)  Pending receipt\nof the additional medical opinion, the employee is provisionally entitled to\nFMLA benefits, including maintenance of group health benefits.  If the\ncertifications do not ultimately establish the employee’s entitlement to FMLA\nleave, the leave cannot be designated as FMLA leave and may be treated as paid\nor unpaid leave under the employer’s established leave policy. (3)  If the first\nand second opinions differ, a third and binding opinion may be required at the\nemployer’s expense.  The third health care provider must be approved jointly by\nthe employer and the employee.  The employer and the employee must each act in\ngood faith to reach agreement on the third opinion provider.  If the employer\ndoes not act in good faith, the employer will be bound by the first medical\ncertification.  If the employee does not act in good faith, the employee will\nbe bound by the second medical certification. (4)  Upon request by\nthe employee, the employer must provide copies of second or third opinions\nwithin five business days absent extenuating circumstances. (5)  If a second or\nthird opinion health care provider requests relevant medical information from\nan employee’s (or his or her family member’s) health care provider, and the\nemployee (or his or her family member) does not authorize his or her health\ncare provider to release relevant medical information, the employer may deny\nthe FMLA leave. 29 USC 2613(c) and (d)29 CFR 825.307(b) - (e) (f)   Medical\ncertification abroad In circumstances in\nwhich the employee or family member is visiting another country, or a family\nmember resides in another country, and a serious health condition develops, employers\nmust accept medical certifications, including second and third opinions, from a\nhealth care provider who practices in that country.  If a certification by a\nforeign health care provider is not in English, the employee must provide a\nwritten translation at the employer’s request. 29 CFR 825.307(f) (g)   Recertification (1)  An employer may\nrequest a recertification for leave taken because of an employee’s own serious\nhealth condition or the serious health condition of a family member. \nGenerally, an employer may ask for recertification no more frequently than\nevery 30 days and only in connection with an absence by the employee.  However,\nif the minimum duration indicated on the medical certification exceeds 30 days,\nan employer must wait the indicated minimum duration before requesting a\nrecertification (unless the exception in (g)(5) below applies).  In all cases,\nhowever, an employer may request a recertification of a medical condition every\nsix months in connection with an absence by the employee.  This could apply\nwhen, for example, the health care provider indicates a condition will last “a\nlifetime”. (2)  The employer\nmay ask for the same information as permitted for the initial medical\ncertification.  In addition, the employer may provide a record of the employee’s\nabsence pattern to the health care provider and ask if the serious health\ncondition and need for leave is consistent with such pattern. (3)  The employer\nmust allow at least 15 calendar days for the employee to provide the requested\nrecertification, unless it is not practicable under the particular\ncircumstances despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts. (4)  The employer\nmay contact the health care provider to authenticate or clarify the\nrecertification.  No second or third opinions may be required on a\nrecertification.  The recertification is at the employee’s expense. (5)  Less than 30\ndays exception An employer may request recertification in less\nthan 30 days if: a.     The\nemployee requests an extension of leave, or b.     Circumstances\ndescribed by the previous certification have changed significantly (for\nexample, if the certification stated the employee needed leave for one to two\ndays for a particular serious health condition and the employee’s absences for that\ncondition lasted four days each the last two times leave was needed, the\nincreased duration might constitute a significant change), or c.     The\nemployer receives information that casts doubt upon the employee’s stated\nreason for the absence or the continuing validity of the certification. (6)  When\nrecertification is not permitted Recertification does not apply to leave taken\nfor a qualifying exigency or to care for a covered servicemember with a serious\ninjury or illness (military caregiver leave). 29
