  "text": "29\nCFR part 541 provides examples of particular occupations to demonstrate how to\napply the regulatory concepts defining the exemptions in those situations. Some\nof the examples were also presented in the prior regulations. Note that while\nthe examples may be useful in understanding how to apply the regulations to\nspecific occupations, in order for an exemption to apply in a particular case,\nit is still necessary to confirm that an employee actually performs exempt\nduties and meets all other tests for the particular exemption claimed under 29 CFR\npart 541. Likewise, the examples cited below, when taken from opinion letters\nissued by the Wage and Hour Administrator, respond to a fact-specific inquiry. Certain\nexamples below include only summaries taken from opinion letters. The opinion\nletter cited should be reviewed for a fuller discussion. A slight difference in\nthe facts may result in a different outcome. Also, while the examples may\nprovide useful guidance regarding the application of 29 CFR part 541 for a\nparticular occupation, it must be remembered that a job title alone is\ninsufficient to establish the exempt status of an employee. The exempt or\nnonexempt status of any employee must be determined on the basis of whether the\nemployee’s salary and duties meet the requirements of the regulations. 29\nCFR § 541.2",
