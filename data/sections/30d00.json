  "text": "(a)  \nA “tipped employee”, as defined in section 3(t) of FLSA, is\nany employee engaged in an occupation in which the individual customarily and\nregularly receives more than $30.00 a month in tips. (b)  \nSection 3(m) of FLSA makes clear the intent of Congress to\nplace on the employer the burden of proving the amount of tips received\nby “tipped employees”, and the amount of tip credit, if any, which the employer\nmay claim. Since Sec 3(m) is not an exemption from the MW, but merely allows\nthe employer to claim up to 40 percent of the MW as tip credit, the employer is\nresponsible for ascertaining that the MW provisions are complied with in\ncompensating “tipped employees”. (c)  \n(1) The tip provision applies on\nan individual employee basis. Thus, an employer may claim the tip credit for             some\nemployees even though the employer cannot meet the requirements for others. (2) In establishments\nwhere employees perform a variety of different jobs, an employee’s status as\none who       “customarily and regularly receives tips” will depend on the\ntotal fact situation and will be determined on       the basis of such\nemployee’s activities over the entire w/w. (d)  \nWhen an individual is employed in a tipped occupation and a\nnon-tipped occupation (dual jobs), the tip credit is available only for the\nhours spent in the tipped occupation.  Also, such employee must customarily and\nregularly receive at least $30 a month in tips. (e)  \nReg 531.56(e) permits the taking of the tip credit for time\nspent in duties related to the tipped occupation, even though such duties are\nnot by themselves directed toward producing tips (i.e. maintenance and preparatory\nor closing activities).  For example a waiter/waitress, who spends some time\ncleaning and setting tables, making coffee, and occasionally washing dishes or\nglasses may continue to be engaged in a tipped occupation even though these\nduties are not tip producing, provided such duties are incidental to the\nregular duties of the server (waiter/waitress) and are generally assigned to\nthe servers.  However, where the facts indicate that specific employees are\nroutinely assigned to maintenance, or that tipped employees spend a substantial\namount of time (in excess of 20 percent) performing general preparation work or\nmaintenance, no tip credit may be taken for the time spent in such duties.",
