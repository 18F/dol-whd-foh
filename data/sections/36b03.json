  "text": "(a)   After\nestablishing statutory coverage, coverage under 29 CFR 1928.110 needs to be\nestablished.  Agricultural employers that have employed 11 or more workers “on\nany given day in hand-labor operations in the field” during the preceding 12\nmonths must provide field sanitation facilities. 29 CFR 1928.110(a).   (b)   The time span\nused to determine the number of employees controlled by the employer shall be\nthe single highest number employed at any one time over the past 12 months. \nOnly those employees who fall within the definition of “hand-labor operations”\nare to be counted.  Particular attention should be given to the excluded field\nor field-related activities when counting covered employees, as defined at 29 CFR\n1928.110(a)(iii).  At least 11 or more employees have to be working in the\nfield on any single day within the past 12 months.  Family members of the\nemployer are not counted for the purpose of determining whether there are\neleven hand laborers in the field.  Finally, the 11 or more workers may have\nworked in separate fields, and the number of employees is day specific (i.e., not\na collective or cumulative count).  The number of employees employed on the\ndate that the investigation does not determine coverage unless that number\nequals 11 or more workers. See 52 Fed. Reg. 16084; 02/06/1989 OSHA Memorandum  (c)   Hand-labor\nOperations:  Only employees engaged in hand-labor agricultural activities or\nagricultural operations, and only those employees engaged in hand-labor\noperations are to be counted towards the eleven or more workers.  Hand-labor\noperations refer to agricultural activities or agricultural operations\nperformed by hand or with hand tools.  Except for purposes of 29 CFR\n1928.110(c)(2)(iii), the term also includes other activities or operations\nperformed in conjunction with hand labor in the field.  Activities such as\nhand-cultivation, hand-weeding, hand-planting and hand-harvesting of\nvegetables, nuts, fruits, seedlings or other crops, and the hand-packing of\nproduce into containers, whether done on the ground, on a moving machine or in\na temporary packing shed located in the field, are all examples of hand-labor\noperations.  Hand-labor is defined as activities “on the ground, on a moving\nmachine or in a temporary packing shed located in the field.”  Machine Operators:  Those operating machines in\nconjunction with hand-laborers, such as tractor drivers pulling the platform\nfrom which the hand-labor occurs, are also covered. For example, if an employer\nhas a tractor effectively working as part of a crew in a field, the tractor\noperator is to be treated as a hand laborer for the purpose of calculating the\nnumber of hand laborers working in the field. 29 CFR 1928.110(b); 52 Fed. Reg. 16086-16087. (d)   Mushroom farms: \nhand-labor operations in growing mushrooms, whether inside permanent structures\nor not, are expressly covered under the field sanitation standard.             52 Fed. Reg. 16087 (e)   Workers in\npermanent greenhouse structures, packing or canning workers in permanent\nstructures, workers engaged in logging or livestock operations, or those\nworking on agricultural machinery not in conjunction with hand-laborers are not\ncovered by the field sanitation standard.               29 CFR 1928.110(b); 52 Fed.
