  "text": "(a)   The word “local” modifies only the words\n“trolley or motorbus”. The indispensable characteristic of a local motorbus\ncarrier is that it is a carrier which serves an integrated commercial or industrial\narea for the purposes of carrying persons to and from their work in offices and\nfactories, children to and from school daily, and other persons attending to\nnecessary routine business. If a carrier does not meet this test, it is not\nexempt. On the other hand, the mere serving, as above, of an integrated\ncommercial area by a carrier would not conclusively establish the fact that\nsuch a carrier is local unless it has generally the following characteristics,\nthe first three of which are the most significant: (1) \nThe fare on a local\nbus route is either paid to the driver directly or deposited in a coin box.\nTickets are not sold at terminals or other designated places for single trips.\nSchool tickets, weekly passes, or commutation tickets are in some instances,\nhowever, used on local carriers. (2) \nThe fare on a local\nbus route is either a single fare for the entire route, or is based on the\nnumber of zones through which a person travels. The fare is not based on the\nnumber of miles traveled. (3) \nBuses of a local\ncarrier traverse the same route at frequent intervals, usually with a “headway”\nof less than 1 hour, and make frequent stops at designated places, ordinarily\nspaced at a given number of feet. These operating schedules are generally\nspeeded up during the morning and evening peak periods. (4) \nThe buses used on\nlocal routes differ from the over-the-road buses in that the seats in the\nformer are more narrowly spaced and the aisle is wider to accommodate standees. (5) \nLocal buses are built\nnot to exceed a speed of approximately 45 miles per hour, while the top speed\nof the over-the-road bus is much higher. (6) \nLocal buses are\ngeared for the quick acceleration necessary for short runs in congested\ntraffic. (7) \nLocal buses do not\nmaintain space for baggage, having at best a package rack for small items such\nas lunch boxes and packaged merchandise. Over-the-road buses have space set\naside in the rear, on the roof, or within the bus for the luggage commonly\nrequired in traveling considerable distances. (8) \nDrivers of local\nbuses are ordinarily paid on an hourly rather than a mileage basis. (9) \nDrivers of local\nbuses do not make runs which prevent them from returning home each day after\nwork. (10) \nLocal bus carriers do\nnot maintain schedules designed to make connections with over-the-road\ncarriers, nor are they engaged in carriage which is a continuation of\nover-the-road travel, preliminary thereto, or a part thereof. (11) \nThe statistical\npattern of national over-the-road travel indicates a falling off of business\nduring the fall, winter, and early spring months with a sharp increase during\nthe late spring months and summer traceable to pleasure trips taken during\nvacation periods. The statistical pattern for local bus travel depicts a low\ndegree of travel during the late spring months and summer. (b)   The crossing of State lines does not of\nitself change the local character of a carrier if the tests set out in (a)\nabove are met.",
