  "text": "(a)   Davis-Bacon coverage under ARRA.  (1) \nAAM #207 outlined the\napplicability of the DB labor standards to ARRA funded projects. The ARRA was\nsigned by President Obama on February 17, 2009. The ARRA appropriated\nsubstantial funding for construction, alteration and repair of Federal\nbuildings and for infrastructure projects. Federal agencies directly\ncontracting for construction work are required by existing DBA requirements to\nensure that bid solicitations and resulting contracts contain DB labor\nstandards and WDs. Federal agencies must ensure that recipients of assistance\nunder ARRA require contractors and subcontractors to pay laborers and mechanics\non Federally-assisted construction projects at least the prevailing wages as\ndetermined under the DBA. Specifically, Section 1606 of Division A of ARRA\nstates that DBA’s prevailing wage requirement applies to ARRA-appropriated\nconstruction projects, as follows: “Notwithstanding any other provision of law\nand in a manner consistent with other provisions of this Act, all laborers and\nmechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors on projects funded\ndirectly by or assisted in whole or in part by and through the Federal\ngovernment pursuant to this Act shall be paid wages at rates not less than\nthose prevailing on projects of a character similar in the locality as\ndetermined by the Secretary of Labor… .” The language “notwithstanding any other provision of\nlaw” explicitly overrides any limitation to Davis-Bacon coverage that may be\ncontained in other Davis-Bacon Related Acts. Therefore, if a construction\nproject is funded under multiple statutes, including one with a pre-existing\nDavis-Bacon related Act provision as well as ARRA, then the ARRA prevailing\nwage requirement applies if any such ARRA assistance is provided for the\nproject. Two provisions of ARRA exempt certain tribal contracts\nfrom Section 1606. One provision states that section 1606 does not apply “to\ntribal contracts entered into by the Bureau of Indian Affairs” with the\nappropriations provided under ARRA for repair and restoration of roads; school\nimprovements, repairs and replacement construction; and detention center\nmaintenance and repairs. A second provision states that section 1606 does not\napply “to tribal contracts entered into by the [HHS Indian Health] Service\"\nwith the ARRA appropriation for Indian health facilities construction projects.\nOf course, even though ARRA does not apply DB to those projects, if the\nprojects receive funding under another related Act that requires DB prevailing\nwage requirements, those requirements would continue to apply. Prevailing wage coverage under ARRA-assisted projects\nmust be determined in the same manner as under the DBA. ARRA-assisted projects\nmust follow the requirements in regulations 29 CFR 1, 3 and 5. (2) \nAAM # 208 outlined the\napplicability of the DB labor standards to projects financed with the proceeds\nof the five tax-favored bonds listed in section 1601 of Division B of ARRA. It\nalso highlighted the responsibilities of state and local governmental entities,\ncontractors, and others for implementation of, and compliance with, the\nDavis-Bacon labor standards in connection with projects financed with the\nproceeds of the tax-favored bonds. Specifically, Section 1601 of Division B of ARRA provides\nthat the DBA’s prevailing wage requirement applies to projects financed with\nthe proceeds of:                                              \na.     Any new clean renewable energy bond (as defined in\nsection 54C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) issued after the date of the\nenactment of ARRA Division B.                                             \nb.     Any qualified energy conservation bond (as defined in\nsection 4D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) issued after the date of the\nenactment of ARRA Division B.                                              \nc.     Any qualified zone academy bond (as defined in section\n54E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) issued after the date of the\nenactment of ARRA Division B.                                             \nd.     Any qualified school construction bond (as defined in\nsection 54F of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).                                              \ne.     Any recovery zone economic development bond (as\ndefined in section 1400U–2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986). An entity (usually a state or local government agency)\nwith contracting responsibility for a project financed with the proceeds of one\nof the five tax-favored bonds must cause or require the contracting officer for\nthe project, at least as soon as the entity receives notice of ARRA assistance\nwith respect to the project, to insert in full the standard D-B contract\nclauses found in 29 CFR 5.5(a) (and the applicable wage determination in effect\nat the time of notice of ARRA assistance) in bid solicitations and covered\nconstruction contracts that are in excess of $2,000 for construction,\nalteration or repair (including painting and decorating). The requirement to insert the standard D-B contract\nclauses and attach the applicable wage determination in effect at the time of\nnotice of ARRA assistance applies regardless of the amount or form of ARRA\nfunding or assistance. Thus, coverage under section 1601 of Division B of ARRA\ncan exist even if a project is financed only in part by proceeds of one of the\nbonds listed in section 1601. If bond proceeds are pooled in a general fund or\notherwise, then every project financed in whole or in part by the pooled\nproceeds is subject to Davis-Bacon requirements provided that other applicable\ncoverage criteria are satisfied. (b)  Weatherization contracts. Using ARRA appropriations,\nthe Department of Energy awards grants under the Weatherization Assistance\nProgram to state-level government agencies. These agencies then contract with\nlocal agencies, usually Community Action Agencies, to deliver weatherization\nservices to eligible residents. Individuals and families apply for assistance\nthrough the local agencies. If approved for services, professionally trained\nweatherization assistance program technicians perform on-site audits to identify\ncost-effective measures that can be taken. Crews then make the repairs and\nimprovements to increase energy efficiency. The technicians conducting the\naudits are typically employees of the governmental or community action agency.\nThe repair crews typically work for contractors.  It is WHD’s longstanding\nposition that governmental agencies are not contractors or subcontractors\nwithin the meaning of the DBA when the construction is performed by their own\nemployees on a “force account” basis. (See FOH 15b06.) However, laborers or\nmechanics employed by a private, non-profit Community Action Agency cannot be\nconsidered as force account labor and will be covered under the DB labor\nstandards requirements when performing ARRA-assisted weatherization work. In addition,\nwhen the Community Action Agency contracts out work that is assisted with ARRA\nfunding, the Agency must apply the DB labor standards and appropriate WD to the\ncontract. Therefore, repair crews performing the duties of laborers or\nmechanics for a Community Action Agency or its contractors must be paid at\nleast the DB prevailing wage. Certain activities such as energy audits and\ninspections are not viewed as construction work performed by laborers or\nmechanics within the meaning of the DBA. (c)   State Energy Program (SEP) and individual homeowners. DOE, through its Office of\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), operates a State Energy Program\n(SEP) that provides grants to States that may be used to fund individual\nStates’ SEP plans. These grants are funded in whole or in part by ARRA. An\nindividual homeowner who receives a rebate for material and/or labor costs he\nor she has incurred in connection with qualifying energy efficiency and\nweatherization improvements to his or her home under a DOE SEP rebate program\nis not responsible for Davis-Bacon compliance. This general interpretation\naddresses only whether Davis-Bacon labor standards apply to individual\nhomeowners who receive a rebate, funded in whole or in part by ARRA, to\nreimburse them pursuant to DOE programs for certain energy efficiency and\nweatherization improvements to their homes.",
