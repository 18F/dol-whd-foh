  "text": "(a)   Where\nuniforms are required by law, employer, or type of work If the wearing of clean uniforms is required by\nlaw, by the employer, or by the nature of the work, the financial burden of\nfurnishing or maintaining these clean uniforms may not be imposed upon the\nemployees if to do so would reduce their wages below the MW (see Reg\n531.3(d)(2), 531.32(c) and 531.35). (b)   Cost of and\ntime spent in maintaining uniforms (1)  Where employee\nuniforms require ironing, drycleaning, daily washing, commercial laundering, or\nother special treatment, because of heavy soiling in work usage or in order to\nmeet cleanliness or appearance standards set by law, by an employer, or by the\nnature of the work, the employees must, absent documentation of the greater or\nlesser cost, be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs which reduce their\nwages below the MW in accordance with the amounts set forth in (b)(3) below. (2)  However, in\nthose instances where uniforms are (a) made of “wash and wear” materials, (b)\nmay be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and (c) do not\nrequire ironing or any other special treatment such as drycleaning, daily washing,\nor commercial laundering, WH will not require that employees be reimbursed for\nuniform maintenance costs. This position is not applicable where daily washing\nis required and the employer furnishes or reimburses the employee for a single\nuniform. (3)  For enforcement\npurposes, WH will accept the payment to the employee of $3.35 per week or 67\ncents per day as satisfying this requirement. (4)  Since the\nuniform cost would presumably be the same for any day, regardless of the number\nof hours worked, allocating this cost on an hourly basis should be avoided\nexcept as in (d)(2) below. However, if an employer pays on a “cents-per-hour”\nbasis, no monetary violation will exist if the employees receive the full daily\nand/or weekly amounts in each w/w as indicated in (3) above. (5)  Where this\nenforcement position is followed, the time spent in washing uniforms will not\nbe considered hours worked for either MW or OT pay purposes. (6)  Employers or\nemployees are free to establish actual costs, as indicated in (d) below. (c)   Employee\nchooses not to use employer’s free laundry service Where an employer gives notice to employees\nthat the employer will launder or clean all uniforms required to be worn by\nemployees, free of any charge, and all or some employees elect not to avail\nthemselves of such service, the employer will not be required to reimburse the\nemployees for expenses incurred by them for laundering or cleaning their\nuniforms on their own. (d)   Other\nstandards for determination of cost (1)  The enforcement\nposition in (b)(3) above does not prohibit the determination of the cost of\nlaundering or maintaining uniforms from being made on some other basis, so long\nas the actual cost does not cut into required MW or OT compensation. For\nexample, where an employer contracts with a laundry or rental service and in\nturn charges the employees or requires the employees to bear the cost directly,\nthe actual cost may be used if reasonable. (2)  Similarly,\nwhere a specific amount has been negotiated under a bona fide collective\nbargaining agreement (e.g., 5c for each hour worked), this amount may be used,\nif reasonable. (3)  Where the\nemployer does not use the flat daily or weekly basis set forth in subsec (b)(3)\nabove, it is essential that the CO determine and document in the case file the\nactual cost incurred by the employee. (4)  In preparing a\ncase for settlement or for litigation, the enforcement position in subsec\n(b)(3) cannot be relied upon as a basis for action where the employer uses\nanother basis for reimbursing employees for uniform maintenance expenses. (e)   Cost of\npurchasing and repurchasing uniforms (1)  When an\nemployee is required to purchase a uniform, the employee must be reimbursed for\nthe cost of the uniform to the extent that the expense cuts into the MW or OT\ncompensation required by FLSA/PCA/SCA/CWHSSA. (2)  This\nreimbursement must be made promptly on the regular payday for the w/w in which\nthe expense was incurred and may not be spread over the life of the garment. (3)  Further,\nemployers may not avoid such costs by requiring employees to obtain uniforms\nbefore starting the job. In such a case, the cost of the uniform is, in effect,\nan advance of an expense that must be borne by the employer. (4)  On the other\nhand, where an employee already has a uniform which has been paid for by the\nfirm, and the employee is paid at least the MW and proper OT and there is a\nclear understanding between the employer and the employee that so much per hour\nwill be paid in addition to the MW for the sole purpose of replacing an\nexisting uniform, and, in fact, the amount so paid is sufficient to purchase\nreplacement uniforms when worn out or no longer serviceable, no violation would\noccur. (f)   Definition\nof “uniforms” (1)  Although there\nare no hard-and-fast rules in determining whether certain types of dress are\nconsidered uniforms for purposes of Sec 3(m), the following principles are\napplicable:                                              \na.     If\nan employer merely prescribes a general type of ordinary basic street clothing\nto be worn while working and permits variations in details of dress, the\ngarments chosen by the employees would not be considered to be uniforms.                                              \nb.     On\nthe other hand, where the employer does prescribe a specific type and style of\nclothing to be worn at work, e.g. where a restaurant or hotel requires a tuxedo\nor a skirt and blouse or jacket of a specific or distinctive style, color, or\nquality, such clothing would be considered uniforms.                                              \nc.     Other\nexamples would include uniforms required to be worn by guards, cleaning and\nculinary personnel, and hospital and nursing home personnel. (g)   Employee\nelects to buy additional uniforms. in excess of number required Where an employer supplies, free of charge, or\nreimburses the employees for a sufficient number of uniforms required to be\nworn, and all or some employees elect to purchase additional uniforms in excess\nof the number required, the employer will not be required to reimburse the\nemployees for costs incurred in purchasing uniforms in excess of the required\nnumber. (h)  For the\napplication of these principles on uniforms under SCA, see FOH 14f01 and Reg\n4.168(b).",
