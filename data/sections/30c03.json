Where the primary benefit of\nsuch facilities is to the employer’s business interest, credit will be denied.\nThe following are commonly viewed as furnished primarily for the benefit or\nconvenience of employees: (1)  Meals Meals furnished by the\nemployer are regarded as primarily for the benefit and convenience of the\nemployees. This rule does not apply, however, to the meal expenses incurred by\nan employee while traveling away from home on the employer’s business. (See IB\n778.217(b)(3).) (2)  Lodging Lodging, like meals,\nis ordinarily considered for the benefit and convenience of the employee.\nCircumstances may exist, however, where housing is of little benefit to\nemployees, as where an employer requires an employee to live on the employer’s\npremises to meet some need of the employer, or where the employee must travel\naway from home to further the employer’s business. In such circumstances, the\nhousing will be considered as primarily benefiting the employer. (Note: while\nit may be to the employer’s advantage to provide such facilities at or near the\nworksite, courts have consistently taken the view that the employer may take a\nwage credit when the facilities are primarily for the benefit or convenience of\nthe employee.) (3)  Transportation                                              \na.     Transportation\nfurnished employees between their homes and work (i.e. normal, daily\nhome-to-work travel) where the travel time does not constitute hours worked is\ngenerally an “other facility.” However, transportation which is an incident of\nor necessary to the employment is not an “other facility.” (See FOH 30c13\nregarding transportation of migrant and seasonal agricultural workers.)                                              \nb.     Transportation\nfurnished for normal home to work travel from a voluntary assembly point to a job\nsite and vice versa where the time does not constitute hours of work and the\ntransportation is primarily for the benefit of the employees is an “other\nfacility.” In contrast, travel to distant or remote job sites is normally for\nthe employer’s benefit and does not qualify as an “other facility.”                                              \nc.     Cars\nfurnished by an employer to employees primarily for the personal transportation\nuse of the employees and not primarily for company business are “facilities”\nfor which a wage credit may be claimed by the employer. (See FOH 30c11\nregarding demonstrators used by automobile salespersons.) (4)  Merchandise Goods or merchandise,\nsuch as clothing and appliances, may be considered “other facilities” under Sec\n3(m) and Reg 531. Only the actual cost to the employer (not necessarily the\nretail cost) may be taken as a wage credit. (5)  Tuition\nexpenses Tuition furnished to\nan employee for courses or training for the individual’s own personal benefit\nis a bona fide “facility” for which a wage credit may be taken, unless the\ntraining is related to employment or is required to retain employment. (6)  Child care Child care facilities\nwhich are furnished by an employer are bona fide “facilities” for which a wage\ncredit may be taken.",
