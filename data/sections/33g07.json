  "text": "(a)  \nAs part of our YouthRules!\ninitiative, WH has produced a supply of special “STOP” stickers which employers\nmay place on hazardous equipment to alert workers that they must be at least 18\nyears of age to operate and/or clean the equipment.  The stickers are\nappropriate for use on meat slicers, forklifts, balers, compactors,\npower-driven bakery equipment, freight elevators, power saws, etc.  These stickers\nmay also be downloaded from the YouthRules! Website. (b)  \nThere are three versions of these\nstickers:   (1)  One warns employees that they must be “18 TO OPERATE\nOR CLEAN THIS EQUIPMENT” and encourages the reader to contact WH for more\ninformation about the CL laws (see Exhibit A below). (2)  One states “NO OPERATORS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE” and\nencourages the reader to contact the Wage and Hour Division for more\ninformation about the CL laws (see Exhibit B below).  (3)  The third sticker, designed exclusively for use on forklifts\nin nonagricultural work places, states in English and Spanish “No operators\nunder 18 years of age—IT’S THE LAW.”  The forklift stop sticker was developed\nin conjunction with the Massachusetts Department of Health and the National\nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health (see Exhibit C\nbelow).  (c)  \nEmployers who use these stickers\nshould place them in conspicuous spots on the equipment, but never cover up\nother important information such as safety instructions, model numbers, or\nemergency guidelines. (d)  \nUse of the stickers does not\nremove, in any way, an employer’s obligation to ensure compliance with all CL\nprovisions at all times.  Exhibit A  Exhibit B  Exhibit C",
