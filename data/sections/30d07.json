  "text": "An employer may not take a higher tip credit\nduring overtime hours than is taken during non-overtime hours.  Under Sec.\n3(m), the amount of the tip credit is the difference between the direct wage\npaid (which cannot be less than $2.13 per hour) and the Sec. 6(a)(1) minimum\nwage.  This formula determines the maximum amount of an employee’s tips that\ncan be considered wages per hour during the workweek.  Where an employer pays a\ndirect wage of $2.13 and claims a tip credit of $5.12 per hour, the employee’s\nregular rate would be $7.25 per hour and the employee’s wage for overtime hours\nwould be $10.88 (of which $5.12 may be a tip credit and $5.76 would be a direct\nwage payment).  See FOH 32 regarding overtime computations for tipped\nemployees.  (Rev. 563, 12/9/88)",
