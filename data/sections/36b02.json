  "text": "Statutory coverage under the OSHAct exists where\nthere is a person who meets the definition of an employer who employs at least\none employee.  Under Sec. 3 of the OSHAct, person is defined as “…one or more\nindividuals, partnerships, associations, corporations, business trusts, legal\nrepresentatives, or any organized group of persons.”  An employer “means a\nperson engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees,” and an\nemployee “means an employee of an employer who is employed in a business of his\nemployer which affects commerce.” Commerce means trade, traffic, commerce,\ntransportation, or communication among the several States, or between a State\nand any place outside thereof, or within the District of Columbia, or a\npossession of the United Sates, or between points in the same State but through\na point outside thereof.  As used in the OSHAct, the terms affects commerce and\naffecting commerce are, for all intents and purposes, synonymous. (Note: \nAffects commerce appears in the statutory definition of employee, and affecting\ncommerce is in the definition of employer.)  Although not defined in the\nstatute, both affects commerce and affecting commerce describe the breadth of\nactivities relative to commerce which govern whether the Act applies. Conceptually, the terms affects and affecting\ncommerce include, but are more expansive than, the FLSA term engaged in\ncommerce or the production of goods for commerce.  OSHA, the Occupational\nSafety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC - see FOH 36f), and the courts have\nconsistently construed affects and affecting commerce so as to have the\nbroadest possible application. In summary, in order to determine whether the OSHAct\napplies to a given agricultural employer, the employer needs to be engaging in\ncommerce or affecting commerce.  This is somewhat broader than the FLSA\nlanguage “engaged in commerce.”  An employer not “engaging in commerce” could\nbe considered to affect commerce.  Secondly, the agricultural establishment\nmust be an employer, and lastly, the employer must have employees who affect\ncommerce.  Note that the concept of employee is controlled by what the employer\ndoes, not by what the employee does. Nothing in the OSHAct’s coverage is conceptually\nparallel to individual coverage under the FLSA.  Also, no dollar volume test\nexists under OSHAct.  It applies to employers regardless of their annual dollar\nvolume of business.  It also apples to employers who would be otherwise exempt\nfrom the provisions of MSPA, (i.e. the family farm exemption).  No comparable\nexemptions exist under the OSHAct. Statutory coverage cannot be presumed, it must be\naffirmatively established and documented for every case.  Once statutory\ncoverage is established, it must be determined whether the employer is subject\nto either (or both) the FS and TLC regulations. 29 USC 651, et. seq.",
