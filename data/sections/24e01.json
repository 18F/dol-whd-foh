  "text": "(a)   DOT has held that drivers, driver’s\nhelpers, loaders, and mechanics engaged in activities which directly affect the\nsafe operation of motor vehicles in interstate commerce will be subject to its\njurisdiction under Sec 204 of the Motor Carrier Act. This applies to such\nemployees who are employed by a common, contract, or private carrier which has\nengaged in the interstate transportation of goods. In the case of a common\ncarrier that has solicited interstate transportation business pursuant to a\nvalid I.C.C. certificate, it would not be necessary to have actually engaged in\nthe interstate transportation of goods. (b)   Where a driver or driver’s helper has not\nmade an actual interstate trip, or a loader or mechanic has not been working on\nan interstate shipment or vehicle which has been utilized in such a shipment,\nthey may still be subject to DOT’s jurisdiction, if: (1) \nThe carrier is shown\nto have an involvement in interstate commerce and, (2) \nIt can be established\nthat the driver or driver’s helper could have, in the regular course of his/her\nemployment, been reasonably expected to make one of the carrier’s interstate\nruns or, in the case of a loader or mechanic, could have been reasonably\nexpected to perform as such in the carrier’s interstate activity. Satisfactory\nevidence of the above could take the form of statements from the carrier’s\nemployees, or documentation such as employment agreements. Where such evidence\nis developed with regard to an employee, DOT will assert jurisdiction over that\nemployee for a 4-month period beginning with the date they could have been\ncalled upon to, or actually did, engage in the carrier’s interstate activity.\nThus, such employees would be exempt under Sec 13(b)(l) for the same 4-month period,\nnotwithstanding references to the contrary contained in IB 782.2. (c)   Where it is not clear whether this\nexemption will apply to a carrier’s drivers, driver’s helpers, loaders, and\nmechanics, the following information should be developed and forwarded to the\nAA/OFLS: (1) \nWith regard to the\ncarrier:                                              \na.     The extent to which it is involved in\ninterstate commerce;                                              \nb.     Evidence, in the case of a common carrier\nwhich has not engaged in interstate transportation, that it has solicited such\nbusiness; and                                              \nc.     Whether it operates pursuant to a valid\nICC certificate. (2) \nWith regard to the\nemployees in question:                                              \na.     The degree to which their duties affect\nthe safety of operation of motor vehicles on the public highways in interstate\ncommerce;                                              \nb.     The frequency with which they engage in\nthe duties of a driver, driver’s helper, loader, or mechanic in an interstate\nactivity; and                                              \nc.     Evidence that they could be called upon\nto perform the duties of a driver, driver’s helper, loader, or mechanic in an\ninterstate activity. (3) \nAny other pertinent\ninformation regarding the exempt status of the carrier’s employees.",
