  "text": "(a)   The FBs that an employer is required to furnish\nemployees performing on a covered contract will be specified in the applicable\nWD included in the contract documents. (1) \nAny administrative costs (e.g.,\nrecordkeeping costs associated with payroll administration) incurred by a\ncontractor directly in providing FB plans are considered business expenses of\nthe firm and not contributions made on behalf of the employees. Such\nadministrative costs cannot be credited toward meeting the FB obligations of the\napplicable WD. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.172.)  (2) \nThe cost incurred by a Government\ncontractor’s insurance carrier (or third party trust fund) in its\nadministration and delivery of benefits to service employees can be credited\ntoward the contractor’s FB obligations under an SCA WD. (b)  FB obligations may be discharged by furnishing any\nequivalent combination of cash or bona fide FBs. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.170, 4.177.) (c)   The terms “equivalent fringe benefit” and “cash\nequivalent” mean equal in terms of monetary cost to the contractor. (See 29\nC.F.R. 4.177(a)(3).) (d)  It is the contractor’s responsibility to satisfy the\nFB obligations set forth in an SCA WD. The contractor may choose the FBs to be\nprovided, whether an employee accepts or refuses the FBs offered. If an\nemployee desires cash payments or benefits other than those chosen by the\ncontractor, that would be a matter for discussion and resolution between the\nemployee and the employer. If the contractor furnished a lesser amount of the\nFBs called for by the applicable WD, the contractor must furnish the employee\nwith the difference between the amount stated in the WD and the actual cost of\nthe FB which the contractor provided. As set forth in 29 C.F.R. 4.175(a)(2),\nthe contractor may make up the difference in cash to the employee, or furnish\nequivalent benefits, or a combination thereof. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.177.) (e)   If participation in the FB plan requires a\ncontribution from the employee’s wages, whether through payroll deduction or\notherwise, the employee’s concurrence is necessary. No contribution toward FBs\nmade by employees, or deducted from their wages, may be included or used by an\nemployer in satisfying any part of any FB obligation under the Act. (See 29 C.F.R.\n4.168(a).) (f)   Service employees employed by a single employer are\nentitled to FB payments only up to a maximum of 40 hours per week, regardless\nof the number of contracts on which they work, unless otherwise specified by\nthe applicable WD. This position only affects covered contracts subject to\n“prevailing” WDs with the “fixed cost” per employee H&W, paid vacation and\nholiday benefits. Service employees who work for a single employer on multiple\ncontracts which may have other requirements, such as a collectively bargained\nFB or an “average cost” H&W FB, may be entitled to FB payments in excess of\n40 hours per week. (See Dantran, Inc. v. U.S. DOL, 171 F.3d 58 (1st Cir.\n1999).) (g)   The FB requirements under successor contracts subject\nto SCA Section 4(c) are included in 29 C.F.R. 4.163. Terms of the CBA will\ndictate eligibility requirements, and the amount and extent of such FBs. Since\na successor contractor’s obligations are governed by the terms of the CBA, any\ninterpretation of the wage and FB provisions of the CBA where they are unclear\nmust be based on the intent of the parties, provided that such interpretation\ndoes not violate the law. Some of the principles discussed in the regulations\nregarding specific interpretations of the FB provisions of prevailing WDs may\nnot be applicable to WDs issued pursuant to Section 4(c). The provisions of Section\n4(c), however, do not supersede the provision of Section 2(a)(2) of the Act\nthat allows a contractor to satisfy its FB obligations by furnishing any\nequivalent combinations of FBs or by making equivalent or differential payments\nin cash. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.163(j), 4.177.)",
