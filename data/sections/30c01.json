  "text": "(a)   Section\n3(m) of FLSA permits an employer, under conditions specified in Reg 531, to\ncount toward its MW obligation, the “reasonable cost” of furnishing board,\nlodging, or other facilities which are customarily furnished to employees. Sec\n3(m) also authorizes the Secretary to determine the “fair value” of the board,\nlodging, or other facilities based upon average cost to the employer or to\ngroups of employers similarly situated, or on the average value to groups of\nemployees. Where “reasonable cost” under Sec 3(m) has been established by an\nemployer and appears to be excessive in relation to the facilities furnished,\nit will be necessary to ascertain whether the “fair value” of the facilities in\nquestion is lower than the “reasonable cost”. If so, the employer must use the\n“fair value” rather than the “reasonable cost” in determining its wage\nobligation. In no case will the “fair value” be utilized where it is greater\nthan the “reasonable cost”. (b)   The cost\nof board, lodging, or other facilities shall not be included as wages to the\nextent excluded therefrom under the terms of a bona fide collective bargaining\nagreement applicable to the particular employee. In most cases, a determination\nwhether such an exclusion exists will be based upon the written provisions of\nthe collective bargaining agreement. (c)   Employees\nmust receive the benefit of the facility for which the employer is taking a\nwage credit. Moreover, the reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing board,\nlodging, or other facilities (or the fair value thereof) must be included in\nthe employee’s R/R of pay for the purpose of computing OT pay.",
