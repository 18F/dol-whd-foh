  "text": "(a)  \nNumerous hours worked questions\nmay arise with respect to employees engaged in ambulance services. The most\ncommon are as follows: (1)  Less than 24 hours duty. Ambulance employees who are\nrequired to be on duty at their employer’s place of business for periods of\nless than 24 hours are working even though they are permitted to sleep or\nengage in other personal activities when not busy. (See IB 785.21.) However,\nthe usual rules with respect to meal periods would apply when they are relieved\nof all duties for the purpose of eating meals. (2)  Duty of 24 hours or more. (See IB 785.22.) Some\nambulance employees may be required by the employer to be on duty on his\npremises for 24 hours or more. The parties may agree to exclude bona fide meal\nperiods and a regularly scheduled sleeping period of not more than 8 hours,\nprovided the employer furnishes adequate sleeping facilities and the employee\ncan usually enjoy uninterrupted sleep during the period. If the sleeping period\nis more than 8 hours, only 8 hours may be excluded from hours worked. Any\ninterruption of the sleeping period to respond to calls must be counted as\nhours worked. If the period is interrupted to such an extent that the employee\ncannot get a reasonable “night’s sleep”, the entire sleeping period must be\ncounted as hours worked. For enforcement purposes, the “night’s sleep” will be\nconsidered reasonable if the employee can get at least 5 hours sleep during the\nperiod. Thus, where these tests are met, the actual sleeping time (i.e., not\nless than 5 hours and not more than 8 hours) may be excluded from hours worked.\nOff-duty periods during which the employee has complete freedom from duties and\nmay leave the premises for his own purposes may also be excluded. (3)  Employees who reside on the employer’s premises\npermanently or for extended periods of time. Some ambulance service employees\nreside on their employer’s premises. In such cases, the employee is not working\nall the time he is on the premises. In determining hours worked, bona fide\noff-duty time need not be counted and any reasonable agreement of the parties\nwhich takes into consideration all the pertinent facts will be accepted. (See\nIB 785.23.) In the absence of an agreement, the Inv should make a reasonable\ndetermination giving recognition to the facts in the particular case which\nindicate the amount of time that the employee does have to eat, sleep, and\ndevote to his own pursuits. (4)  On-call time. Except where the employee is on duty 24\nhours or more or resides on the premises, time spent by an employee in an\n“on-call” status at his employer’s establishment is hours worked. On the other\nhand, where an employee is not required to remain on his employer’s premises\nbut is free to engage in his own pursuits and merely required to leave word\nwhere he may be reached, the time so spent is not considered to be hours\nworked. See IB 785.17.) If the employee does in fact go out on a call, the time\nactually spent in making the call including travel time is hours worked. Also,\nthere may be situations when calls are so frequent or the “on-call” conditions\nso restrictive that the employee is not really free to use the intervening\nperiods for his own benefit. In such cases he may be considered as “engaged to\nwait” rather than “waiting to be engaged” and the waiting time would also be\ncounted as hours worked. (5)  Employee who takes ambulance to his home. In the\nordinary case where an employer permits an employee to drive an ambulance to\nand from his home for the employee’s own convenience, the time so spent in\ndriving is not hours worked (see FOH 31c01). If the employee is required to\ntake the ambulance home in order to be able to respond to calls immediately,\nall the time spent in driving would be hours worked. The time the ambulance\nremains parked idly outside the employee’s residence, and the employee is free\nto engage in his own pursuits subject only to the understanding that he leave\nword at his home or with company officials where he may be reached, would not\nbe regarded as hours worked under the Act. The waiting time would be counted as\nhours worked only in situations of the type referred to in the last two\nsentences of paragraph (4). If the ambulance is parked at the employee’s home,\nthe employee would be considered working from the time he sets out on a call\nuntil the time he returns to his home.",
