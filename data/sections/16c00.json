Earnings\nare subjected to garnishment when the employer is legally bound to make\ndeductions from the earnings of an employee to satisfy a garnishment order.\nWhere a binding garnishment order absorbs all disposable earnings and the\nemployer may, therefore, not make deductions for additional garnishments until\nsatisfying the first order, sec 304 prohibits discharge from employment until\nthe employer is legally bound to withhold for the second garnishment. Thus, in\nsuch a case, there is no second garnishment until the second garnishment is\nactionable.",
