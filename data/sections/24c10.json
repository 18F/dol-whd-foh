  "text": "(a)   In the usual operation of an armored car\ncompany the vehicles transport checks drawn on out-of-State banks as well as\ncoins and currency to a bank for subsequent out-of-State transmittal. The\ntransportation to the main bank for further transmittal is part of a “practical\ncontinuity of movement” across State lines, making the Sec 13(b)(1) exemption\napplicable. (b)   On the other hand, there is a significant\ndifference with respect to route salespersons who pick up checks from their\ncustomers and turn them in to the office before they continue on to the bank\nfor subsequent out-of-State transmittal. Such checks must be credited on the\nfirm’s books, endorsed, and otherwise “processed” before depositing. Such\nprocessing in the office is sufficient to constitute a break in the interstate\nmovement, and Sec 13 (b)(l) would not be applicable.",
