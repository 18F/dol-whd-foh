  "text": "(a)   A bonus\nor other payment which would not be considered a part of the regular rate may\nnot be offset against the MW due under FLSA. However, where such payments would\nbe considered a part of the regular rate, they are included with other wages\nfor purposes of determining compliance with the MW provisions of FLSA. (See IB\n778.208 - 209.) (b)   Situations\nmay be encountered where the wages paid on the regular payday are not\nsufficient to satisfy the MW, but the employee at some subsequent date is paid\nadditional wages (for example, a production bonus) for those w/w’s included in\nthe bonus payment period. When the additional wages are added to the wages paid\non the regular payday, the results are either that the employee has received\nnot less than the MW for each hour worked during that week or that the amount\nof the MW deficiency has been reduced. In such situations, a monetary violation\nof the MW provisions exists since payment of not less than the MW required by\nFLSA must be made on the regular payday for each w/w (see FOH 30b04). However,\nwhere the additional wages for a particular w/w have actually been paid prior\nto the investigation, and they are sufficient to bring the employee’s wages up\nto the MW for each hour worked during that week, no MW violation shall be\nreported for that w/w. If such additional wages paid prior to the investigation\nare not sufficient to bring the employee’s earnings up to the MW for each hour\nworked during that week, the amount of the remaining MW deficiency shall be\ncomputed and reported. The employer shall be advised that no less than the MW\nmust be paid on each regular payday and the employer’s assurance of future\ncompliance shall be obtained.",
