On the other hand, where\npayment is made for a portion of the time spent in such travel, only that\nportion of the travel time which has been made compensable must be counted as\nhours worked. In this respect, where a partial payment is made and the\nemployer’s records do not indicate the portion of the travel time that is to be\ncompensated the intent of the parties and all the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding the agreement or understanding will determine what portion of the\ntravel time has been made compensable.",
