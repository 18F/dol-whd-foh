  "text": "(a)   The manufacture and delivery to the work site of\nsupply items such as sand, gravel, and ready-mixed concrete, when accomplished\nby bona fide material suppliers operating facilities serving the public in\ngeneral, are activities not covered by DBRA. This would be so even though the\nmaterials are delivered directly into a contractor’s mixing facilities at the\nwork site. Such bona fide material suppliers are not considered contractors\nunder DBRA. Thus, their employees are not subject to DBRA labor standards. (See\nalso FOH 15b04 and 15e22.) (b)  A particular facility set up at or near a construction\nsite for the purpose of fulfilling the material requirements of a contract and\nthus subject to the DBRA initially, may undergo a change in its character to\nsuch an extent that it becomes the operation of a “supplier.” This would be so,\nfor example, if it makes a sufficient quantity of sales from its producing\nfacility to the general public. What constitutes a “sufficient quantity” of\nsales to the general public depends on the circumstances in each case, but must\nbe more than mere token sales. (c)   If a material supplier, manufacturer, or carrier\nundertakes to perform a part of a construction contract as a subcontractor, its\nlaborers and mechanics employed at the site of the work would be subject to\nDBRA in the same manner as those employed by any other contractor or\nsubcontractor. Employees of a material supplier who are required to perform\nmore than an incidental amount of construction work in any w/w at the site of\nwork would be covered by the DBRA and due the applicable wage rate for the\nclassification of work performed. This would include warranty and/or repair\nwork. For example, if an employee of a supplier of precast concrete items is\nrequired to go to the project site to repair and clean such items and in so\ndoing performs more than an incidental amount of construction activity on the\ncontract, the individual would be subject to DBRA. Similarly, an employee of an\nequipment rental dealer or tire repair company who performs on-site repair work\non leased equipment is subject to DBRA if the employee performs more than an\nincidental amount of work on the site. For enforcement purposes, if such an\nemployee spends more than 20% of his/her time in a workweek engaged in such\nactivities on the site, he/she is DBRA covered for all time spent on the site\nduring that workweek. (d)  29 CFR § 5.2(l) specifically excludes from the\ndefinition of “site of the work” permanent fabrication plants, batch plants,\nborrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards, etc., of a commercial supplier or\n“materialman” that are established by a supplier of materials for the project\nbefore opening of bids and are near to but not on the actual project site, even\nwhere such operations for a period of time may he dedicated exclusively, or\nnearly so, to the performance of a contract. (See FOH 15b04(b) and 29 CFR\n5.2(l).)",
