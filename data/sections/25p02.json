  "text": "Any reasonable agreement between the parties which takes into\nconsideration all the pertinent facts, within the meaning of IB 785.23, is\npermissible in determining hours worked by exempt house-parents for MW\ncompliance purposes. NOTE: With regard to FOH\n25p00, a word of explanation is in order. Sec 13(b)(24)(A) is followed by the\nword “and” rather than the word “or” which appears in the FLSA as amended. The\nreason we have done this in the FOH is because extensive and exhaustive\nresearch has made clear that the ‘74 Amendments contained an error in wording.\nThat is, in order to remain logically consistent with all that was stated on\nthe Record concerning this exemption, it is obvious that the word “and” rather\nthan “or” should have been printed between points (A) and (B):see p. 10, Sec 17 of Public Law 93-259 in FOH Vol I. Thus, it has been\ndetermined that the word “and’ is correct and should be used in construing the\nexemption. That is why we put “and” in FOP. 25p00, and also why there are no\nquotation marks at the beginning and end of the exemption, since it is not an\nexact quotation.",
