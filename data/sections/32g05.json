  "text": "As\na result of judicial decisions, the failure of the pay arrangement to meet the\n“excessivity” standard referred to in IB 778.408 and 778.410-.414 is no longer considered\nsufficient in itself to be a controlling criterion in testing the validity of a\nSec 7(f) contract. In substance, the “excessivity” standard contemplated that\nthe relationship between the hourly rate specified in the contract and the\namount of the guaranty must be such that the employee would have worked or\ncould reasonably have been expected to work sufficient hours to earn in excess\nof the guaranty in a significant number of weeks and thus demonstrate that the\nregular rate was designed to be operative in controlling the compensation. The\nweight to be given to a failure to meet this standard will depend on all the\nfacts and the total situation. While the courts have declined to accept the\nview that validity of a pay arrangement under Sec 7(f) may be tested by this\nstandard alone, the factors involved still may have evidential bearing, at\nleast in conjunction with other pertinent considerations, on the bona fides of\nthe contract. In situations where the fluctuations in weekly hours seem plainly\nunrelated to the guaranteed contract hours (for example, the employee’s hours\nordinarily fluctuate between 35 and 45 or 50 but the contract guaranty covers\n60 hours), the bona fides of the contract are subject to doubt . It is unlikely\nthat under a bona fide contract an employer will pay week after week for more\nhours than actually worked.",
