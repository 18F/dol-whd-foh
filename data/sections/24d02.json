  "text": "(a)   IB 782.7(b)(1) contains an enforcement\npolicy with respect to motor carrier transportation of property or passengers\nwithin a single State which provides that any such movement which is in\ninterstate commerce under the FLSA will be considered a movement in interstate\ncommerce under the Motor Carrier Act (Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act)\nexcept where the DOT or the courts hold otherwise. However, as stated in IB\n782.7(b)(2), the DOT has held that transportation confined to points in a\nsingle State from a storage terminal of commodities which have had a prior\nmovement by rail, pipeline, motor, or water from an origin in a different State\nis not in interstate commerce within the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act if the\nshipper has no fixed and persisting transportation intent beyond the terminal\nstorage point at the time of the shipment. It has been specifically found that\nthere is no fixed and persisting intent where the following three conditions\nare present: (1) \nAt the time of\nshipment there is no specific order being filled for a specific quantity of a\ngiven product to be moved through to a specific destination; (2) \nThe terminal storage\nis a distribution point or local marketing facility from which specific amounts\nof the product are sold or allocated; and (3) \nTransportation in the\nfurtherance of this distribution within the single State is specifically\narranged only after sale or allocation from storage. The\nterm “fixed and persisting transportation intent” as used by the DOT refers to\nthe intent of the shipper of the commodities into the State, who may or may not\nalso be the importer. If in applying the tests set out in (1) through (3) above\nit is determined that there was no such intent on the part of the shipper, the\ninterstate movement of the commod­ities under the Motor Carrier Act ends with\ndelivery to a terminal storage facility even where a “practical continuity of\nmovement” through the terminal (Jacksonville Paper rule) makes the subsequent\nmovement of all or part of the commodities from terminal storage to a\ndestination in the same State a part of their movement in interstate commerce\nunder the FLSA. Thus, in situations where the three tests are in fact met, as\nhas been found to be true with respect to movement of petroleum products\nthrough pipeline and water terminals, such a subsequent movement would be\nconsidered a separate intrastate movement under the Motor Carrier Act even\nthough the importer ordered the out-of-State goods in anticipation of the needs\nof a stable group of specified customers, or to meet the needs of particular\ncustomers pursuant to an understanding with them, or to fill previously\nreceived orders of his customers. However, these facts which demonstrate a\n“practical continuity of movement” under FLSA may, in par­ticular cases, also demonstrate\nthat one or more of the three DOT condi­tions are not met, and must be\ncarefully examined with this in mind in any situation in which the application\nof the tests to the facts present in such situation has not specifically been\ndetermined by the DOT. (b)   In some situations the shipper is also\nthe importer, as would be the case where a manufacturer, such as a bakery,\nproduces goods in one State and moves them through his distribution point in\nanother State to his cus­tomers in that State. The employer, as the shipper,\nknows at the time of the shipment what he intends to do with the goods after\nthey reach his out-of-State distribution point. If, as would normally be the\ncase, there is a “practical continuity of movement” of the out-of-State goods\nthrough the firm’s distribution point to its customers, this is sufficient to\nestablish a “fixed and persisting transportation intent” beyond the\ndistribution point for purposes of applying Sec 13(b)(1). (c)   Transportation within a single State of\npetroleum products from pipeline or water terminals, as ordinarily performed,\nhas specifically been held by the DOT to be in intrastate rather than\ninterstate commerce within the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act. Employees\nengaged in such transporta­tion, if covered on traditional or enterprise\ngrounds under FLSA, are not within the Sec 13(b)(l) exemption. (d)   Transportation within a single State from\na chain store warehouse to outlets of the chain, of goods brought into the\nState for sale at the outlets, is covered on traditional “in commerce” grounds\nunder the FLSA and is also transportation in interstate commerce under the\nMotor Carrier Act. The Sec 13(b)(l) exemption applies to the drivers, drivers’\nhelpers, loaders and mechanics concerned with such transportation. This has\nbeen established in the courts and the DOT determination in paragraph (a) above\nhas no application. The situation of the chain store warehouse differs in\nessential respects from that of the terminals considered by the DOT in its\ndecision. As the courts have uniformly held, the situation in the chain store\ncases is one where goods are shipped from one State and briefly ware­housed in\nanother for the convenience of the owner in making an efficient distribution of\nthose goods to its local retail outlets. All goods ordered from other States\nfor delivery to the warehouse are ordered to supply the needs of the retail\nstores, and the shipper will know or can be presumed to know that these stores\nare the ultimate destination of the goods shipped. Transportation of goods from\nthe warehouse to the retail outlets is typically scheduled for the most part on\na continuing basis, rather than only after specific items have been sold or\nallocated from storage. (e)   Transportation within a single State from\nthe warehouse of an independent wholesaler or supplier of goods ordered from\nother States to meet the needs of an associated or allied group of retail\nstores may be assumed to be in interstate commerce within the meaning of the\nMotor Carrier Act for purposes of Sec 13(b)(l) pending further clarification by\nDOT or the courts, if the warehouse serves such stores exclusively and the\nsituation is in other res­pects comparable to the chain store situation\ndiscussed in paragraph (c) above. (f)   In situations other than those in (b),\n(c), (d), and (e) above, the CO shall make every effort to determine the “fixed\nand persisting transportation intent” of the shipper by ascertaining from the\ninformation available at the establishment under investigation whether the\nthree DOT tests are met. In the case of the typical wholesaler or supplier this\nwill generally present no problem because the facts will be available to show\nwhether tests (2) and (3) in (a) above are met and the presence or absence of\nany transportation intent beyond the importer’s establishment on the part of\nthe shipper can ordinarily be demonstrated from the importer’s purchase orders,\ninvoices, and other similar records. In the event the CO is unable to resolve\nthe question from information available at the establishment under investigation,\nhe shall make no attempt to contact the shipper. In such situations the matter\nshall be referred promptly to the AD and the ARA shall be contacted as\nnecessary for additional guidance or to consult the RS as appropriate.",
