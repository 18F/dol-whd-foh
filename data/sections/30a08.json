This may be done by\nappending a note to that effect or by superimposing such a notation by a stamp\nor other means across that part of the poster which pertains to the statutory\nOT requirements. For example, in the case of railroad employees, the notation\nmay be worded as follows: “OVERTIME PROVISION NOT APPLICABLE TO RAILROAD\nEMPLOYEES” (Sec 13(b)(2).)”",
