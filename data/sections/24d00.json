  "text": "(a)   The delivery of newspapers within the\nState in which they are printed is not transportation over which the DOT has\njurisdiction. While such delivery drivers are engaged in the interstate\ncommunication or transmission of news so as to be covered by the FLSA, they are\nnot transporting property (the newspaper) in interstate or foreign commerce\nwithin the meaning of the Motor Carrier Act. (b)   Certain newspapers of the type described\nin (a) above contain as an integral part weekly supplements, such as comics,\nmagazines and the like, which are produced outside the State. If these\nsupplements are obtained by the news­paper in complete and finished form and no\nprocessing work is performed on them by the newspaper establishment, the\nmovement within the State of the supplements printed out of State constitutes\npart of a practical continuity of movement of the goods from the point of\norigin to the ultimate destina­tion. Thus, the Sec 13(b)(1) exemption is\napplicable to the delivery drivers who transport and deliver the newspaper\ncontaining the supplements. The temporary storage of the supplements at the\nnewspaper establishment awaiting insertion into the paper does not change the\ninterstate character of the transportation.",
