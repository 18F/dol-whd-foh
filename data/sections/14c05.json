  "text": "(a)   Contracts for the carriage or transportation of goods\nor personnel must be actually governed by published tariff rates for such\ncarriage in order for the Section 7(3) exemption to apply. An administrative\nexemption has also been provided for certain contracts where such carriage is subject\nto Section 10721 of the Interstate Commerce Act. (See 41 U.S.C. 356(3); 29\nC.F.R. 4.118, 4.123(d)(3); FOH 14c00(c).) (b)  \nThe Section 7(3) exemption does\nnot apply where the principal purpose of the contract is packing, crating,\nhandling, loading, and/or storage of goods prior to, or following, line-haul\ntransportation to the ultimate destination. The fact that substantial local\ndrayage to and from the contractor’s establishment may also be required does\nnot alter the fact that the principal purpose of such a contract is other than\nthe carriage of freight. However, if a firm has a separate contract for\ntransportation subject to a published tariff rate, the Section 7(3) exemption\nwould apply to that contract. (See 29 C.F.R. 4.118; FOH 14c00(c).)",
