  "text": "The\nfact that a collective bargaining or employment agreement does not specify the\nexact hours that are to constitute the workday does not preclude application of\nFLSA Sec 7(e)(7), nor is it necessary that the contract or agreement\nspecifically provide for premium pay for hours “outside the workday”. If in\npractice the parties have arranged for payment of not less than time and\none-half a bona fide rate for hours outside of a workday, the practice will be\ndeemed to modify the terms of the original contract or agreement . For example,\nif a contract provides for payment of time and one-half for hours beyond 8 in a\nday or 40 in a week, but in practice the employees normally work from 8 a. m.\nto 5 p.m. with 1 hour for lunch, the payment of time and one-half for the hours\nbefore 8 a.m. and after 5 p.m. will be accepted as compliance with FLSA Sec\n7(e)(7). Furthermore, where the scheduled hours of the workday vary from time\nto time because of unforeseen contingencies, this fact does not preclude the\nacceptance of such a workday as an established workday under Sec 7(e)(7). Where\nthe above conditions are met, the OT premiums are valid under Sec 7(e)(7)\nregardless of the number of hours during the basic, normal workday or workweek.",
