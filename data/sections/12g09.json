In order to provide these\nservices such organizations may employ such personnel as house directors or\nhouse mothers, cooks, maids, etc. These employees are generally paid from\nrevenues derived from the charges to members for items such as room, board, and\ndues. in the ordinary case these organizations are controlled and operated by\nthe national and local chapter organization and the degree of supervision and\ncontrol by the educational establishment is likely to be quite casual and\nnominal. As a general rule WH does not consider the operation of these\nfraternity and sorority houses as a part of the college or university\nenterprise within the meaning of Secs 3(r) and 3(s)(5). (b)          \nThere may be instances where the\nfacts demonstrate that certain activities such as the provision of student\nmeals and lodging in the fraternity and sorority houses are part of the\nuniversity enterprise, as could be the case, for example, where the university\nowns the houses or exercises a high degree of supervision and control. In such\ndoubtful situations, a careful study of the fraternity or sorority charter\nprovisions and the university rules applicable to such houses would be\nessential in making a determination. (c)           \nWhile the general rule excludes\nstudent meal and lodging activities in fraternity and sorority houses from\nenterprises coverage under Sec3(s)(5), the possible application of Sec 3(s)(1)\nto the fraternity or sorority enterprise should not be overlooked.",
