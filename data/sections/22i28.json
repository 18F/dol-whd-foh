They are management functions for purposes\nof meeting the primary duty test for executives, as these functions relate to\nthe maintenance of production and sales records, and to providing security of\nthe employer’s property.  Training\nof employees, including a new manager, is also exempt management work under 29\nCFR § 541.102.  Working\nas a station attendant is nonexempt work. Substantial nonexempt work cannot be\nroutinely assigned to an employee without calling into question the application\nof the exemption to that employee. However, so long as an otherwise exempt\nstation manager only performs attendant duties occasionally, for up to a full\nday, a few times per year, at infrequent intervals, the primary duty test will\nstill be met.
