Thus, if an employer employs only 8 (or 12\nunder old Sec l3(a)(l5) employees in the named logging operations, and employs\nother employees in operations not named in the exemption, such as sawmill\noperations, the exemptions are not defeated because of the fact that he employs\nmore than 8 (or 12 under old Sec 13(a)(15)) employees altogether. The\nexemptions will not apply, however, to those employees employed in operations\nnot named in the exemption. (See IB 788.14.)",
