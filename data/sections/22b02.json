  "text": "(a)  \nWhether an employee “customarily and regularly directs the\nwork of two or more other employees” under 29 CFR § 541.100(a)(3) depends on\nall the facts. “Customarily and regularly” means greater than occasional but\nmay be less than constant; it includes work normally and recurrently performed\nevery workweek, but does not include isolated or one-time tasks.  The fact that\nan occasional workweek passes when an otherwise exempt executive does not give\ndirect instructions to subordinate employees will not defeat the exemption,\nprovided the executive in fact customarily and regularly directs the\nsubordinate employees’ work.  In addition, in certain instances, a supervisor\n(such as a district sales manager) may not work at the same time or within the\nsame establishment as the assigned subordinates being supervised; this will not\ndefeat the exemption if the criteria of 29 CFR § 541.100(a)(3) in fact are\nmet.   29\nCFR §§ 541.100, 541.701 WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2006-35  (b)  \n“Two or more other employees” means two full-time employees\nor the equivalent (29 CFR § 541.104).  For example, one full-time and two\nhalf-time employees are equivalent to two full-time employees.  Four half-time\nemployees are also equivalent to two full-time employees.  Full-time generally\nmeans someone who works 40 or more hours per week.  If occasional, temporary or\npart-time employees are involved when determining if the two full-time employee\nequivalency is met, an exempt executive must supervise two or more employees\nfor a combined total of 80 hours of work by such employees.  In other words,\nthe total number of hours worked by subordinate employees supervised must\nordinarily total 80 within the workweek to qualify as the equivalent of two\nfull-time employees. If a full-time employee works over 40 hours in the\nworkweek, he or she counts as the equivalent of only one employee. For example,\nif a full-time employee works 60 hours per week and a part-time employee works\n20 hours per week, although the two employees together work a total of 80\nhours, an equivalent of only one full-time and one part-time employee is\nsupervised, thereby not meeting the criteria. Only other employees of the\nemployer may be considered when determining if the two full-time employee\nequivalency is met; supervision of volunteers, employees of independent\ncontractors, or any other “non-employees” (trainees, interns) in relation to\nthe employer are not considered for purposes of this test.  29\nCFR § 541.104 69\nFR 22135WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2007-03  Fact\nSheet #71 (c)  \nThe supervisory function can be distributed among two,\nthree or more exempt executives, but each executive must customarily and\nregularly direct the work of two or more other full-time employees or the\nequivalent.  For example, a department with five full-time nonexempt workers\nmay have up to two exempt supervisors if each supervisor customarily and\nregularly directs the work of two full-time nonexempt workers.  However, the\nhours worked by a subordinate employee may not be counted or credited more than\nonce for different executives. Thus, shared responsibility to supervise the\nsame two employees in the same department does not meet the requirement that\nthe executive direct the work of two or more employees or their equivalent.  On\nthe other hand, a full-time employee who works half of the time for one\nsupervisor and the other half of the time for a different supervisor may be\ncredited as a half-time employee for each of the supervisors.  However, if a\nfull-time employee usually works more than 40 hours per week and the employer\nwants to “split” this employee’s time evenly between two supervisors, then each\nsupervisor is still supervising only one-half of this full-time employee’s\ntime.  Subdividing one full-time employee’s time between more than one\nsupervisor for purposes of this test should never add up to more than one\nfull-time employee Also,\nthere is no requirement that the manager work at the same time or at the same\nlocation as the subordinates in order to qualify for the exemption, as long as\nthe manager regularly directs the subordinate’s work. WHD\nFLSA Opinion Letter August. 21, 1978WHD\nFLSA Non-Administrator Letter November 8, 1979WHD\nOpinion Letter FLSA 2006-35  (d)  \nWHD has occasionally accepted a lower full-time workweek\nstandard but only when unusual circumstances justified it in an industry (and\nnever because an individual employer’s rules defined full-time as something\nless than 40 hours per week for purposes of pension or benefit plan\nparticipation or other reasons). The exception was limited to firms in\nindustries that had established workweeks of 37 ½ or 35 hours for full-time\nemployees, such as banking and insurance in the 1970s. For example, banks\nhistorically operated fewer hours each week compared to their normal business\noperations today – i.e., they were closed to the public by mid-afternoon on\nmost weekdays and did not open for business on weekends (thus, the term\n“banker’s hours” became known as a reference to a reduced workweek schedule\ncompared to the norm). Such qualifying circumstances no longer appear to be\npresent in the banking and insurance industries today. In the 2004 revisions to\nthe 541 regulations, WHD reinforced “its current interpretation that an exempt\nsupervisor generally must direct a total of 80 employee-hours of work each\nweek.” 69 FR 22135 (April 23, 2004) See also Perez v. Radioshack Corporation,\n386 F. Supp. 2d 979, 990 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (to “customarily and regularly”\ndirect work of two or more full-time employees, an exempt executive must\nsupervise 80 or more hours of subordinates’ time at least 80 percent of the\ntime to indicate frequency greater than occasional but less than constant).  29\nCFR § 541.701",
