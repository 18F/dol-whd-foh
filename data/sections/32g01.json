  "text": "(a)  \nEmployers should be encouraged to\nreduce FLSA Sec 7(f) contracts to writing, since a contract of this nature is\ncomplicated and proof both of its existence and of its compliance with the\nrequirement of Sec 7(f) may be difficult if it is an oral contract. It should\nbe kept in mind that Reg 516.24(c) requires, in the case of an oral agreement,\nthat a written memorandum summarizing the terms of the 7(f) agreement be made\nby the employer. Failure to maintain such a written memorandum would result in\na recordkeeping violation but would not of itself invalidate an otherwise valid\n7(f) contract or agreement. It may, however, in conjunction with other factors\npoint toward either the invalidity or nonexistence of such an agreement. (b)  \nA contract cannot be a one-sided\naffair. Therefore, the employee must not only be aware of, but must have agreed\nto, the method of compensation in advance of his performance of the work. (c)  \nThe contract whether oral or\nwritten must provide for compliance with all of the requirements of FLSA Sec\n7(f), and where there is a change in the specified rate or the number of hours\nfor which pay is guaranteed, the contract must be amended accordingly.",
