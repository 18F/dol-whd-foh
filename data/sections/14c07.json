  "text": "(a)   Coverage of the Act does not extend to contracts for\nservices to be performed exclusively by persons who are not service employees,\ni.e., persons who qualify as bona fide executive, administrative, or\nprofessional personnel as defined in the FLSA regulations found at 29 C.F.R.\nPart 541. For example, a contract for professional services performed\nessentially by bona fide professional employees, with the use of service\nemployees being only a minor factor in contract performance, is not covered by\nthe SCA. However, a contract for professional services that requires the use of\nservice employees to a significant or substantial extent (in terms of number of\nemployees or hours worked) is covered by the SCA, even though professional\nemployees may be used in the performance of the contract. (See 41 U.S.C.\n357(b); 29 C.F.R. 4.113(a)(3), 4.156; FOH 14b05.) (b)  In practice, a 10 to 20 percent guideline has been\nused to determine whether there is more than a minor use of service employees.\n(See Preamble at 48 Fed. Reg. 49736, 49743-44 (Oct. 27, 1983).) (c)   Coverage of the Act will not extend to contracts where\nit is contemplated that the services will be performed individually by the\ncontractor, and the contracting officer knows when advertising for bids or\nconcluding negotiations that service employees will in no event be used by the\ncontractor in providing the contract services.
