  "text": "(a)   Individual coverage depends on the nature of the\nparticular employee’s work. An employee is covered on an individual basis in\neach workweek in which he or she performs any work constituting engagement in\ninterstate or foreign commerce, or the production of goods for interstate or\nforeign commerce, including any closely related process or occupation directly\nessential to such production. As a practical matter, WH does not assert\nindividual coverage over an employee who is ordinarily engaged in employment\nwhich is not so covered but who may on isolated occasions spend an\ninsubstantial amount of time performing individually covered work. However,\nthis rule is not applicable in any workweek in which an employee spends a\nsubstantial amount of time doing individually covered work. If, in viewing the\nemployment over a more extended period, it is apparent that the pattern of\nindividual coverage is regular and recurrent, the employee involved is so\ncovered in each workweek in which he does such work, regardless of whether the\namount of time spent in this work is substantial or insubstantial. In\nsituations where an employer, for compliance purposes, seeks to segregate\nindividual coverage from other employment, the employer must be prepared to\ndemonstrate the basis of this segregation from his or her records. (b)   It is not possible to establish precise guidelines to\nbe followed in determining whether an employee who is not otherwise covered on an\nindividual basis spends an insubstantial amount of time on isolated occasions\nin the performance of individually covered work. In view of the remedial\npurposes of the Act, the application of this rule is limited to circumstances\nwhere the time consumed by an employee in doing such covered work is obviously\ntrivial, and the incidence of this covered work is so infrequent and\nout-of-pattern that it would be unrealistic to assert individual coverage\nsolely on such grounds. This must be decided on the facts in a particular case.",
