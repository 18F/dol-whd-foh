  "text": "(a)   Out-of-State goods of an intrastate wholesaler do not\ncome to rest until they reach the destination intended for them by the\nimporter. Normally, the destination intended for goods received for storage and\nsubsequent distribution in intrastate commerce is the place where they are held\nfor future distribution, such as shelves or storage bins, rather than the first\nplace at which they are set after unloading from the carrier. The fact that\nthere may be some delay in moving the goods from the point of unloading to the\nshelves or bins is an immaterial circumstance which does not alter the results. (b)   Thus any employee whose duties relate to the ordering\nof goods from other States is subject to the FLSA as engaged in interstate\ncommerce. This will include not only those who make telephone calls or send\ntelegrams, or write letters, or handle payments, all in connection with such\npurchases, but also employees who keep records of purchases, orders, and\nreceipts, or in any manner perform work which is materially related to the\npurchases. (c)   Employees engaged in receiving out-of-State goods are\nactually engaged in interstate commerce, and those whose work is materially\nrelated thereto are so closely related to the interstate movement as to be\nengaged in interstate commerce. (d)   Any employee whose duties includes the performance of\nthe following types of work, even after the out-of-State goods have been\nunloaded and deposited on the unloading platform or warehouse floor, is engaged\nin interstate commerce: (1)  checking goods against invoices; (2)  placing goods on shelves or in storage bins; (3)  making reports on missing or damaged goods; or (4)  entering articles received in interstate commerce in\nthe stock book.",
