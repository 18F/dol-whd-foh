  "text": "29\nCFR 570.33(c) prohibits 14- and 15-year-old minors from operating, tending,\nsetting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing all hoisting apparatus. \nThe term “hoist” refers to any apparatus for raising or lowering a load by the\napplication of a pulling force that does not include a car or platform running\nin guides.  29 CFR 570.34(n) prohibits these same minors from performing\nwork using \"lifting apparatus\" in connection with automobiles and\ntrucks. (a)  \nThe CL Reg 3 prohibition against\nthe operation of hoists is much broader than that of HO 7.  Under CL Reg 3,\nunlike HO 7, prohibited hoists do not have to be power-driven but can rely on\nmechanical or human power such as those that are operated by a “crank” or foot\npedal. (1)  Under CL Reg 3, the term hoist includes all types of\nhoists, such as base-mounted electric, clevis suspension, hook suspension,\nmonorail, overhead electric, simple drum and trolley suspension hoists.   (2)  Under CL Reg 3, 14- and 15-year-olds are prohibited\nfrom using most kinds of hoisting and lifting equipment, such as hydraulic “grease\nrack” lifts used in gasoline service stations, tire stores and other\nestablishments servicing automobiles, as well as service racks and hand jacks,\neven if that machinery did not fit within the definition of a hoist or lifting\napparatus, because Reg 3 does not explicitly permit the use of such equipment. \nSee 29 CFR 570.32. (b)  \nForklifts.  A forklift is a type of power-driven industrial\nhighlift truck used for lateral transportation.  It is equipped with a\npower-operated device, usually in the form of a fork or platform, capable of\ntiering loaded pallets or skids one above the other.  Minors 14- and\n15-years-old may not operate or tend a forklift under CL Reg 3 because it is\nboth a hoist and a piece of power-driven machinery.  These CL Reg 3 prohibitions\nalso preclude 14- and 15-year-olds from riding on a forklift and working from a\nforklift. (c)  \nDumbwaiters.  Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are generally prohibited\nfrom operating any hoisting devices, but 29 CFR 570.34(i) permits such minors\nto operate dumbwaiters when used to perform work involved with the preparing\nand serving of food.   (d)  \nMinors 14 and 15 years of age\nwould also be prohibited from operating or tending those hoists found in large\nretail stores that are designed to move individual shopping carts from one\nfloor to the next.  These devices, often constructed in conjunction with\nescalators, are both power-driven machinery and hoisting machines.",
